1	Arrived broken. Manufacturer defect. Two of the legs of the base were not completely formed, so there was no way to insert the casters. I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process.
1	the cabinet dot were all detached from backing... got me
1	I received my first order of this product and it was broke so I ordered it again. The second one was broke in more places than the first. I can't blame the shipping process as it's shrink wrapped and boxed.
1	This product is a piece of shit. Do not buy. Doesn't work, and then I try to call for customer support, it won't take my number. Fucking rip off!
1	went through 3 in one day doesn't fit correct and couldn't get bubbles out (better without)
1	Poor quality. The material was fuzzy from day one. It got discolored in less than a month, even though we kept it outdoors under a covered porch. I returned this item.
1	Ordered 2 they shipped 1 promised by certain day, then the next day, then the next day.
1	Followed directions, did not work as advertised.
1	There is a terribly done band across the top. Supposed to keep the shirt on your shoulders but seems more of like a waistband.
1	Unless you have this jam-packed full of items, the unit collapses on itself. I never held it's shape therefore, making it hard to reach my items when I needed them. The silver metal pieces on the handle fell off soon after it arrived. I must have missed the "return by" date as I now am stuck with it.
1	I am disappointed in this purchase. I bought one of these in another color and in size XL and it fit great. This one I bought in white in XL and it fits like a Medium. I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.
1	It doesn’t work after less than a month. The contacts on the connection are cheap. Don’t waste your money.
1	was not pleased and Bluetooth malfunctioned after a couple of weeks
1	Followed instructions, and never caught a mosquito.
1	Absolutely horrible. Fingerprints, face prints, smudgy and impossible to use in sunlight! Literally cannot see screen. Want my money back, and going to go find the one i used before!
1	Does not play with with the two cases i bought. I'd request a refund but mines already cracked from the cases.
1	Doesn’t work and tried contacting via email based off of the card that came with the item. Email does not work.
1	Beautiful way. Does not stay paired with or connected to my daughter’s iPhone. Essentially useless other that to tell time.
1	Stems were broken due to poor packing. Shapes are way different from the pictures. Blemishes in the skin.
1	Buy one size smaller, they r BIG
1	I had problem with the 2 screen protectors, any of them paste well on the screen. Very disappointing because I also bought the complete screen protection and I hope not happening the same thing...
1	The product was faulty and seller offered refund and asked that I take down my previous bad review. It's been 2 weeks and I still haven't seen a refund. The diffuser worked fine for about a month (long enough to be out of the return policy) then stopped. Not worth the $40
1	Do not bother buying these toys. Didn’t even last 1 day.
1	I never got my item even though it said delivered.
1	I used to have a much used & well loved OXO cookie scoop that was lost in our last move. I bought another in October and took it out today to use for my Christmas baking. It fell apart like other reviewers have complained on the third cookie. I'm very disappointed with the quality of the new product.
1	May update IF I ever receive this item! After 2 weeks...Received a notice saying the usps claimed it was undeliverable to this address... not like I haven’t received a thousand items here from Amazon and mail in general. Usps said they can’t even look into it since NO tracking number was provided. Not pleased.
1	Totally uncomfortable
1	Wrong size for my husband. I need to return them, unfortunately.
1	They start off working well but eventually the microphone stops working and the ear pieces electrocute you no matter the volume your phone is on.
1	Not 3 pieces just one sheet
1	Tom Clancy has company as the most uselessly over descriptive writer. Also I suspect the author is a virgin. Absolutely terrible.
1	I ordered this book on February 11. It never arrived.
1	We order two different types of jewelry from this company the other jewelry we order is perfect. However with this jewelry I have a few things I don't like. The little Stone comes out of these and customers are complaining and bringing them back and we are having to put new jewelry in their holes. You cannot sterilize these in an autoclave as well because it heats up too much and the glue does not hold up so the second group of these that we used I did not sterilize them that way and the stones still came out. When I use a dermal clamp to put the top on the stones come out immediately. DO not waste your money on this particular product buy the three mm. that has the claws that hold the jewelry in those are perfect. So now I'm stuck with jewelry that I can't sell not good for business.
1	The barbell pad is fine but the ankle strap is terrible. It does not hold well at all. I guess I’ll havw to return everything.
1	This product caused severe burning of my skin. I have used other brands with no problems
1	Only worked for about a month and now dead?
1	Absolutely cannot get lotion out of bottle... despite storing it upside down! I will have to throw out.f
1	It typically works for a few turns and then nothing comes out after that. I would shake it to try to get peppercorns to feed but that never really helped much. Only emptying it, clearing the neck and reloading it would get it working again for a few more turns. Seems like the neck is too narrow and gets clogged inside. I finally tossed it out because even the disposable McCormick pepper grinder works consistently without all the fuss.
1	this was a birthday present when she opened the box the glass was broke and the light bulb was hanging it is really cute but don't bother really not worth the hassel
1	Was not a kit, was only a small individual box of lipstick.
1	The wicker baskets all unravel. Cheaply made. I reached out for replacements and heard nothing back. Going to send the whole thing back.
1	My best friend got this mattress before summer started and I've slept on it many times and I get the best sleep at her house. I asked for the mattress as a birthday present, I opened it on the 9th and as I was unrolling it i was starting to smell something musty but i thought it could be because it just traveled in a box for a few days. It's now the 12th and my ENTIRE BOTTOM FLOOR WREAKS OF SOME NASTY MUSTY SMELL. It smells like the bed is rotting. OH and the mattress I ordered is classified as a 6inch mattress but its measuring between 4 and 4 1/2 inches... 3 days later. Today is the first day I have done anything other than touch with my fingers or sniff. The bed feels very firm and if you sniff it you will want to gag. I've already filed through amazon that I'd like a replacement. I'm just puzzled how the mattresses could be so different. We both slept on her brand new, 6 inch, Zinus mattress less than 24 hours after she opened it but mine is like I picked it up off the side of the road. When I get the new mattress I'll edit my review accordingly.
1	This does not work for an iPhone 8.
1	If you are never going to wash your window or get dust on it maybe it won't scratch instantly... Little twigs hit it and it scratches.... Haven't been able to see out of it since the second ride I went on... JUNK
1	Terrible. Doesn’t even charge waste of my money.
1	This case initially looked great. It was clear and sturdy. Fast forward a few months and it has taken on an ugly brown discoloration. It isn't just that it's dirty. Its as though the thermoplastic has spoiled and reacted to the air. I'd return it if it was still within the return window but unfortunately I don't still have that option. Very disappointed.
1	My mom loves the mild compression of the knee high but says the top is too loose and falls down. She cannot wear them. I was after a looser top because the others cut into her leg and stop circulation. Any suggestions?
1	Globe Department Store is where money came from.I have used Pure Grace for 10 years and this bottle smells like rubbing alcohol. I'm taking it to a lab with my real bottle for analysis. this stuff smells totally fake.
1	Cheap all peeled off in less than a month
1	Junk. Won't hold a charge anymore. Should have purchased the actual Black & Decker brand. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for, etc. Buyer beware.
1	It’s used by many people wasn’t new at all Very stringy and stretch our hair was falling out of the wig
1	Would a great timer if it was waterproof. It would seem like something that is being used outdoors in most cases would be waterproof especially something controlling sprinklers. I had one growing season but failed a few weeks into the following season after the control shorted out after getting wet. It performed so well that I thought I would just try another and cover the control as best I could with a plastic bag. It failed after only a few months and for the same reason even after protection.
1	It was easy to use yes. But it didn’t hardly give any color. The color I had was very spotty! It took using over half of the bottle to even start to notice anything.
1	Leaked, the very first try
1	Seemed like a nice pen, but I couldn’t even get a decent line out of it. Disappointing.
1	Very difficult to clean.
1	After reading and watching the other reviews I decided to order this hair and I hate that I did. This hair is on the level of some low equality Beaty supply pack hair and to be honest I’ve had some better pack hair then this “ virgin hair”. I had a blunt cut straight bob and it kept flipping up like a kick stand. I li tried it curled and the curls dropped within a hour or so. These other reviewers are either lying, never had good quality hair or got a better batch than me. Idk!!LADIES ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK
1	is very tide and very uncomfortable
1	I like the looks of the clock; however, it is defective. I put in battery, but the clock does NOT work.
1	It charged and worked like a dream for about a week, then had some difficulty charging, and now will not charge at all, despite trying every fix found online. What a shame. Past the return window, of course.
1	Not a good product at all. The adhesion is nonexistent. Do not waste your money. I gave up on this product and used my old Note 4 tempered class. I was most definitely taken in by the hype.
1	Packing was horrible, they packed it in a bag. By the time I received it, it was crushed. I hope the film still works.
1	This stuff is whiter than any porcelain surface you will encounter, making it stick out like a sore thumb.
1	The thing doesnt even work
1	The battery life on the barrier transmitter is terrible. It’s plugged in more than its used to do its job and the transmitter isn’t functional when it’s plugged in. It’s a constant struggle to check and see what’s the status of the battery. In the mean time, the dog continues to eat couch cushions realizing his collar isn’t beeping today! Terrible waste of money.
1	It came with a broken clip to hold the legs .... I had to use a knife to shave the plastic on the legs to get it to slide to lick into place .... not to happy
1	I bought 2 of these and one of my golden retrievers chewed a big chunk off. I was contacted after leaving an instagram review and they told me there are fake companies out there making the product with silicone instead of rubber my dog is not a big chewer and easily chewed a piece off...thankfully spit it out before he swallowed any...so i'm out 26.00 because they both went in the garbage....dog owners please be careful.
1	The first time is very good, very handy, but more than two times on the water, is not very normal. I gave him credit. Deleted.
1	I received a flesh colored product when I had ordered the black.
1	Polishing filter defective. Contacted the company got no response .
1	This board could have been a perfect board for my son, but the stain does not come out from white board and the white board plastic (the materiel) started getting wrinkles. It is difficult to get any thing out of white board for adults, kids cannot remove it at all with the eraser or a cloth.
1	Waste of money or fake i tried so hard to fix even smallest scratch but no result.
1	It does not work. When i plugged in it shows the status light but it does not work. very disappointed with the purchase.
1	Unfortunately this product didn’t work at all for us. Firstly, it was too big for our small dog, even though the description says this was designed for small dogs. (We have a pug/french bulldog mix, so she’s on the thicker side of small.) We could have worked with the size, but it was pretty much broken from the get go. Not sure if we got a defective product, but after the batteries ran down once the receiver wouldn’t recharge. Either the charger or receiver was broken, maybe both. We couldn’t get the receiver to sync with the remote, every time we pressed the reset button as instructed the receiver wouldn’t beep, and it didn’t seem to be able to charge. This was kind of an expensive product and was highly reviewed, so we are pretty disappointed. We will be returning it.
1	This product didn’t come, and if it would have came it took about 3 months to come.
1	Smells terrible and washed out a lot of my color. Not happy with purchase
1	I just received it and the packaging had been opened and the soleplate cleaner was no where to be found. All I have are the cleaning cloths. Very disappointed in something that had such rave reviews!!!
1	I try my best to be positive about my purchases from Amazon but this one I cannot be. This tree is the most cheaply made poorly constructed tree I’ve ever purchased. And now I have to keep it because I have three kids ready to decorate their Christmas tree this evening. This tree looks like it is been constructed by elementary school children and put together with glue. I am very unhappy with this purchase it looks nothing like the picture! My poor kids are going to be so sad as our tree falls apart!
1	Swollen two days after installation. Calibrated fine but ruined the track pad.
1	Never received my product!!!
1	Almost every peach balloon popped after a few mins of inflating. The color is very nice. I wish it was durable.
1	Don’t purchase. They have no cushion.
1	Did not get the Pom poms. Just received the globes and then fan like decorations. Super disappointed
1	Very disappointed in Amazon for allowing this vendor to swap software without any forewarning. Read two other reviews with the same issue.
1	Burned my skin and box looked like It was used
1	The antenna just get signal for like two channels and the picture quality was poor.
1	This screen protector does not fit. Waste of money.
1	The watch has great features. My only concern was that the screen was to hard to see. You can actually see the watch face better in direct sunlight. Inside where i work i can hard see the screen
1	Great Product but as time passes gets worse.
1	Terrible product. Had it for a few weeks and dropped my phone and the screen shattered from top to bottom. It might protect a phone if it lands on a corner or side, but if the screen lands flush to the floor, it will not protect it. Also, the power button is hard to push and the back piece does not work very well as a kickstand. It’s too flimsy.
1	I’ve purchased and used this filter several times and have never had any issues-until recently. This last one I received has been horrible! I installed and made sure it was locked into place. Ran about a gallon of water through and the water smells! and tastes like dirt/chemical! The water however is crystal clear but just horrible. I’m so disappointed considering I drink water constantly and was relying on what I thought was a quality product that had been consistent until now.
1	They should have made the base more red this attracts very few hummingbirds compared to the red one I bought at the dollar store...
1	Bought for a gift. Wouldn't dare give it, as it looks and feels so cheap. Not at all like the one I saw on TV.
1	When i ordered this item i was expecting to receive 5 little boxes as pictured... Nope one little box! Not worth the price!!!
1	The roll came in a box marked grape jelly... in the the mail which stayed in my box for 2 days 90 degree wether... It was pre frozen. Which drives it out....not alot of pumpkin taste for which I dare tried it... but cheap...
1	Terrible! Don't waste your money. It's a jap knockoff of realtor and it totally sucks! Could connect to my router but after that no dice.... no web access! Brilliant scam, well done!
1	Cute but definitely for a small child. My 6 year old grand daughter didn't want it because it wasn't a real violin.... :(
1	The product worked for maybe five minutes then it stopped and my iPhone said is not compatible with iphone
1	Phone does not work when plugged in to an active land line - no dial tone. Seller asked for pictures.
1	I bought these bottles with the intention of mixing essential oils in them. The spray hardly works and they leak frequently. Would not recommend for use with essential oils.
1	Two nights in the water tide to our dock in the lake..... I’d say something liked this.
1	I bought a package of three. Two of them have already stopped working and it's only been about six months. The use has been minimal. We each used one on our nightstand, and I kept an extra one in the office. We never traveled with them, never took them out of the house, and they just stopped working for no apparent reason.
1	The mouse is very light and the cord weight ends up pulling it off the table, also the red hexagon pattern at the back of the mouse does not have any holes like in the picture, its a solid piece of plastic with shapes cut into it, but not holes. Also it claims to be RGB, but really, you cant change the colors at all. Feels cheap. Very very disappointed. Wish I could get my money back
1	I DID EVERY SINGLE THING THE INSTRUCTIONS SAID, AND THIS STILL LEFT ME WITH NO SHINE, SLIGHTLY LIGHTER HAIR, AND DRY ENDS. THIS ONE WAS NOT A WINNER!!!!!! PS MY HAIR IS PROFESSIONALLY HIGHLIGHTED EVERY 5 WEEKS. SHE HAD TO DO A CONDITIONING TREATMENT ON MY HAIR! FROM NOW ON, ONLY CLEAR SHINE AT THE SALON FOR ME!!!
1	Received disc opened and non-functioning
1	Bought these for my homemade candles. The wicks are thin and do not keep a flame or burn out completely. Going to try doubling or tripling up and soaking in oil so they dnt go completely to waste.
1	It was too small for my headphones.
1	I was gently drying with a paper towel the residual water off of it, and the glass shattered. Only a bit over a month and using it sporadically. Too fragile !!! I wish it would come with a replacement. Aesthetically is beautiful but it’s not durable. I do not recommend.
1	This thing is a joke. 1. It doesn't provide warm steam. Am I wrong to assume steam is usually warm? This thing is a mister NOT A STEAMER. 2. It turns on for 3-5 seconds and then turns off. You have to shake it to get it to work again. 3. Instructions are in a foreign language.
1	These are whole teeth. They are not hollow. If you are missing a tooth these may be for you if you can get a proper adhesive!!!
1	This camera is a piece of shit.... won't connect to Wi-Fi, instructions are not clear at all and not contact information for cs to get help. Fucking waste of time. Annoyed that Amazon had this a featured product. It doesn't deserve even 1 star
1	This Case is no good. It looks great in the advertised photos but once the case is on the actual phone it’s no good. Does not fit right, the rubber piece coming off the hard plastic piece. Not very confident of protection if dropped
1	Please send another one with all the items. I still need the product.
1	The product never actually arrived, despite the tracking saying it was delivered. After looking all over to find a way to contact customer service about this, and finding nothing, I finally just ordered another one. So if you want to pay twice for something, then by all means, buy this.
1	Doesnt work well. It's harder to use the screen. It's not even the same as advertised. What a waste of money.
1	Had 10 days to deliver still not here
1	Color is faded out. But when you take a picture it enhances the color for some inexplicable reason!!! Don't waste your money. When you want to return it you have to pay for shipping so to cut your losses you wind up taking their ridiculous settlement/discount and just keep it. Then use it as a shower liner. What a scam! Beware of Amazon third party sellers and don't deal with this one.
1	These are the worst quality mats- we bought (2) for our house and neither mat is properly aligned. The edges are awfully cut and uneven.
1	When this mower arrived, I was delighted with its design and light weight. However, after a months use, the handle began to require constant tightening and attention. Eventually, the plastic adjustable handles wore out and I had to use wire to clamp the two sections together. Towards the end of the mowing season, the motor stopped working, apparently burned out. I have owned other corded electric mowers, including B&D and was impressed. However, this mower has driven me back to a gas-powered unit.
1	I had high hopes, but ... the products has a seriously unpleasant taste and aftertaste. The consistency isn't bad ... so glad I only bought 1 small bag.
1	First drop and it shattered. Had it on only 24 hours. A real shame because I was enjoying it until it broke.
1	Mozart is not in dispute. He and his life were rare supremacy. Unfortunately, the direction and camera work of this film is insulting to Mozart.
1	There’s where holes in almost a quarter of the silver ones I’m so disappointed I had to find a party city around me smh
1	They stopped working in 1 month. I am very disappointed.
1	Arrived and smelled terrible! I didn’t want to put any of my clothing in them so I put them in the washing machine on delicate/hand wash and this happened! Horrible quality such a disappointment and a huge waste of money.
1	I was so disappointed in this product. I was excited with it's functionality of the screen and a different color than black, along with the choices of colors of the keyboard. Unfortunately it's not as responsive as my fingers and misses words / letters and then it randomly adds periods and adds spaces. So frustrating. I didn't use it before I went out of town so I was stuck with it for a few days, drove me crazy!
1	returned . it would not recognize internet . standing next to netgear router says internet not available . tried for several hours and finally gave up . reset many times .
1	Love the feel of the sheet set but very disappointed in the cooling effect that your website describe. It is not at all cooling when sleeping. In fact tit gets really warm and still waking up sweating. This purchase was completely unsatisfied. I washed it so I have to keep it. I am very disappointed in this product.
1	My order history says I received this but I never did!! Was gonna order it but then realized I already did, but never got it. Where do I get this fixed!?
1	Very disappointed. Did not work with my black and decker blender as stated. When I used it, my blender started smoking. When I investigated the issue I realized that the rubber around blade had shredded and melted! I did not want to give it ANY stars. do not waste your money!
1	I really liked these sheets at first but after a few months they are shredded. They came apart and now have 18” holes in them. I definitely will not buy again!
1	returned. very cheap looking.
1	Extremely slow,couldn’t even use my Facebook app,after three days,I didn’t even Drop it,not once,it didn’t want to charge anymore,I put it for over eight hours,I recommend getting a Samsung or Apple tablet,don’t waste your time,even the refund is taking a long time to get,because it’s an Amazon product,I’m just extremely angry.
1	Easy to hold. Use it twice with perfect results. Two weeks later, it doesn't work at all. No idea what changed.
1	First of all, the color is definitely baby pink, not the taupe-ish dusty rose color that is pictured. Second, I would never consider this a wrap dress, I would say it’s a glorified kimono. Third, it’s completely see through and fourth, the boob area was way too baggy so unless you’re EXTRA blessed in the chest department this might just look like a saggy cheap robe. In spite of the high hopes I had for this “dress”, I’d have to say it’s a big thumbs down for me unfortunately.
1	Small and not very bright. We bought two sets and the driveway isn’t lit sufficiently at night. One light didn’t work. Won’t order again.
1	DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. NO SOUND COMES OUT OF BOTH HEADPHONE JACKS. ONLY ONE AT A TIME!
1	PAY FOR 2 GET 1. GO ELSEWHERE AS IT IS A RIP OFF.
1	I purchased 2 bookmarks and received them yesterday. Both screens don't work. I was about to return one, but now the other one said it is ineligible for a return/replacement. Not impressed.
1	My product says it was delivered, but, never was... Paid for something I never received, I even called, nothing has been done.
1	Just couldn't, force myself to finish this book.....I have never had this happen to me before.
1	I never got my stuff
1	the pump does not spin, only turns 270 degree s
1	Sound is distorted. Look elsewhere.
1	battery does not hold a charge as it should, have to recharge before each use, then slows down before finishing use.
1	I would not buy this if you want a good screen protector go somewhere else
1	Complete waste of money and false advertising. On the pictures it seems like it would taste good but when you get the product it is clearly not right. Do not buy this for your kids or yourself.
1	Big gaps around my side mirrors. Tap did not stick to my car or the product.
1	This app does not provide you with YouTube Kids videos.
1	Looks cheap. He didnt care of course. He liked it. But I prefer to wear things that look and feel of quality. It also runs large. Overall, waste of $$
1	The adhesive is only on the edges. Didn't stick all the way and was trapping dust. Also quite smudgey - I was always wiping the screen
1	You may or may not get a good batch. I thought it was my desktop, maybe program out of date. Not the case, I installed software on laptop same issue, ran updates, same issues. Went back to desktop, no difference. Some work some don’t, it has to do with the discs. Not worth buying. It’s not any of my hardware or software. I have made many copies of discs from cd’s to dvd’s. Have not come across this in the past.
1	If you’re a mobile detailer don’t waste your money on this foam gun , stopped foaming after 1 week , I had a better one which I already had but that one failed of me after a year and half of use just got this cause i thought it would last. Disappointed also the suction tube cracks very easily
1	This thing lasted about a week and broke in 3 different spots. These are junk do not buy!!!
1	We generally like Aden and Anais products, but this fitted sheet doesn’t seem so fitted. I’m actually concerned it’s so loose that’s its unsafe. Defective or are they all like this?
1	Was very disappointed it only lasted 1 week. The threads are horrible I connected a intex hose that came with a intex sand filter and the hose came straight off. The threads should of hold.
1	This is awful. It has good ingredients but really affected my eyes. My contacts felt blurry after a couple hours and I had to take them out as soon as I got home from work. I immediately wiped the eyeliner off with my makeup remover and my eyelids were so puffy the rest of the night and the next day. So disappointed because the color was a perfect black and seemed like it would stay on all day, but can't wear it again.
1	I received this order right before leaving for a long camping trip. It was missing the plug to close it. I contacted amazon. They could not help me with getting the missing piece, so I tried to contact the seller. They never responded to me.
1	After less than a month of wearing these, my kiddo has worn the tread down a ton & the sole is ripping off completely. I know these aren’t the most expensive of shoes, but I was planning on getting more than 3 weeks wear out of them.
1	Seller didn't deliver. Should have checked the sellers rating before purchasing, but I didn't. Amazons A to Z guarantee refunded my money!
1	Very poorly packaged and handled during shipping. One of the packs of coffee had busted open and was all over everything in this shipment.
1	No idea what happened with this order. Ordered two phones, on separate orders. Order and payment went through, and delivery date was given. On the day they were supposed to arrive, I got notification that the order was cancelled due to "damage to package". No idea, but wasted four days waiting for phones that never arrived. No communication asking about reshipping them, so it just sounded fishy all the way around.
1	Only 9 figurines arrived and 1 was broken.
1	The charger immediately didn’t work after unboxing it. It would only charge in certain positions.
1	It didn’t make it a year. Not sure if the sun broke down the material or what, but it tore by the strap after a couple month. Then we had some wind and they cover tore right in half. Ugh
1	Worthless---Am going elsewhere to buy one that works. no Threaded screw in ends for urn No phone # or contact #
1	Very cheap material, ripped almost instantly when wearing and putting hands in pocket. Would not recommend.
1	Did not work on my 15 watt solar charger mounted on my step van did not send back it cost $8 what the hell I'm a little disappointed solar charger works fine on my battery without the limiter
1	Broke an front of case came off often.
1	this item did not arrive on time. When I requested return, no immediate response. Once I receive the return label, the words on the label are very small. Overall the customer service is poor
1	I’ve been trying to curl my hair for hours and can not get it to do anything. The included instructions seem like someone put them in to google translate. I’m going to find more YouTube videos, but so far I’m totally bummed.
1	Price is expensive and very hard to use and also doesn’t even work. Don’t bother buying this a waste of money
1	I love Amazon & for the first time I am so disappointed with the item I received. The size is nothing compared to the pic & the color is way way pale. The piece I received has only a slim strip of amethyst down the middle of the rough outter stone & the color couldn't be lighter. I don't know how to return it.
1	I got this when I was a lot newer to crafting and it seemed like the roller would be a big help especially since most of the crafts I was doing were mod podge based. I opted to buy this here because it was cheaper than at the crafting stores like Michaels but regrettably paying any price for this was a waste. The roller does practically nothing. There's very little weight to it so it doesn't really give you much pressure other than your own when using and when you try to use it to spread mod podge it doesn't, it moves right over it or if you try to smooth something like paper after you've applied it nothing happens either. I've saved the rubber squeegee as I use that when handling some vinyl projects.
1	Didn’t receive what item from the picture & wasn’t able to charge more listen to music at the same time
1	Product damaged (chipped glass) when washing on top dishwasher shelf after only a few weeks. Inferior materials and product. I am very displeased with the quality of this item. This happened to several items in our set so not a “one off” defect.
1	Return in progress as item was not the advertised size. Fell at least 6 inches short in width.
1	Two in package, arrived on time. Neither one works.
1	I bought these as a gift and was sadly disappointed when they arrived. They were basically cheap plastic and looked the same. I returned them and bought a thicker glass made product.
1	Don’t Buy, not worth it.
1	Poorly made. Looks really cut in the picture but the padding is weird and the poor excuse for underwire was already coming out when I opened the box. You get what you pay for with this one.
1	This is made from cheap materials -- think styrofoam egg carton material. If you took it to the park, it could blow away. This should go for 24.99 and even then I bet they would be making a killing. Also, the pattern could be more fun or more vivid. I would get something else if I were to do it again. Let's see if it lasts the year.
1	Neither of my birds are the least bit interested in this toy, not once have they paid any attention to it.
1	Didn't get a thorn poking through, but the valve stem is made very weak - it cracked off where it attaches to the tube in less than 6 months of use. I will not buy this brand again.
1	Look awesome and help your wheelies a lot, when the tires stay on! I read the reviews about losing tires very easily so I glued them before I even installed them on my Stampede. Lost one a week later. For $20 it is a waste. Save your money for a better upgrade.
1	Mouse wheel already having issue. When I scroll up it scrolls down for a second sometimes an vice versa.
1	Didn’t work for my 16 months old baby. He still sucks his thumb even if I just put a few coats on his nail. Sad.
1	30% of the cups were stuck to each other and impossible to separate. Had friends and family try to pull them apart and no one was able to. Tried heat, tried cold - nothing worked. Extremely disappointed. The picture shows a stack of cups that comes apart and one that does not
1	Not what I anticipated. It's bulky and heavy. It doesn't recharge my phone it just maintains the level I plug it up in.
1	This product arrived with a bent pole and two missing rollers and not instructions to assemble. I promptly returned the item and went to a local store to purchase.
1	This company Home Online third party seller refuses to give your money back when a package is lost or missing. They are no help and dont care for the customer happiness.
1	I was very disappointed with the number of areas skipped during the cleaning. Pictures not picked up off the table so the entire table could be polished. Missed under the center of the dining room table. Vanity tray not cleaned. I would have stopped them from leaving if I would have noticed while they were there.
1	They didn’t last long before flickering on and off
1	Product charged fully, literally, two times and has not gone past one light since.
1	Horrible quality not safe for pets
1	Gave less than 10 of these treats to my 15 week old puppy, and she had diarrhea for a day and a half. We had to change her normal food just to get her to have solid poops again. I would double check the ingredients with your vet before use because it’s safe to say we have stopped feeding her these. I was really excited to try these treats as they weren’t too high in calorie compared to other training treats. The package came as pictured, but the treats were bigger than I thought they’d be. They smelled tasty and flavorful, so I’m sad they didn’t work out for our girl.
1	Only lasted a month before refusing to reconnect even after resetting. The instructions and set up website have poor grammar; I think this is a cheap Chinese knockoff-esque type of product.
1	I ordered a size down since I like the bands to feel snug and secure, but it was wayyyy too big. I cant even wear them because they slide down or roll up. Its unfortunate because I was so excited to order them! The material on the band also is not sticky enough to adhere to the pants. Wish I would've returned when I had the chance.
1	Good heavens. Is this a money-laundering scheme? How dare anyone make a movie this bad? Ham-fisted acting, amateur camera work, an insulting musical score consisting of the same repeated ood scary phrase.. A chimpanzee could have written better dialogue. Don't waste you time.
1	They worked great for the first 30 days... then died and wouldn’t even turn on. Was literally 1 day outside of the return window. When they did work, they sounded great.
1	Installed 6 months ago. Now, when in USB/iPod source, automatically Error 19. This is without anything in the USB input. Tried all fixes and solutions. 6 months for $100.00 is not worth it to me. Wish I had stayed away from this unit.
1	I bought the dress in a size medium, but it was way too big. The waist needed to be taken in a few inches. If it was smaller in the waist area, I think it would have had a more flattering appearance.
1	When the battery arrived put in laptop and it did not charge. It would not even light up laptop. This is the first item from Amazon that was not any good. Wanted to exchange for a good one but was told sending a refund.
1	Thia style of tap is garbage. These have failed every single time i ve used them, even after using pliers to seat tap and tape to hold the assembly together. They damage the supply wire terribly, often leaving only 3 or 4 strands unbroken. Do not buy these. Watch a few youtube videos on splice taps if you feel you need to run power from an existing component feed.
1	It doesn’t fit tight into the outlet and will come unplug very easily, most of the time without me knowing right away.
1	Charges with no issue but will not record. Lights flash yellow and blue for 5 seconds and then shuts off. Computer recognizes the SD card that's in the pen when inserted into USB slot.
1	Product arrived late
1	Not a good replacement. Never fully charges no matter how long I let it charge, and only lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.
1	Engine does not shoot. Faulty piece. Boxes it and procrastinated the return, but Amazon blocked the return. This sucks!!
1	No directions. Looked around online and found the site they had directions but were very unclear. Once I figured it out I realized the auger does not fit into the part it's supposed to fit into. Don't know how I'll be able to use it and sure wish I'd looked it over when I first got it because I"m pretty sure it's too late to return it.
1	The wrong angel showed up. The angel with a dog showed up when I ordered the cat one
1	Receive dead empty overpriced lighter!
1	Wasn’t even the product described in description! This was my second time ordering the same item and it wasn’t right this time either. Save your time and buy somewhere else
1	I never ordered this nor received this.
1	Super disappointed that i ordered and never receive this product, had to end up canceling because it took over 3 weeks to even be shipped. Wont buy again from this vendor.
1	Came with no wrapping or protection of ANY kind, now dented and came apart! This has never happened before.
1	I will be sending this item back. I bought the 2XL after reading reviews and the cups on the top are smaller than a training bra and I can’t get the top to clasps at all. I’m a 36 C and there is absolutely no way this would fit.
1	These kept falling apart, returned for full refund. The plastic handle reinforcements kept falling out before I could even get these together and into my shelves
1	Too wide for sedan seats. We can't even use it because it covers seat belt buckle. I thought about returning the 2 I bought but I didn't.
1	Newborn size is far too big to be a newborn size. I ordered size newborn but when it arrived the tag says 0-3 mo, and it’s much bigger than my other 0-3 month clothes, it’s closer to a 3-6 month onesie.
1	No need to review, Amazon sells the device, but some apps they advertise will not work. What good is a product Amazon if it's only good for what Amazon sponsors at additional costs of course. Good advice don't buy an Amazon Fire Tablet, purchase a Kindle for your reading pleasure.
1	Never got the product. They offered a full refund for it.
1	iPad it’s perfectly in the case. Does not stay connected to iPad via Bluetooth have to keep reconnecting. Then the iPad makes a second connection for it. Have to keep turning off and back on to connect. It’s quite annoying. Regret this purchase.
1	I ordered these pillow cases and it would have been a great buy IF I would have received both of my pillowcases that it states it comes with!
1	Did not fit according to size. Too small.
1	Not sure why these are any different that the ones I buy at the store but my dog was able to chew the entire thing down in one day but the ones from the store last months.
1	Fabric was pure polyester, not good for infants. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known.
1	Product did not work w/ iPhone 8 Plus
1	Does not stick!! Popped off my note 9 after a couple of days. I followed the installation instructions. I wish I would have read other reviews before I wasted money on these.
1	Terrible. Not curved on sides. Does not adhere to edges. Doesn't work with cases due too non-curved sides. No way all these positive reviews are real purchasers of this product. Save your money.
1	Ordered a fan and received supplement pills.
1	Cheap made product! Bought to replace the newer nozzle on gas containers. One of the nozzles broke in half while pouring gas,luckily engine was cold. The second one the gasket failed. Find a different maker, made with cheap,thin plastic. Waste of money !
1	Not working with my computer. Will return. It is probably me. Will try one more computer.
1	Make sure to make sure your nail polish bottles will fit
1	Didn't even have this installed a month and the relay already failed. Was not exposed to moisture and somehow corroded causing my light bar to not work. Not too happy about it.
1	It's pretty difficult and the machine is complicated
1	I always use this product and love it. I’ve been ordering it for a long time. However, this most recent time I received two bottles and it was not the OGX conditioner in the bottle! Someone had clearly replaced it with a cheaper thick heavy conditioner, and I tried it in my hair and it was awful! It was so sticky and hard to wash out and my hair looked horrible afterwards. I had to throw it all away. Amazon sent me a replacement but it it’s concerning that this would happen. I’m not sure if I can ever trust ordering this from amazon again!
1	A pain in the a** to get the mounting brackets on and tight. And then still had to bend and pry the brackets to get the light bar to fit. Havent wired it up completely, I hope its atleast bright. So far sub par for the price. Light got moisture in the lens the first time it rained. Worthless
1	Very shallow. Advertises other things can be cleaned with it but reality is it’s way too shallow to fit anything in except phone. Had to take phone out of case. Disappointing. Wouldn’t waste your money on it. Would have been nice if glasses fit in it.
1	it is advertised to get rid of cigarette odors did not do what I needed still smells like smoke
1	It was basically a travel size and it did not mention this in the description. Way too tiny to use on a daily basis or even for traveling.
1	These worked for a few days, now whenever I try to use one my iPhone 6 says "accessory not supported"
1	This might be a good book if your in your 60s and above. It did nothing for my husband and I.
1	I ordered from Amazon because the only 5oz cups locally seem to be child oriented and not for an adult bathroom. Ha! My dixie cups have riddles on them and are as cartoonish as the ones I could have bought down the street. I'm throwing them out and getting a hard plastic cup. So mean to send something other than was pictured!!!
1	It is plastic . and it broke.
1	Very cheap looking. Thin pages and messy illustrations. Definitely not what I would choose to read to my class. Big disappointment.
1	Don't plan on ever taking these down. They will peel the paint from your walls and leave black adhesive.
1	Cheaply made would not buy
1	Hard to get to connect to charge
1	The grip bits are the hand portion of the glove we're falling off left and right. I'm not exactly sure why but it was probably after about 10 hours of use is when I really noticed it and began to slide my hands easier.
1	To short, material is hard.
1	Item wasn't delivered and no refund given
1	I bought this for the wireless charging capability. I was disappointed that when using wireless charging, it will charge for a few minutes and then it stops charging. You have to continuously check on it to make sure the charging has not shut off. I bought three of these. One for myself and two for gifts. Then I ordered a forth one for another gift. All four have a the same problem. I would not buy again.
1	If you buy one of these, be sure and get the one with the shatter proof insert. I got one with the glass insert which developed a crack after not more than a dozen uses!
1	These are easy to apply, but taking off the other side of the film is not. I put nails on at night and they already starting falling off the next afternoon. These aren’t for long time use
1	My remote just stopped moving. It will allow me to scroll thru but the dot never moves. Help!
1	Within a couple of weeks the center of the futon was sagging, and by the 2 month mark was completely flat in the middle, even with regular rotation. Could not sleep on it without rolling into the center. Worst futon mattress I've ever had, and no returns.
1	I took this as directed before getting a ride to the airport. I knew I would be in the back of the car on the drive. I started getting nauseous in the car (just like I usually do). Then on our flight, I got so overly nauseous to the point that I thought I was going to throw up. I know the exact symptoms -- first I start getting sweaty so I told my husband that I wasn't feeling well. I started to panic because I could see out of the window how high in the air we still were. He gave me a plastic bag just in case. I will never rely on this product again. While we were away, I went and bought the regular Dramamine that I had always relied on. It did the trick. I'm throwing this one that I got on Amazon in the garbage. I always love everything that I buy from Amazon so this is a definite first!
1	Shorted out my psu faulty on arrival. Smells like burning plastic
1	These will not stay on my son’s wall. They are currently falling off every time we turn around and will inevitably have to be thrown away.
1	Both batteries do not stay charged longer than a couple hours
1	I did not receive my item.
1	Item was never received
1	Stopped working after about a year. Slow wifi, did copious amount of troubleshooting to rectify the issue. All to no avail.
1	Nice product but does not have door hangers so we can't hang it.
1	Didn't work for me and I have dogs so I know that there was dog hair in there, lol.
1	I wish I could do half a star. I suffer from chronic neck and back pain and wanted to invest in something to relieve the pain. After reading on the different massagers, i settled on this one. My meds had worn off at 2am and the pain work me up. I decided to try the massager to get some relief until the next round of meds kicked in. I’m SUPER DISAPPOINTED! This worked for all of 30 seconds and then the nodes stopped working and the heat turned off. Seriously! Now stuck waiting in pain until meds kick in. I will be returning this item ASAP. Thanks for nothing!
1	I bought this set as a standby in case I ran out of ink. Unfortunately when I needed to replace them, the colored ink lights kept on blinking even after I made sure it was put in correctly. I was not able to print any of my documents.. This was he first tie I had problem with refilled ink.
1	Useless, basically its like a kazoo for your nose, does not alleviate snoring at all, if anything it made by nose feel sore the morning after, and is easily clogged if you have sinus issues.
1	Definitely buy the camera. Just the camera. Then get accessories that are worthy of the camera. Most of the accessories in this package are cheaply made and embarrassing to have been included the package. My mistake. Love the camera.
1	Fits too small and the material breaks easily
1	Difficult to get in and out of it. Too many handles and the zipper ids way smaller than the purse.
1	Only were able to use 3. The rest had holes in them.
1	Never received item.
1	Never received the product
1	DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It doesn't work at all. Missed the window to return it. Waste of Money. Junk
1	Didn’t like flavour and didn’t mix-up/dissolve well.
1	Received the old version of this “new and improved” shusher. I specifically bought this to get the version in grey that has raised buttons and a twist off bottom for ease in changing batteries and I received another one just like the one I had before. Very very misleading. Not happy at all. Now I have to take time out of my day and return an item that I thought was something else. i would order again but fear the same thing would happen.
1	The tire developed a crack after only 2 months of relatively light use.
1	All of the belts are very cute but once you start moving around while wearing them they come open and fall off. The links on the black belt completely fell off the belt. :(
1	I ordered the Hot Mama pickles and they sent me Sour Sis. I had bought them for my husband for his birthday. By the time his birthday arrived and he opened them it was too late to return. Now I'm out all that money for pickles he won't even eat!! NOT happy!!!
1	I had it on PC mode, and the adapter was like bugged. For example, the buttons wouldnt be touched at all on the gamecube controller, but on the PC it was reading it as all the buttons were being touched at the same time. And it's not my gamecube controllers doing that because when I used it on my wii, my gamecube controller works perfectly fine. Don't buy this adapter for PC.
1	They look good and have a cool style, but not very bright and very sensitive to current draw on the circuit from other items such as vacuum cleaners. These are a no name brand from what I can tell and 1 of the glass balls broke off from the base after installation. I will be returning my order and going back to 60w traditional bulbs.
1	These literally suck. I bought numerous ones and none of them work past 2 times
1	this company treat there costumers like shit , i ordered a GOLD stand , and just received ROSE GOLD , ARE YOU SERIOUS?!
1	I drink tea constantly, and one of my favorites is by this company. This tea, however, is disgusting and totally undrinkable to me. I am so sorry that I wasted my money, and if I could I would give in no stars.
1	The item was said to have been delivered Friday and was not delivered. The shipping address was correct and payment information correct but the tracking information was wrong or it was never actually shipped.
1	I was really excited about it but it was a broken!!!!!
1	I was worried when a few 1 star reviews mentioned a clicking noise. Turns out I was right to be worried. The clicking noise is loud and can not be mended without opening the fan, which I wouldn't recommend unless you want to ever return the fan. Sounds like something was made too long and hitting something constantly. I returned it to get another one to see if the issue was just the first fan. Wrong. Both did it. I do not recommend this at all.
1	Got these a few days ago and for $90 I could be a lot happier with them. First of all there's no point having the open toe bcz my toes barely show thru the "peep," maybe a scrap of toenail. I tried to push my toes forward a little bit (bcz w/o them showing a little there's an empty opening & it looks like my toes were amputated. Either make the opening big enough to show some toe or make a closed toe shoe.) But it was difficult bcz the shoes are rather narrow. Finally I got some toe poking thru the opening on both shoes but more on the right than the left. The left shoe is more narrow than the right shoe (not bcz my left foot is slightly bigger than my right, in fact, my left foot is slightly smaller than my right) but I figure maybe I can stretch and widen the left sandal a bit. On the weirder side, the left shoe is tighter but the strap around the back is too loose and slips down my heel. Right foot, the strap fits fine, stays up, and the shoe is wide enough. My conclusion? Somebody owes me $45 or a new left shoe. Not sure if I'll try to deal with it or send them back. I have to get ready to move in a couple of weeks and don't need the hassle of an Amazon return right now. I'm not sure how the leather will hold up as far as scuffing goes. I read all the reviews before buying these and no one said anything about how easily they get scuffed or not. I will say this, if the left sandal fit like the the right one I'd be in hog heaven and completely happy. Even with the toe issue. It stinks cuz I really like these shoes...this shoe, not sure what I'll do at this time. Update: I walked around in the shoes a little trying to decide if I should keep them or not and, like some other reviewers said, I found they dug into the tops of my toes. So I sent them back, too many negatives all around. It took the seller two weeks to issue my refund and only after I complained when 11 or 12 days went by and still no refund. Then they docked my refund almost $6 for return shipping even though Amazon gave me a prepaid return shipping label. So they found a way to make some money off me after all --steal it.
1	Never worked.... no help in getting it fixed or replaced
1	don’t buy this piece of shit. the joysticks will stop staying straight up making any game you play beer off in whatever direction gravity decides to take you. wish i could get my money back. if i could give 0 stars i would.
1	The color is already fading
1	I never got a DRUM ERROR where ALL SYSTEMS FAIL TO PRINT on my prior Toner. Now, I put this one in and it fails.
1	This was my child's favorite toy she got for Christmas... for 3 weeks. Then it broke in half. She is 3.5 and a confident walker, so this is not an issue of undue pressure on the cart. The legs snapped in half. Same spot and issue as almost every other complaint. It is not worth the money saved when it is only used for 3 weeks. Either don't get a shopping cart or splurge on a better quality one. Just don't waste your money on this one!
1	WAY TOO SWEET! It tasted like straight sugar. Would not buy again
1	This battery with 4.5 stars. But it doesn’t work, not charging at all. Laptop has black screen with battery icon for hours. Do not by this battery with fake reviews
1	This part has scratches all over it!
1	I followed the directions exactly and only one of the ten I got got some green leaves then quickly died.
1	This lamp is a piece of crap. It has very poor workmanship &/or materials because all it does it flicker constantly. At first it was only on one setting but after a day or so it became all settings. Really wish I wouldn’t have bought this. I would rather have bought something uglier that actually works. Instead I have to add to the landfill 👎
1	I knew this was a fake for only $3 but I ordered it at the end of Oct 2018 and it’s early Mar 2019 and it still hasn’t come in. I just wanted to see if this was anything like the real one but when I never get it, this is rediculous.
1	I was supposed to receive two boxes and only received one. Amazon what is wrong with the packaging department? That huge envelope for one box? Amazon is getting worse with product quality.
1	Its easy to install but I wouldn't buy it again. The temper glass won't completely stick to my phone. I have to keep pushing down on it so it can stick but it doesn't. I'm not very happy with my purchase.
1	It’s been one month and only the short cord works. The other two read “this accessory my not be supported” when i plug them in, then refuse to charge. Anything. I would avoid.
1	If I could give NEGATIVE stars, I would! I purchased this for a week long trip to France and it didn’t even make it through the WEEK! The lightning end bent and broke off! Also, before it broke, the adapter only worked sporadically!!! JUNK! Don’t waste your money!!!!
1	I will not use it. It is too big for what I want it for.
1	When I received the ring was missing some “diamonds” the opal was crooked, and looked smashed. Had to reorder it.
1	Product title says that you will get 40, but I only got a box of 20.
1	I bought this DVD drive for playing DVDs for work purposes. It doesn't work. I put the DVD in, go to My Computer to open it, and the DVD just spins endlessly without opening. This has happened with six different DVDs now, all from different sources, so it is not the DVD causing the problem. As Windows told me in the error message that popped up: "The last device you connected to your computer via USB malfunctioned." No kidding. A waste of $30. Don't buy this product.
1	The slowest charging chord in the world. Don’t buy it it will take 4 hours to charge your phone.
1	Everything is wrong, not fun and highly overpriced
1	I hate to be that person but this is honestly really annoying as a customer. I never got a chance to use these because I had to cancel the order I ordered over $35 worth of stuff on April 4th JUST to get these with 1 day delivery (which really is 2 days depending on what time you order) because I really needed these now and they only carry them online. Then I find out they wont be delivered until April 13th so not only are they not coming in the 1-2 days promised, its going to take them over a whole week to get here. I don't understand why these are on prime with a quick delivery date and further more I don't get why you are tricking people into ordering more stuff to get it to come quicker if its not going to be honored anyways. The regular prime shipping times aren't even honored. If you're ordering these don't expect them to come quick despite them being on prime/free 1-day
1	Came melted with the wrappers stuck to the candy. Had to throw it out. A total mess. No packing insulation in the shopping box.
1	This clock is not durable- it is like a toy & it is not user easy- I do not understand what it is doing- setting it was like a guessing game.
1	It’s difficult to position the nail just right for it to be illuminated and trimmed. Forget trying this item to illuminate your dogs nails if your dog has black nails, you can’t see anything through black nails. Don’t waste your money.
1	I really do not like planner, I don't understand what it wants from me. It's very frustrating. I wish I could return it.
1	Item received was broken, with product leaking out and all over the jar.
1	Every single piece of metal on this rusted after the first rain, including all the screws. I had to paint the flat metal piece because it looked so bad. Buy something else.
1	Broke after first two uses. Definitely not worth it
1	Broke in less than a week... Could not even return it...
1	This fell apart as I was installing it. Cheap material!
1	This looked like such an adorable item! It arrived and it was missing one of the headlights, and the wheels had fallen off. Since it was so cute, I really wanted this to work for my daughter! I had tried to snap the wheels back in place, but that did not work, and more pieces started falling off. I need a refund on this item asap.
1	At first the fan was great, very quiet. we have had it for just over a year now. recently two of the three fans quit working. we dont use it much so we were surprised to see it acting up. We also never received a remote control as advertised
1	Sucks after wash, cold water low heat
1	I can’t write a proper review because the package I received was empty. Literally.
1	I have a feeling I'm going to love it, but it is missing one of the connector parts. :(
1	The grabber is longer, which is nice. Although it did not have much of a grip on the grabber end...
1	It has a great feel to it, but it chips easily. I have had it for a month now, and I am already looking for a different cover out there.
1	I got 3 large sticks just like the last reviewer. Nothing like the picture. They are also moldy. When I opened the package I thought I had received 3 chunks of filthy concrete.
1	Awful. Stopped working after 5 weeks.
1	When I print in Black only, it is impossible to read, it is so light. I have to print in color
1	These plants were INFESTED with worms and snails! I mean tons of worms floating when I did the recommended quarantine soak. I am starting a planted aquarium for the first time and emailed the seller. He said the snails are beneficial and told me to do some research! I’m disgusted. I did do research and found the worms are a result of poor conditions in the tank...WORST customer service ever! And I have to do all this work to get the infestation out of my plants! Thankfully I did not put them in my tank, they are going in the trash. What a waste of my time and money. DO NOT BUY!
1	Buy this if you want toast that is half cooked, but the half that is cooked is burned. This product, set to the lowest setting, burns the outside of frozen waffles while the inside remains cold. I didn't even know that was possible. Also, standard-size bread does not fit in the slots. So be prepared to hover around this thing to stop it early AND to turn the bread around to cook both ends. Just a poorly-designed product. I had an old $6 toaster that did great for many years. I hoped this would be like that (but obviously more expensive). It was not.
1	DON'T purchase candles or BREAKABLE items from Amazon. They don't bubble wrap or protect products. You pay high shipping fee, wait long periods and receive BROKEN products. DO NOT TRUST AMAZON..YOU'VE BEEN WARNED !!
1	Do not buy this item from this company. The item came without the proper cuts in the wristband, and when I actually tried to fix it the material just turned to crap. One star is too high but had to mark it with one
1	Don't waste your money to buy this, the mouse can't leave the mouse pad for 10 seconds, otherwise it will automatically power off, and my mouse pad rgb broken within three months.
1	This eyeglasses smells soooo bad. Smell nasty chemical. I would have kept it even if it didn't work for me as other people claimed. I washed them with soap and warm water many times, chemical smell wont go away, so it made me decide to return them.
1	They shipped brown sipper pulls.
1	Overall, great purchase. I had been looking for a while for a band decently priced for the gear fit 2 pro. Comfort is great, no hair snags yet. The edges are clean. I have only had for one week but the finish is holding up nicely. Wear every day for the most part, most of the day. Great purchase, as there were no reviews wanted to provide something for others. *** UPDATE 6 WEEKS later, product broke, band slipped out of watch connection. Started to fade shortly after this review. Overall don't waste your money, unless you're looking for a band that will last you about 2-3 months
1	Product did not work, it chewed up my tapes, it was cheaply made, it did not transfer anything to the flash drives (I tried with a couple) I was so hopeful to be able to copy my old tapes to mp3. It’s like the saying too good to be true. I hope they improve the product and actually make it work as advertised. If they made it work I’d gladly purchase again even at a higher price.
1	Tried two shirts and a sweater. The shirts both had holes torn in them while being very gentle. The heavy knit sweater looks better. Would not buy again.
1	The watch is beautiful but it is not working
1	I was extremely disappointed to find that a good majority of the vitamins inside the packaging were broken and crumbled. Basically half of the vitamins needed to be thrown away.
1	I received the product with the wrinkled packaging that looks old and unused for a long time. It confirmed my suspicion as I opened up the supposedly "Wet" cleaner, and it being totally dry. I tried to apply the screen protector, however, it didn't stick good even with the appropriate amount of pressure. The sides especially won't stick into the phone. It easily peeled off as I took it off. For me, even though the price is low, it's still not worth the purchase.
1	Followed the instructions for starting off - made it about 3 days and could no longer stand the intense hunger this leaves you with! Not only that, but if you are going to try to stick it out, one can only lasts about 4 days. You’ll need about two cans a week. IF IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE - IT PROBABLY IS! Believe it for this.
1	very distorted. cannot use
1	I received the bulbs and hooked them up and no light. Contacted the company and they were responsive. They asked for a cut wire picture which I supplied and they said once they got the picture they would send a new set. Over a month since last email and have not heard back and have not received replacements
1	Works for about 2-3 min before reporting error on iPhone.
1	If you have bigger boobs all it’s going to do is give your boobs creepy wrinkly looking mess
1	Spilled everywhere and all over my non returnable dog food
1	I ordered lemon-lime tootsie pops, the package label also said so but I received lemon tootsie pops instead!
1	The aluminum on the back rest on this chair bent the second time I sat in it. It was useless after that. It is not a heavy duty chair. I would not buy this chair.
1	Shrunk 1 inch in width and 2 inches in length after washing
1	This product sucked and did not work properly. It had awful static and since using it my phone is broken and I cant hear people talking and they can’t hear me.
1	Way too small I will be returning these. They are more for an infant or a doll.
1	Worked for just long enough to last through the warranty then completely failed. No longer charging any type of Apple products. Buy a different product
1	Item arrived with cap broken, 50% gone/dumped all over the box. Box leaked all over me and stained my shirt and pants
1	I waited a month and the mattress was delivered to the wrong address. The seller told me they would send another but I couldn’t get them to respond after that point. I had to file a claim with amazon to get a refund. Don’t recommend this seller.
1	How Sway? Why is this tool even available for sale and it doesn't work AT ALL? Don't waste your money.
1	It’s very short - not nearly as long as pictured. Does not fit as it should - improper sizing on vendor’s part.
1	Item was delivered to wrong address. I was provided a photo of the item by the delivery person. It was in front of someone else’s door. Item has not been received and there doesn’t appear to be a way to contact Amazon about it.
1	Never received the item. The Ring and the Power adapter were supposed to be used in a 2nd home. Just opened the box and only received the Ring. No Adapter. Rip off. Got charged for both.
1	Product broke within the first week of using it. Cheaply made, Highly do not recommend. Very disappointed.
1	Very hard to keep synced to my device and the left earbud failed after the second day.
1	Not worth the money! Stop working after a month
1	Used for a while, broken quality problems
1	The product I received was not what I ordered. I ordered the camo bags and got just black ones. WHY?
1	I have reordered this item twice and it keeps coming as ONE single pack, not FOUR. I paid for FOUR packs and only got ONE pack. Also, the first pack came and was worn out, had been opened before and clearly looked old. DO NOT order from this vendor!! Now I have to try to get a refund.
1	Disappointed with the quality. To late to send it back.
1	Looks nice but it was missing a big piece. What’s more frustrating is that I am now going to have to wait a month for the replacement. I’m just going to return it and get my money back. Really upset.
1	Arrived late, and when I returned it I never got my money back. Good book but bad service.
1	Paper thin and worthless
1	POOR Quality! Cover ripped, 1/3 of the book is water damaged. It was represented as “very good quality”, but there is no way this could be considered anything above poor or unacceptable condition
1	Did not receive item as advertised. Received plastic jug not air tight can. When issue was brought up with seller, seller response was -- "I apologize if you received our newest packaging before our image change. Both our plastic metal hybrid can and plastic jug both contain an air tight packaging! Please contact me if you have any questions." No further efforts made to remedy the situation.
1	The tubes holding the light to the battery boxes broke out of the brass box when just taking them out of the packing. The boxes did not mount in good position for lighting the picture (too high and far away for the picture). The remote only works 10% of the time. Too expensive to be this poorly made.
1	The foam adhesives look so old and raggedy. Nothing like the pictures. Like its been sitting in storage for so long or they were previously used. I would return it but its not worth it. Will not be ordering this again. Very disappointed.
1	Not happy its not the print I ordered and it sent me a boy print I ordered 2 both came in boy prints and im not happy but they are good they don't leak and my infant loves these
1	My boxes must have been defective, they do not want to burn correctly, only half of it will light and burn. They hardly crackle. I have been using duraflame for the past three years and this was a bad batch.
1	It barely spits water
1	2 out of 6 don’t work. 2 months later 2 more quit working on USB ports. Don’t waste money
1	Did not work as a band replacement for my Fitbit Surge...the top band did not slide on the entire way.
1	Used to charge a fence to keep goats and pigs in. Stopped working after 3 months. Checked power to battery. That was good. So it was charging. But power was not getting to the terminals.
1	Drivers side mat has become hardened, such that the sides have permanently warped up and won’t lay flat, and shifts around now because of it. I have to buy a new mat and only got 6 months maybe, out of it. To me, that’s not a good product for your money. To the seller: Is there some kind of warranty on this??
1	Very small almost too small but quality
1	Cheap, flimsy fabric. Didn’t even come complete, had to send it back.
1	This product doesn't work. My iPhone is too heavy for the dash mount and caused the entire thing to fall over. That caused both magnetic discs to stick together. So it is useless now. Don't buy!
1	Ummm, no.....the ends of the rings are sharp, once you open the ring a little to put it in it's a major pain in the *** to squeeze it back closed, and the color on the colored ones is like a film of some sort that peels off (while I am wearing it!) if I wear it for more than about 24 hours (this was very embarrassing!). The one, and only one, plus for them is no skin reaction of any kind. Hence the 1 star. So again, NO....sorry, don't waste your time or money unless of course you like doing that sort of thing (NOT!).
1	Its a piece of junk, picture shown looks cute. And to make matters worse it came with the plastic opened and the spinner is not even there. Don't waste $19.00 on this junk!
1	UPDATE: Now they all stopped working. And as usual, seller is completely unresponsive. Expensive garbage. Lifetime warranty, my a**. Product SEEMS pretty well put together, but after 2 weeks, one of the 3ft cables stopped working. The seller's website is non-working, and all emails sent asking for a replacement have gone unanswered. Unless you're willing to live with 50% of the cables going bad in a short amount if time and NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT, I'd choose something else.
1	They just fit awkward and looked weird
1	This case the inner part cracks and i had to be replaced and now mine is cracked
1	It was not sturdy at all!!
1	Very flimsy and not full coverage. Didn't even use
1	The boot was way to stiff and uncomfortable.
1	Ends don't come together to allow hairs to be gripped. Don't waste your money on these. I ended up throwing them away.
1	Gillette Mac 3 is much better , so sorry I bought this one... Bad purchase....
1	Just received these and one is broken. I went to file a return, and they don’t replace it accept returns!!!!! So disappointed!
1	When I purchased this I didn't realize there were two different formulas. I have been using the natural for years and been very happy with it. When I started using this formulation it would just run off an apple leaving very little to rub with. It is very watery and did not remove the wax. Then I realized my mistake. I am going back to the natural and dumping the organic.
1	Cheap plastic...don't waste your money.
1	I have no issue with product, I have been using it a long time. However the package was left on my stoop with plastic poorly containing broken box and burst bottle with soapy substance spilling out on and soaking into wood flooring. Very disappointing to say the least. For a company who deals with shipping ordered products to customers careful packaging it upmost important when shipping liquids. As a result unable to give even one star especially considering the length of time it took to clean up the mess caused by shipping. Unable to submit without a star.........but not deserving.
1	I had my pull start on my motor for all of 3 pulls until it wore through the plastic gromet and snapped the first cord. Then the tank on the recoil spring broke which meant I had to take the whole spring out rebend it then coil it back up. Then the cord had to snap again because of rubbing on the metal. Then after that when I took the pull started off I saw that one the posts which holds the springs and ratchet pawls had snapped off. Such a pain. Not even worth the 2 dollars they pay to make it in china. Your better off starting your motor with a drill.
1	It's very cheap products...
1	Awful product. It changes and appears like a chemical solution after using for couple of days. This product doesn't seem authentic. Please don't waste your money.
1	not worth the cost - I see no results
1	Will not charge more the 2 items. I cannot charge by Galaxy note 8 and 2 iPads at once or any 2 type c chargers. The charger keeps turning on and off.
1	Received a defected frame.
1	This pen is sucks!!! It show ink. But don’t work.. what kind of shit is this. Basically is trash. Thank you.
1	I ordered what I thought was a new gauge, instead I got one poor beaten up gauge. With no ability to return it. I am very angry.
1	The cover was used, scratched and dirty.
1	Cheap and keeps breaking
1	I wrote a review that was deleted. So, here's another attempt. This is such a wonderful product. Buy as many as you can, and then buy some more for gifts. You will be ecstatic.
1	I never received them. I was reimbursed because I was told my package was lost.
1	This is hard as stone! If you want to deform your foot, this is what you buy! I’ll return this (hope I still can).
1	The upper cover (used to protect the screen) does its job properly and it grabs itself firmly to the cover of the screen. But the bottom cover is loose around one corner. It's somewhat dangerous because if you grab the Mac by that part and the bottom cover tears off from that corner, you might drop the Mac. I'll have to get another case.
1	Not as described at all. Poor quality.
1	Horrible product. I bought this product for a party. When I got it, it was damaged. So they sent me a replacement one. When I received the replacement one that one was broke as well. So I just sent both back and wanted my refund.
1	Did not work at all , returning .
1	This item was purchased in 2017 and failed in early 2019. That may not seem like a problem except that it was used in our Florida home that is only used four (4) months of the year. Junk!!!!
1	Acetone and nail polish thinner are two different things. This product is 100% acetone! Basically it’s overpriced nail polish remover. Adding acetone will thin your nail polish yes, but it will also change the color of the nail polish, destroy the structure, and when applied on the nail will damage the nail structure over period of time. If you’re a fan of expensive nail polishes stay away from this product! I’ve ruined two bottles of my favorite nail polish before I realized that it was 100% acetone!
1	Purchased a number of these for our two cats, both in the cranberry color and in white. Bowl is a good size/weight and cut-out handle is very functional. Unfortunately, however, the glazed finish is EXTREMELY thin and chips off at the slightest touch. Despite handling and hand washing with care, all bowls had multiple chips in the finish within days of first use. Too bad - this would be a very good product except for the poor quality of the finish. Very disappointing.
1	it looks really cheap. the material is really rough to the touch. thread lines are very obvious. looks like dollar store stuff!
1	Did not help me fall asleep :(
1	Wonky. one of the bars fell off. Instructions are terrible and I ended up having to take one the bars off when putting it over the toilet because it blocks the water hose from the wall to toilet. Returned it because it was badly designed.
1	I had to throw this away. I really wanted to like it and tried everything! I added cheese and butter, broiled it, toasted it, even with bacon added to the cheese and butter, it was still spongy and inedible.
1	Not really sure what to say. Was expecting a decent sized toy. After opening it and setting it up, it was a major disappointment. Super small everything. The picture in the box is very misleading and if I could give it ZERO stars I would. Package says 3 and up. My normal sized 3 year old towers over this thing.
1	Don’t buy. One of the cables quit working after one day.
1	i had an issue with item and it was never resolved and contacted seller by there customer service and they said they would resolve but never did and then blocked me so i couldn't send them any other messages, very glad i ordered through amazon prime so it can be resolved this way
1	Didn't hold a light little metal cross on my bedroom wall when it fell off, I said forget it I tried rolling the tape off carefully it took the paint off my wall. NEVER AGAIN!
1	Purchased this two pack as I needed one bunny for each Grandsons basket! Only one grandson got a bunny the second was crushed to a blob! Used the one disposed of the other as it was too late too replace!
1	need to get a start and replant later. have not tried yet, hope seeds survive till i can work it. No instruction supplied, went on line for info.
1	One arm is falling off on day 2...
1	This product does not leave hardly any imprint and is totally gone once the cookies bake!!!! Wish I could get my money back! Do not buy this item!!!!! Again do not buy this item!!!
1	Horribly packaged! The Blush came broken in pieces and there’s no way to get a refund or replacement. So ridiculous
1	The voice is too low. The first one did not last more than 1 month, the second one i ordered has a very low sound.
1	Within a week they started to fall apart. Not leather more like plastic
1	Zipper Broke 30 days after use cannot even return! Bad purchase
1	I’ve only had this keychain for about two months and within the first two weeks the strings were coming apart and falling off. Wouldn’t buy unless your keys sit on a counter for show
1	I'm not one that needs to have bells and whistles on every toy I buy my granddaughter, but this was just not designed well. It's supposed to be a recycling truck - so you should be able to put things into it and dump them out. Not designed well.
1	This was a joke. It must be a toy.
1	Toy was annihilated within 10 minutes by my heavy chewer. Don’t waste your money on a toy that is definitely not tough or durable!
1	Just closed pool on Tuesday. Clasp that tightens rope around the pool cover broke today Friday. Clasp only lasted 3 days. Read some good reviews before I bought this pool cover. Guess I didn’t read enough of them.
1	Worked great at first. Stopped working after 6 months, with very little use and physically still like new
1	i wear medium so i order medium but wayyyyy to big so i just decided to give it away n order small size instead but unfortunately it looks like an extra large just waaaayyy too big
1	I tried to use this on the rug I ordered it for and I can’t. So I just threw the rug away and took the L
1	As soon as I put my life proof box on it it lifted up the edges Causing air bubbles
1	Can I give a 1/2 star?!?? The product was listed as new. I purchased and had it shipped directly to a friend as a gift. She received it and NOTHING was new about it, not even the box it came in! The box was clearly previously used as old shipping labels were torn off of it. The box also had a large tear in it. The actual item itself was rolled up and tied with two pieces of material and you could clearly see where it was ripped without ever unrolling the item. The carrying bag that comes with it was also dirty. The only good thing I can say is that when I called the company that shipped it, they were apologetic. The gentleman I spoke with quickly emailed a return label so it could be sent back and my money was refunded.
1	This did nothing for my skin, I might has well have used water. Couldn't feel or see any difference.
1	This product is really loud! This broke on day 2. The base came apart and no way to snap it back together. The part where the cable plugs in came apart from its housing. I used blue tape. Next day, one of the two small wires from the cable housing (inside product) came loose. Have since bought another one and it’s super quiet and no issues.
1	They are hard to get on and off
1	The product was damaged when I received it. The contents had leaked and dried to the outside of the bottle and you can see clear damage to the sticker indicating the liquid has leaked down the side of the bottle. Very dissatisfied. I am returning for a refund.
1	Did not deliver as pictured item. Received a knock off.
1	Not any better than what I was getting for free
1	This was to replace my broken band. One side of this one doesn't fit exactly right, so it has a gap in it.
1	Got sick from the product. Yall need to emphasize the importance of the ingredients. My body broke out in a rash from my face, arms, and legs. My body was trembling and had bad nausea with accompanied dizziness. I almost ran to the hospital before my husband cut me off from the product. I couldn't believe it but soon after quitting cold turkey. I felt better than I have since I started drinking it. Beware
1	This hat is kid sized. Had to give it away to a child.
1	Files corrupted within a day. Seems like I'm not the only one with that issue. Think carefully before you buy!
1	when you make a call the sound is bad
1	all pieces were not in package
1	Did not grow and can't return the mix . Please dont buy from them . Total waste of money !
1	Don't waste your hard earned money. It doesn't work. The thing came with a cable to connect the AUX connection only, which did not work. It had connections for digital and usb connections, so I ordered digital and usb cables. It still doesn't work. The only thing that works is an LED light.
1	I was expecting these magnets to have a firm grip on the side of my Fridge, but they slide to much. Also the clips are flimsy.
1	Horrible paper towels. I have a lot of dogs and I use them non stop for food and pee pee issues. When I wet the towel it was flat and fell apart. Bounty I can reuse over and over it is strong. This is like the towels you see at a cheap truck stop! The way Amazon customer service treated me when I complained was disgraceful. Kept me on hold for 10 mins while she ''checked'' ..... Tork you should NEVER be making these, I like your other towels but false advertising!!! Now I have to lug these 6 heavy towels to UPS. With a bad arm and hurt leg. Awful treatment all around. If I could give no stars I would. Money is not everything!!!!
1	Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage. Tried four different baits, nothing worked.
1	Terrible! Who can use an already melted candle?
1	We purchased a bumper for our first child that was thrown away during a renovation. This product is very hard to peel the adhesive tape off the apply. Would spend a few more dollars and get something higher quality.
1	Kiddo, who loves other Fiber One products AND anything cookies and cream, couldn't finish the bar because it was chalky. The crumbles stuck to teeth. We had to give away the rest of the box to homeless.
1	It’s cheaply made after only 1 month it tore off the buckle I would like my money back
1	The plastic lens doesn't accomplish optically what it sets out to do. The light isn't really placed usefully. Useless to me.
1	Material held o to wrinkles easily. Somehow washed it and aquired some type of clear stain I couldn’t get rid of. None of my other whites had this weird stain? Needless to say it’s in the garbage now.
1	Phone fell from 29 inches and destroyed phone. Case di nothing to protect it. Spend more money for a better product.
1	Product I received was completely different than the one I ordered.
1	Only one spark plug at a jacked up prove. Had to pay to return it.
1	Ordered this product waited a week and a half never received it. Delivery date kept getting pushed back. Which is sad never even received a tracking number. Amazon took care of me but wanted to warn others just Incase you order and don’t receive the product.
1	Probably one of the worst buys I have had on Amazon, usually if I like a product I would give it 5 star . It’s just been like 2 plus months and this product has stopped working . One of the worst products I have seen.
1	I used the fast patch to conceal a tennis ball sized hole in the wall, and it looks awful. I went by the book with the instructions, but the hole bulges and the tape lines are anything but subtle. I was steered wrong by the rave reviews. Also, 31 stickers were a rip. There is one large sticker and the rest are small to tiny. Stick with hole filler and wall screens. Totally bummed about this purchase.
1	I’ve used this product two times. The first it was really nice to sleep on and no air leaked, the second it deflated before we even laid on it to sleep. It’s too late to return it now or else I would. I do not recommend this product.
1	Not 6mm in length which I ordered. To small.
1	If I could give negative stars I would! DO NOT BUY!! Product is literally in a thick plastic capsule, VERY HARD TO SWALLOW, and I doubt it’s safe. The product is not FDA APPROVED. Literally says it right on the bottle. Amazon is going to get sued eventually for allowing such sellers to sell products such as this. I’m not even sure if the product inside the capsule is Vitamin C, it feels and taste like plastic. (I opened the capsule and tried to mix it in my water, but the little beads inside do not even dissolve, like I said MOST LIKELY PLASTIC)!!!!!!!
1	Not the same as photo online!
1	I understand the need for ads when the game is free. However, there are so many that it makes it impossible to even play. So this may actually be a great game but I guess I'll never know!
1	I've had this chair for less than 11 months and the screws holding the back of the chair broke. I called the company and they sent me a new back, unfortunately no hardware. When I called again and told them I needed the hardware and now a new bottom (since the screw was stuck in it) I received major attitude from a supervisor and was told to call Amazon. Amazon call center was gracious and immediately sent me a new chair. But, the new chair had a cracked plastic piece on the bottom and the holes for the screws to hold the arm rest on was messed up that now we are having to try to get the screw to fit. Bottom line....DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY! Not only do their products suck, so does their customer service. Go someplace else! I would have liked to given the company a minus star but the system wouldn't let me.
1	The Product is good but one only pair Arrive instead of 3 pairs.
1	I didn't even use it up to 30 minute before I had to recharge it each time I turned it on.....
1	I’ve ordered this twice and each time got the wrong bow. Don’t feel like going through the return again.
1	These are postcard stamps that the seller takes forever (pun intended) to mail. It was amazing though ... Once I tried to cancel for taking too long they shipped that day. Soooo incredibly irritated with this purchase.
1	Smells old. Not at alll like my original one when I first got it.
1	I through it was steel or hard plastic was not pleased
1	I’m sure the product is fine but the sale is deceiving. They say they will send you two, but you only get one. For $70 dollars when you can go Walgreens for $27.99 for one bottle.
1	Poorly made and cheap feeling. Was sent out with a broken snap, how was that missed?
1	Hard as a rock, could not use.
1	This is so stupid I thought it was something completely different! Waste of money!
1	I ordered a large size and when I received the gloves I could not place my hands in the gloves. I was very disappointed.
1	Two out of the three screen protectors were cracked
1	Trash all trash Amazon steals your money back product do not buy
1	I bought two of these to help with my carpal tunnel symptoms. The product measurement is supposed to be based on your wrist circumference. Based on my wrist circumference, a "Large" should have fit. I have large palms and these items were too tight to easily pull on and off; particularly considering I bought them for carpal tunnel. They were actually cramping my hand. I'm sure they'd be fine for someone with smaller hands. I have no issues with the product quality; just the sizing. There was a review mentioning this and I thought, "It's probably an isolated issue." I was wrong. It's not. Sooo...there's a fast $40 bucks down the toilet...and the last Futuro product I will buy ever just on principle.
1	I bought this with their promotion and my dog passed away within a week of taking it. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!
1	I ordered this TP over 3 months ago and it still has not shipped. This is ridiculous.
1	Not as advertised. By non stick they mean it'll stick every time. I put eggs in without oil and I had to dig them off the pan. A touch of cooking oil and the pan works fine. But that's not what I was looking fo
1	it worked great for a few months and then it suddenly stopped charging. it repeatedly bumps against the dock but never begins charging. the battery is now dead and it doesnt work anymore.
1	Returned product , it was destroyed in shipment
1	I planted it in the ground and it just dried up and died.
1	Put meat directly on tray after 2 hours still frozen. I put chicken breast directly on tray. Waisted my money. Guess if I want fast de-frost I have to use microwave.
1	Didn’t receive my item said it got delivered , but I never recieved it .
1	The headset stopped working after six months.
1	I ordered two of these with the exact same descriptions and logos. One was twice the size of the other. Not okay for my purposes.
1	broke getting pulled on by a 20lb puppy.
1	Worked for a few hours then would stop working and you'd have to unplug it from the wall and plug it in again. Just for it to stop working 10 minutes later.
1	DO NOT BUY! These caps are WAY too small for anyone who has hair.
1	They’re very stiff and the clip falls off with one use
1	I ordered these for my beach wedding. It is supposed to come with a PAIR, meaning two, one for each foot. When it arrived it had only one of the two in the package. I tried contacting the seller 2 weeks ago and still have not gotten a response.
1	I only printed one piece of paper that had very minimal color and a few black and white pieces and now I'm more than half empty of the tri color ink. Bought January 3rd 2019 and now almost empty. I've spent more on ink than what I originally paid for the printer.
1	I'm giving this only one star mainly for how it was shipped! It was send in an amazon box that would've packaged all of it nicely, but instead was rolled up in another package & then put in the box! The hat has a crease right in the front that we can't get out, & leaves it looking more like Peter Pan's hat! If I had for time, I would've sent it back, but now I'm trying to use an iron to get that crease out.
1	did nothing, was not scented lemon in the least. not even lemon colored, mine were blue.
1	I have not received today is 16th - was supposed t be here 15th
1	My chipmunks are still here
1	Not what I ordered. Not Bormioli Rocco glasses. FIVE of the 12 glasses were broken.
1	It is not working at all. Terrible product!
1	I wear my fitbit every day. Normal wear, desk job, run, nothing out of the ordinary. The band is extremely dirty and can't be cleaned. I tried cleaning it with everything and it's really dirty looking after only a month of wearing it.
1	Simple to assemble; just didn’t work
1	I wear a size 7 an 8 in thongs they barley covered the front part of my panties a waste of money
1	I have not received this product even though it says it was delivered.
1	It’s didn’t fit at all like this picture. It was horrible
1	The colors were pretty however one clipboard came without the top clip being attached fully to the board. I needed them for a gift the next day and Had no time to return them and shop for new ones so I was stuck with the broken clipboard.
1	Didn't move much dust in the keyboard or even just on the desk.
1	I decided to try this for my GERD after reading all those great reviews. I took two gels on an empty stomach as directed about 30 minutes before breakfast. After a few hours I became nauseous; this was followed by terrible flatulence, then diarrhea, then finally by the worst acid reflux I've suffered in over a decade. I have to wonder if this is even the same product reviewed! GARBAGE. Wish I could give minus-four stars.
1	The battery died will not change
1	came with all kinds of wrinkles in the paper.
1	You sent me a scratched up used unit. I hope it works
1	I installed this product,at first I saw flickering lights on my screen once in a while. Eventually the entire screen turned white i hope I can get my money back for this. it's clearly not good
1	Only worked for two months every time I used it it got burning hot and smelled like melting plastic while only airing up about 10 psi now it stopped working yesterday
1	This is very uncomfortable and doesn’t support your back like it states. It digs into your armpits.
1	Too right around the neck. Really for teens.
1	I literally received these yesterday, used twice today and it already has milk in it.... So disappointing and a waste of money!!
1	Credit cards stick out too far, and there's little room for any extra membership/rewards cards. Magnet is weak; wouldn't trust it with more than a few singles. You really have to force the cards in for some of the slots. I was really hoping I could replace my beat up wallet with this, but it's nothing like I was hoping and I'll probably just toss it out and keep using my old wallet. If you have 4 cards and an ID, sure, it might be sufficient. But for the rest of us in the real world, this thing is a waste of money.
1	Just purchased in March and it has since died so only worked for 6 months
1	Don't buy this. I bought this 2 weeks ago and it's already not working. A complete waste of money
1	Very poor quality. Our six year old son received on X-mas morning, by lunchtime everything but the ice cubes had broken. Bought a better quality whoopie cushion at the dollar store.
1	1st time using this brand and definitely the last. Both tests came out invalid and were completely useless. Went and bought another well known brand and got results within seconds.
1	Did not work. The Ortho product is 100 times better
1	Just other reviewers mentioned, I got breakouts on my chin and forehead. Shea butter is one of its ingredients and this is not good for sensitive skin though it can be moisturizing for the body not for sensitive face.
1	Never recieved this item and it took over a month to get
1	Used only once and it is falling apart and already has a hole....
1	I ordered a case for an Iphone 6 and I got a 6s. I need a case for a 6
1	The chord either was defective or not compatible with our PC and monitor. There is little help provided from the manufacturer
1	Broke the first time my son turned it on.
1	Piece of garbage tightened it up to start stretching and the joint broke first turn. Wasn’t going crazy on it as soon as a little pressure got on the shoe it broke. Tried the second one and the same happened. Don’t waste your time or money.
1	Huge disappointment that caused nothing but grievances. This TV only lasted 21 days. This Lemon TV quit showing a display out of the blue the day before Christmas Eve! What timing! Guess what I did for Christmas? Not surprised this TV is discontinued. It's a glorified paperweight. Element should stick with making cardboard boxes. I never write reviews but this was a special case. I would avoid buying any Televisions through Amazon. Period. Avoid the hassle and get a name brand TV like a Sony or Samsung. The few extra bucks is worth the peace of mind. Today as I write this, UPS just tried to deliver the same TV I sent out to return for a refund. Didn't bother ringing the door bell with the return label on Tuesday. Welcome to the Holiday Season. Incompetence with both Amazon and UPS. Now I'm going to have to wait probably another week for my refund. If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Buy cheap, get cheap. Just buy a Sony. Don't buy a TV with less than a 4-Star rating and less than 200 reviews. Rule of thumb. P.S. Android is better. Happy New Year!
1	They sent me the wrong product. I tried to return or replace and the policy is no returns. There is no option to even contact the seller. Nordic Naturals better fix this
1	The string snapped on my tent after one use
1	I only had this collar for three months and it broke. Luckily, it happened in my backyard and not when I was walking my dog in the street. This collar is not durable or strong enough for a large dog. I have a golden lab crossbreed. I cannot rate it highly based on my experience.
1	Super flimsy. Not appropriate for a larger dog. My german shorthair pointer was able to get out multiple times, even with zip tying and using carabiners. Broke out once and ripped open his stomach area. Would not suggest for a larger dog. Only for a small dog to have a bigger kennel space.
1	These came in a huge box with other things that were glass!! The box was so big this poor little bottle just went from one place to the next in that huge box!! I’m surprised they weren’t broken all to pieces. Not to mention there was a gaping hole where the tape didn’t even catch !! I could stick my hand inside the box while it was taped!!
1	The product that was sent was the wrong item. I will try and reorder the right one.
1	Just no! This SPF runs into your eyes and makes them burn. There is a whitish cast to it as well. Hard pass on this.
1	Disappointed in this charger. Upon removing it from the package it did not fit snug into the charging port. Very loose fit and often is not charging my phone.
1	**update** My Janome hates this bobbin thread. :0( thought it was just my machine that hated this thread but I gave the thread to a friend who has a Brother machine. Her machine hated it too. This bobbin thread is cheap & constantly broke...super frustrating! do yourself a favor and don't buy this thread!
1	I ordered three separate orders from this seller, and NONE of my orders arrived. BUY ELSEWHERE.
1	The shoes are super cute. I love the design. However they are very poorly constructed with the cheapest materials that I have ever felt on a "shoe". Because of this they are VERY uncomfortable. I had to put memory foam insoles in them, bandaids on the inside of the back of them, which has made a difference. But there is still a section that is poking the top of my left foot. Not sure what to do about that. Overall, I love the look but the feel and construction are horrible. Won't be buying them again.
1	What to do will it work hope you can figure it out
1	It’s horrible. It takes ages to load even the most simple thing like settings, the touch screen won’t swipe. And the keyboard doesn’t type and the mouse doesn’t work. Horrible product would never recommend just save up for a real device.
1	It's warm, I like the design, but after a couple of washes the pocket stitching is falling apart. This is a VERY cheaply made product and lasts about a month before it starts falling apart.
1	The item overheated here and it has a very annoying noise. It's not worth it. Better to pay more for a original one. I've learned the lesson the worst way.
1	Zipper ripped off within the first week.
1	Doesn't stick well to paper. Doesn't hold fine detail.
1	Installed correctly on the REC head unit in my 06 Jeep Commander to emulate VES and it did nothing. I could not select VES. I tried disconnecting and connecting again. Still nothing. Returned for refund. Garbage.
1	Leaks like crazy if u don't use the quick disconnect , but does have the normal hose thread. Only found useful on 0 setting to foam , but uses soap in about 15 secs. I've used many products and always like to try new ways to wash my car, i take a lot of pride in my car and keeping it clean, and beautiful
1	Product didn't make it a year before it quit recharging.
1	This hair is not good at all very disappointed this hair is always nappy I always have to comb it gets very tangled . I will Never purchase this hair wast of money.
1	Horrible product it did not work did not heat properly! Do not buy from them I accidentally threw the box away can’t return just don’t want others to buy from them! Don’t make my mistake
1	TRUCK DID NOT WORK... NO LIGHTS, NO SIREN.....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WORKED ON CHRISTMAS DAY. NOT EVEN AFTER BUYING NEW BATTERIES.
1	The item was so thin and flimsy. Did not offer comfort to my dog in her crate. It did wash well but I would not recommend this product. Dog finally tore it apart and I threw it out.
1	Super annoying. Shipped late, cases not as described. Don't waste your time. Don't let the photo fool you! Awkward, poorly designed. Very poor quality. Spend a little more and get something better. I am very disappointed.
1	Bought two of these lights and they seemed to work when tested. I mean they turned on and responded to sound as was expected. During an event ( first use) these lights had problems and did not respond to the remote and the buttons in the back. Also could not get the lights to work with the DMX and could not be slaved. Fussed with the light trying everything possible but had no success. Very disappointed as I was very excited for these lights. Luckily we had bought and brought other par lights from other brands that we used with no issues.
1	One of these works fine, the other will not be recognized by my phone.
1	HATE IT! HOSE LEAKS AND I CANNOT GET A RESPONSE FROM SELLER.
1	Have used this brand before with no issues. This batch all the pods had grounds in the coffee. Tried another brand to ck the machine--no issue. Amazon did refund the cost with no hassle.
1	I was truly disappointed in the product, thought it would of held more ashes, and also broke a screw top when sealing it on one of them
1	This is the nicer of the two i received. Not what I expected. Doesnt look like pics. Very disappointed.
1	The phone seemed like it was a good buy for the first month or two, until one day it stopped charging. Nokia refused to offer a refund and required me to send the phone in for repair. A week later I got it back and it seemed to be fixed. A month later the charging port failed again. This phone is not worth the headache you will experience trying to get it fixed. Do yourself a favor and just but a Pixel 3a, it costs a little bit more, but you won't have to deal with Nokia which is a bonus.
1	Did not work consistently right out of the box!The durability of these lighting charge cords is pure shit
1	Did not work wast of time sending anything back
1	Highly upset about this purchase, just had the lights installed, had to pay for that of course.. already had a fixture blow on me. Highly upset
1	App did not work with the Amazon Fire 10 tablet.
1	This either doesn’t keep the rain out or else provoked immediate condensation. Either way, if it starts raining the inside of these glove covers will be immediately wet.
1	White streaks show up after a few minutes of use.
1	Item showed up with no filter. I put in a request for a replacement. Once I get this setup finally I will update
1	Sucks! Doesn’t even work! Waste of money!
1	Very flimsy material . No protection
1	They sent me a face mask instead of the chest mask, I haven’t returned it yet. this is the first time I’ve ever ordered from Amazon and gotten the wrong thing.
1	The fabric is bad and cheap
1	Really cheap product. Card holder near impossible to open.
1	Doesn't work on Amazon fire stick for any device. Not Google. Not iOS. Waste of money.
1	I got this lounger within a few days of ordering. It is what I expected, versatile and fits my small space. I have not had a guest sleep on it yet, but it feels fine to me and my son as far as lounging around. The price is amazing, it is a good deal. No complaints, it all works well. The cover material seems strong and the frame seems solid.
1	This rack arrived so twisted/bent that it can not be assembled. I wanted it for an upcoming trip but I will not have enough time to return it, wait for the new one to arrive before my trip. Absolutely useless junk with no QC. I will just return this item and go to a local business to get one. Thanks for wasting my time.
1	Didn't come on time as all my Amazon Prime orders do when they say they will.
1	First time washed, regular cycle and steam came apart with fraying and shredding!
1	This product was about 4-5 inches too short to fit in my 2015 Honda CRV. Disappointed. Will be returning.
1	As per headline. Recd Jan 3, installed a week later and one burned out when turned car on this AM (Jan 24). They are definitely brighter than stock but a little expensive and time consuming to be replacing one every two weeks.
1	It doesn’t work Just they take money ! sorry for amazon to sell like this items .
1	Arrived with small dent on the front by the switches, no marks on box. Fan is noisy in the low speed. Would not buy this one again.
1	For getting a deal on this case from amazon instead of paying 100$ for it at Best Buy is cool. Yes it is lifeproof and water resistant but if you’re someone that is very active and planning on using it as your daily case I don’t recommend it. Long story short I work on a farm used the case for a week and my camera is useless now because is scratched and makes my pictures blurry which is very annoying considering the case is supposed to be scratch resistant...... 🙃
1	The projector power outlet built into the projector does not work properly as it is very loose therefore the projector does not stay connected to the power cord. This means it does not stay on long enough to project anything. I would never buy from this vendor again. Horrible product do not purchase it. Should be 0 stars
1	If you're looking for a way out of your marriage, you've just found it. Your love won't survive assembling this hulking mistake. The instructions were hard to follow, especially with someone screaming their eternal rage the entire time. If you have hearing aids, I'd suggest turning them off before you start. But, once you're done it doesn't end there. You will find new fury and hatred both for yourself and your partner as you realise the drawers don't work, none of them are aligned, and they catch when trying to open and close them. I hope you lift weights because you're gonna have to strong arm this drawer open anytime you need anything. The hardest part about this whole ordeal is that you don't realize how awful it truly is until after you put it together, and they require you to disassemble it to send it back. We won't be sending it back because a divorce is more expensive than the dresser.
1	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM. THE BRIM OF THIS HAT IS NOTHING BUT CARDBOARD. WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY. AMAZON, MAY I PLEASE HAVE MY MONEY BACK?
1	Toke forever to get my eyeliner stamps, haven’t tried them yet.
1	These shoes were not comfortable. They felt unstable.
1	I was supposed to get a knife sheath and got a tablecloth. You gotta be kidding me.really
1	Its just bot full very bare and so not worth 25.00
1	The length was perfect but only worked well for about 2 weeks. A complete waste of money.
1	The flashlight was great for a week... that was all it worked, and it was not the batteries. Amazon gave me a credit and I have since order another brand so I will try it again.
1	Z-wave plugins are all too big. They block at least one more outlet in addition to the one they're plugged into. You can't plug two into a standard, 2 outlet box. This seemed like a great solution. Unfortunately, the unit didn't work properly. It shut off one of the outlets at arbitrary times (leaving me with cold coffee). Also, the user-interface is very poor. Having to hit the tiny little button multiple times to turn one outlet on vs. the other is hard to do correctly (4 times to turn one one). And, no one in the house could remember all the variations for turning each outlet on/off. They really need to add another button so there is one for each outlet. It is beyond 30 days since I ordered it, otherwise, I would return it.
1	The book I received is NOT NEW although it was sold as such. It's banged up all over the margins and it has a mark right in the center of the title.
1	I ordered to find that this looks absolutely nothing like the website description. The proportions are different the product is very flat versus the pictures provided and overall was very disappointing, unless you have a pretty small member it will not fit. Don't purchase this as it will be a waste of time and money. I am surprised this has a good rating.
1	This was never emailed to me still waiting since July 17th 2018
1	Works great at about 10 feet away phone. Any farther it can't find a signal, disconnects... basically useless.
1	Nothing like the picture. Very short
1	My advice? Simply do not by this drive. This is the 5th one...that's right...the 5th one that I've had to return under warranty. Each has failed suddenly leaving me without a secondary back-up drive. Do not buy this drive unless you want maximum unreliability, down time on your drive, the hassle of setting up an RMA, and a trip to the post office (you pay the return shipping)
1	Not sure if it was just mine, but my picture is not clear at all.
1	Did not work at all. Was a gift for a child.
1	I really hope the company reads this and fixes the issue at hand. I recently purchased a brand new textbook and the binding isn’t even attached. I would 100% have rather gotten a used scribbled in book since now this book will be helpless dragging to and from class. The book literally came out of a plastic wrap like this and I have no idea how this could happen.
1	Ripped in the wind, lasted one windy day only
1	This is not for windows it’s definitely a shower curtain
1	Dont buy this crap .. Only came with 1 ear piece && it was hugh i don't think no human ear could fit this please dont buy
1	Loses packages on the road. Sucks
1	Do not waste your time or money on these. Have tried using them to seal dry food products used 3 bags and not one of them stayed sealed, all we reinflated within 5 minutes. Will be purchasing a proper vacuum sealer and never use these again.
1	Died after 6 months. Waste of money.
1	I’ve had this before and tasted great. However this batch tasted spoiled. Can’t return! Very frustrating
1	Would not stick, opened package followed instructions and won’t stick
1	The mask is not black. It is white. I assumed I was received the color I received and 5 additional ones for the cost. Others are much cheaper for the one listed. I’m waiting on a response from the seller and will update when I get it.
1	not bright enough. we tossed in trash.
1	Bought 2; they both died two after opening them. Tried to recharge batteries but screws in the units are so small that no screw driver could loosen them. not worth the effort to even return them.
1	An entire piece was missing from the split and taped carton but we were too far along to repack it and send it back. Pieces didn't fit together well so we had to make adjustments. Poorly designed.
1	Has a chemical smell reminiscent of hospital antiseptic. Doesn't go very far- lots of pumps for a body wash. Wish I could sent it back. Definitely won't purchase again.
1	Been buying stuff online for longer then I can remember and this probably is the worst item I have ever gotten. No instructions included and horrible quality. You can get better at IKEA and that's pretty bad.
1	So during 2nd Rifle season, up in the Colorado mountains, on Day 6 of the hunt.. mother nature decided to gift us with ~8 inches of snow. Finally, I had the opportunity to try out my Frogg Togg's and pull them out of my ruck. For the first couple hours, standing up right and walking through the snow looking for elk tracks, they worked great. They kept my legs dry and provided an extra layer of insulation. Despite it being around 13 degrees, my legs and torso were fine and I actually overhearing if anything after about an hour of walking in the snow. Then, we get back to the camp site.... We decided to throw on the snow chains to the truck in case we got can animal and needed mobility to move it. I took my first knee in my brand new, first time ever worn Frogg Togg bottoms... and the crotch blew out. Talk about disappointment. Maybe I received a defective product? Manufacturer/Amazon seller, please let me know if this is true. Or, is taking a knee while wearing these just out if the question? I was wearing 1 layer of thin poly pro's, one pair of super thin athletic pants (ADIDAS), a pair of Carhart hunting pants bottoms, and then XXL Frogg Togg bottoms when this happened. I felt like I was swimming in my clothing and was not expecting the crotch to pop. I mean, I could understand if I was wearing a Large, maybe even a XL, but come on..it was a 2XL. Am I supposed to be rocking 3 or 4X in order to be able to perform a simple function such as taking a knee? In closing.. thankfully the top I have is in good shape and no issues so far. Buyers beware. At least for the pants... which is what you need most! if I wanted to only protect my top, I would have went with my poncho.
1	Worked great for a month. As soon as the return window closed I started getting “This accessory may not be supported” with my iphoneX. Still seems to be working fine with my old iPad mini though. Bummer.
1	Not a single good candle in the box, they were all bent.
1	So disappointed in this product. It was not as pictured. The picture shows a more square bag. The one I received was more slouchy. I purchased it to use for work for a laptop. Theres no way it would fit. I ended up donating this bag.
1	Hard to seal. When I finally got them sealed they did not stay sealed.
1	Light stops working in a few days 😡
1	The decanter I received is not what is advertised. I received a cheap knock off made from thin glass weighing in at only 8oz compared to the 2lb. Decanter advertised, as well as a smooth bottom instead of a crimped to protect the bottom.
1	This router also suffers from the "Netgear Upload bug". I'm not paying to go through this BS again. For anyone who gets this bug, the fix involves several factory resets in a row - or if you are feeling lucky: 1 factory reset and several router power cycles until you see your upload speed go above 0.2 mbps. A google search shows that this issue has been around since at least 2015. Otherwise, this router looks like it would have been good on paper. Returning to Amazon.
1	This guage MUST be installed with the relief port facing up, yet 99% of hose spigots point down. It is unusable in this manner.
1	Item was missing. Had to request a refund.
1	The product is good however the company sent me two right wrist wraps. Which makes it very difficult to put on. My friend had ordered this product and didn't have any problems. I am unhappy with this.
1	I plug the DVD-RW external drive into my laptop and hear it whirl but I can't find it "anywhere" on my desktop. Tried a restart, made sure that the external drive was seen in "preferences' and still nothing, I can't even find a website for support. Total waste of money so don't waste yours on this product.
1	Terrible smell for two weeks of airing out. Awful support after using for only about three weeks. Into the garbage. Kept the pillow cases which are terrific.
1	Didn’t find these brushes useful.
1	I love the scent and everything, but I probably won't buy it from this store again. It leaked in the packaging and was literally everywhere. Almost a 1/8 of it was gone because no one at their store bothered to make sure the lid was on all the way.
1	I was not sent what I ordered. What I recieved SUCKS. it's not organic it smells horrible and the chemicals made me nauseous
1	case was scratched when I got it
1	Couldn't select zero stars. When the light comes on, the power to the bulb is reduced dramatically. The bulb will be so dim that you might as well go back to fumbling for your keys in the dark! I bought 2 and both did the same thing. Very disappointed with Intermatic brand. I've used their products before and the quality was always great. Cheap imported junk.
1	When I placed the order, the website listing said 6 packs of 25. I received 3 packs of 25. When I clicked back on the order link it showed 3 packs of 25 as what I was buying. I would never pay that price for 3 packs of 25. All of the reviews indicate 150 wipes was the product ordered. Other purchasers indicate they had the same problem. Amazon did make it right.
1	This tastes like liquid splenda. The aftertaste is horrible. Now I’m stuck with two bottles of syrup that I don’t want to throw away because they cost money and I know will stay in the shelve until I give up. Bought it after a FB page continued to rave about it but obviously she’s getting paid because I don’t know how else you can recommend this product. Monk fruit is not a tasty sugar substitute.
1	Don't waste your money. Cheap cheap cheap!
1	The product was not worth purchasing. I had to reglue the cupcake stars onto the sticks.
1	The were coming apart so could not use
1	I’ve used this product on several different animals for about a month and I haven’t noticed any improvements on the hot spots. This product doesn’t work, don’t waste your money on over priced oils.
1	Seriously????? The A it’s wrong!!!!
1	Item was ripped, damaged, flower was ripped out of dress, it even had a hole, to make it worse it had stains on the dress and was way to long for a 3 year old, and shipped at wrong address, will be returning the item soon.
1	Two of the cords stopped working. This was possibly due to substandard materials
1	This is the worst filter I have ever had. There was a foul strong plastic taste to the water. My unfiltered tap water tastes much better. Tested the water from the filter and the TDS level is much higher then the tap water. A complete waste of money. Will stick with a reputable filter company in the future.
1	Every time I placed my order item were delivered broken
1	Lasted one day, doesnt stay connected. Tried to balance it to charge ..nothing worked....
1	Chose wrong thing. Was trying to download the real Hulu!
1	Very low quality, looking at the pictures I was expecting better. It’s very thin and image is badly printed.
1	The antenna reception was sadly lower than I expected & does not work.
1	I washed these one time and this is what they look like. It is clearly fabric defect and the threads are pulling loose. I have contacted the company 3x via written communication and no response. I left a voice mail and no response. And THEY DO NO ANSWER PHONES OR E-MAILS. There's ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. I should have known it was too good to be true. Money wasted.
1	My dog normally devours any bully stick in minutes, he loves them. He would not touch these. Smelled them and literally walked away. Not sure why but we did notice these had a crimson red color which we have never seen with other bully sticks.
1	I bought this because I read all the positive reviews. It had the opposite effect for me. I bought it to generally use as a hand lotion to soften and moisturize my hands. It has done the complete opposite. It has dried out my hands and left them looking scaly - literally! This was after about a week of using it. It has also left my hands so dry that I am snagging my clothing when I have to put clothes on or adjust them, especially nylons. I am sending it back. I'll go back to my previous hand lotion, which never left them dry. I just tried this because it supposedly had healthier ingredients and didn't leave a greasy residue.
1	Unfortunately it was not as sturdy as we would have liked. Will be sending this back.
1	This is a bright light, Seems to be good quality, but I just took it on its second dive and it flooded out destroying the light and one of my batteries. Looks like all of the seals were in tact so it must be the switch?
1	I got these and I was SO excited to get them on my Jeep. After install, with NO CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS, and it took all day, we finally got to turn the lights on. That is where the problem began. The halo white lights work. The remote, and the color changes along with the App they tell you to install, none of this turned on the colors of the Halo lights. The only reason I wanted these was so have clear and color choices. Now I am stuck with the lights on my jeep with no color. Then, they also put in a piece of paper telling you that after you install this, a relay item that you can use for the colors might be defected and will have to be sent back to them for the company see "IF" it is defected. I am SO SO SO disappointed with the product. If you want these lights, I suggest you find another manufacture then these guys. Waste of time and money. I will post a picture later of the paper that I am talking about that came in the box.
1	Came all damage!! Need more care when they sent it !!!!
1	What I liked was the price and qhat I disliked was it was not durable. I don't know if it was the charger or the wire but it doesn't work.
1	The spiral wire binding does not hold the pages securely. There is a significant gap in the wire binding, and with minimal use of the planner, the pages started falling off the spiral entirely. Like the design, layout and tabs, but it's useless as it doesn't hold together.
1	The middle of the paddle is higher than the outside as soon as it is a bit wet I slide all over the pedal. These are not usable for mountain biking.
1	I didnot receive the item, so I emailed the seller to inquire the status. However, after sending couple emails to the seller, I didnot get any response from the seller.
1	I ordered two of these, they look solid and I was hopeful they would hold up. Both broke within just a couple of weeks use. Disappointing and a waste of time and money.
1	This pan performed well the first 3 times used maybe, then everything sticks, not a non-stick pan at all.
1	Doesn't fit on all desk types
1	You can't even pick up these balls without crushing them.
1	terrible taste to hard will not be buying this no more do not recommend
1	Just purchased an Apple Watch series 5 and I wanted to protect the screen face, these screen protector fit the face however the interaction/feel with the watch is often unresponsive making the experience a big disappointment - I will not be using these screen protectors.
1	No change. Maybe it’s just my skin type
1	I like mixer but beater broke 3rd time I used it. I was making frosting so was soft ingredients. Appears rusty, weak solder joint . Contacted Aicok and they said they didn't sell accessories but would send out returned mixer that had good beaters. That was 2 months ago and now the seem to be backing out of doing anything. Save your money. Beaters are defective.
1	Worst experience ever on amazon I bought a table, balls and an extra set of players , but days later they said they don’t ship to California ...... but just the table won’t be shipped, you’ll be stuck with the rest, and you will be charged when trying to return Costumer service is rude and very poor
1	Update: the dress is still missing eyelets after my second order. I am returning it again and I hope third time is a charm. My daughter is dancing the waltz in her friend’s quinceanera and they are wearing this dress. However, it is missing eyelets so I have to return it and I hope the next one has eyelets. This is so frustrating!
1	Product received quickly and packaged well. However, no 6 foot cord with dimmer switch was included in the box. Would love to be enjoying all the benefits of my new lamp but that’s impossible without the main part to make it a lamp. Very frustrated!
1	Never received the item I ordered
1	These orange juice (small bottles) tasted as if the dates were expired long back...they do not taste even 10% close to the fresh one you buy in grocery store....stay away.
1	This was my second one in about 6 months, the first one broke (the plastic that allows the clock face to snap in, split apart). I re-ordered in hopes it was a fluke but the second one broke in the same way after only 3 weeks.
1	It wasn't the same size as pictured. They are not sticking to wall they started falling off the next day. Dont buy!
1	Bought it to go to Mexico so I could go in water. Wore it for 10days in pool and straps turn all yellow. So now the watch is white but the straps are all yellow. ugly
1	Do not buy from this seller. The card did not work.
1	This was received with a big crack in the glass. It is a bit crazy to send back the broken glass
1	Installed an about 2 days later it started spraying water out of the tank...Bag had a hole in it... Not worth the trouble of time an cost to send back....Will buy another product elsewhere...
1	Totally sent the wrong size. Ugh!! Ordered XS was sent a large. In a time crunch
1	This is happening too many times, receiving the wrong item. I received the wrong book before and now I received the wrong puzzle. I kept the puzzle because I did not have it. Again I am very disappointed with Amazon.
1	Was sold on this item when advertised with a 50 recipe book. Came with nothing, not even a link for download. Needless to say I'm disappointed.
1	This is terrible. Keeps falling apart. You can get better from the dollar store.
1	I love the product but it's too small and collapses on its own
1	I received this chair today and definitely regret buying it. The off gasses made me and my son both sick with difficulty breathing and sore throats. There was no odor however some chemicals do not have a smell. There is formaldehyde per the package insert. Wish I had known this before buying. The reviews seemed to convince me that it was also pretty comfy but sadly I would not want to sit in this chair for More than a few minutes. It’s very firm and not the chair I was hoping for. It’s currently outside off gassing and will most likely keep it because I’m too lazy to pack it back up. It will probably grace the corner in spare room to torment any guests we have in the future.
1	Useless. It continually gets punctures along the seem which are very difficult to patch. I'm 4 patches in at this stage and have given up. Overall I think I got about 30mins use out of this thing before the punctures started. Then I spent about 3 hrs identifying & fixing various punctures. What a waste of $50.
1	It never arrived I'm still waiting after 5 months
1	worked for a couple of weeks terrible product
1	Love the product. Hate ordering it from Amazon. At least twice, Amazon has cancelled my order on the day it was scheduled to arrive. Why sell it if you can’t safely deliver a liquid formula?
1	Received 3 hardback and 3 paperback
1	Its to small can even fit enough wipes
1	In my opinion the magnet on this band is extremely weak. It constantly slides and loosens all day long. If the magnet held I would have given 5 stars. It’s very comfortable, I’m just annoyed that I have to tighten the strap back up every 15 minutes or so
1	This LED lights did not stick to my walls. I set them up in my room (efficiently, I made sure they shouldnt fall off) and left for a couple hours. When I came back they had completely fallen off. I messaged them to see if I could get my money back or if another one could be sent to me because I thought maybe the one I received was defective and they never even responded and its been 2 weeks.
1	I got a 3X and they are ridiculously small. More like a medium. Don't waste your money.
1	Heats very unevenly on our glass-top stove. Had a horrible time trying to cook pancakes, some were under-done, some burned. It's smaller than I expected -- it really only fits three or four pancakes at once (my old electric griddle easily fit six). I also don't like the extra maintenance requirements (wiping it down with oil after every wash). I do not recommend this griddle.
1	Made me feel like I was being manipulated through propaganda. I hate that. No thank you.
1	Didn’t last 3 months and doesn’t work !! Disappointed would not recommend buying this at all!!
1	These locks are easy to program and seemed like they would work great. However, after a week one of the locks stopped working. It won’t close at all. This is very inconvenient because I shared the package with a friend so I only have one lock which no longer works.
1	Good thermal qualities but the material is too stiff. They don’t hang well at all. Very disappointed but will serve there purpose for the rest of the Michigan winter.
1	Garbage! Fell off on the first ride once I got into the freeway. Luckily noone was killed by this flying price if debris
1	The connection on the left headphone doesn’t work.
1	Lasted for about 2 months, now most of them are not working or will work sparingly. Also the charging port connector was easily bender and damaged .
1	This thing is a piece of crap! It stopped working within a couple of weeks :-(
1	Looks nothing like the picture. Did not cover the entire Juul. The cutout for the LED was on the sides so when you wrapped it, there was a line down the middle of the Juul in the front. Poorly designed and would not recommend buying.
1	Starting braking within 1 month
1	This is advertised as bait......it's not...........it will kill them if they walk through it so I dusted it under my appliances, but the lure part.........nada
1	I’ve been taking this product for a week now. I’ve been staying faithful on exercising and low carb. I haven’t lost one pound. Frustrated
1	Not very thick. Wasn't what I was expecting. Returned
1	This product looks good at face value but didn’t last me 6 months. I think I need to have a refund.
1	I never even received the candles. Poor service. The rating is zero.
1	I don’t know how this pad works —it kept my sheets cool but made me extremely hot during the night. By blocking all my body heat my memory foam mattress felt like sleeping on a rock.
1	I received this today and am new to the product. I ignored the negative reviews thinking it had so many good reviews. I do not know what the consistency is supposed to be like but I know I do not like this. It is like pouring water out of a container. There is no thickness to the product and is like the bubble mixture you make for kids to blow bubbles with dish soap. I ordered two scents. Diva smelled fine. High Maintenance smelled like bug spray. I did a load of laundry and spilled way too much detergent into the wash because of consistency. I say this because there was no smell on the clothes when removing them from the washing machine. I would spend way too much money on something that smells good and lasts. That brand promise is exciting. I do not know if this is how it is supposed to be or if in fact this is not the real product. I cannot imagine wanting to purchase this product based on this. Maybe someone can tell me if this is how it is supposed to be and if so, how do I have any success with the product? Thanks!
1	it was cute but when i tried making it shorter with the tools that were provided the little tool to take out the band got stuck in one of the links and one of the little pins from the link got stuck when i tried taking them out to make it shorter it was cute but what a waste of money
1	This was a birthday gift and it came broken in pieces! I felt so bad about it I didn’t tell my daughter! Otherwise I think it would hav been a very cute mug!
1	Sound and lights come on but he doesn’t pop out to take the coin. Bummer.
1	I thought I will use for water so that i don’t have to use too many plastic bottles but it failed. It leaks all the time no matter how we set up. Don’t buy!! Not worth with price u pay.
1	Used it to keep my outdoor plants watered while we were gone. Stated they would keep your plants watered for up to two weeks. We were gone 4 days and one plant was dead, & the water was gone from the bulbs. Would not recommend.
1	The basket is fine, but ridiculously overpriced. You can buy the exact same thing at Target for $5.99. I did not realize this until it was too late and they were going to charge me almost $10 per box to mail them back so I am kind of stuck.
1	I've been trying to install this product for 5 days and all web site taking me over the place with not resolve
1	These nozzles are absolute JUNK. It took almost the whole package to find 12 that work. 8 didn't fit, 6 had the center orifice blow out the minute I turned the system on. I have requested a full refund from Amazon. If you have a high pressure system DO NOT BUY these!!!
1	Was excited to receive this product today. Unfortunately it's broken. The bottom part of the case is cracked.
1	the instant pot mini pot holders are worthless. You can actually feel the heat wearing them almost burning your fingers. I have an instant pot and i was surprised mitts wer such poor quality
1	don't get me wrong the product is great but when I went to the local walmart it was a least half less$ if not more.
1	Incorrect sizing -made for Chinese. Much too heavy for a holiday suitcase. Hard to get on anyway even if the size was right. Had to return and postage cost me nearly as much as the refunded price. Beware buyin goods from abroad.
1	Wow what a rip off! $30 for ten strips!? I thought it was ten boxes. Complete misrepresentation. By at cvs instead for $5. Do not buy!
1	Would not recommend. Poorly made. When we went to set up and plug in the lights one of the candy canes did not light up at all.
1	Unfortunately, this broke after about two months. I have also noticed some of the rhinestones are starting to discolor. I really liked it for a while, but disappointed in the durability.
1	I received broken and sent a message to seller and no response it’s been one month won’t buy from carrier again.
1	Less than 60 days into use it’s completely broke.... won’t turn on, won’t deflate etc.
1	Very light weight and thin... POOR quality seems like a product that costs 50 cents to make. Issued a return and they didn’t even want me to ship it back so I gave it away.
1	Very cheap, no instructions. What is the point to these?
1	This is the second unit I tried and both failed to charge. The first never took a charge and I returned it and decided that I must have got a bad unit and tried again. Don't waste your money on any these as they are all pretty much the same thing with a different sticker. All cheap junk.
1	Lunch box arrived today with a jagged, very sharp broken zipper pull. Would have cut a child most certainly. When I held the pull to take the photo the pull fell right off. Otherwise the lunch box looked great.
1	Did not use I ended up sending them back because they were the wrong size.
1	Can I give this zero stars? This product made my windshield worse! I tried it both wet and dry and neither worked. It just smeared the dirt on the windshield and left a cloudy film that when driving at night, I could barely see. Then, after a couple wipes, the handle started to crack. It's made of real cheap plastic. I am returning. Unfortunate cause I have a severely slanted windshield and I can't reach the bottom.
1	Killed my hair. I’m Asian, with normal thickness hair, straight, dyed hair. Avoid like the plague if you know what’s good for you.
1	was sent a steely dan CD.
1	Not worth buying terrible product
1	This pan worked great ... for four months. We followed care instructions perfectly, always washed it by hand and never with a rough sponge. However, already, any and all food sticks to the bottom and creates a mess every time we cook with it. So disappointed with this purchase and cannot recommend to anyone.
1	Doesn't work in a Manhattan apartment, unfortunately there is too much interference. Item returned to Amazon without problem.
1	It’s too big for the Radio Flyer swing which I bought it for. This is more for the industrial type swings you see in the parks.
1	Slowly drops down until it hits my keyboard. Tiny screw and Allen wrench to adjust the weight balance is a joke. Everything seems sturdy and well made except the most import part, the hinge. Like the other reviewer said I'm going to jam paper in the hinge to keep it from slowly sinking. Save your money, buy another brand.
1	Did not play on either of my machines. Players could not read it. Very odd. Have never had that happen with any other movies.
1	It is not consistent at all. I have a Samsung S10 and it seems to charge for a few minutes and then the indicator light starts to blink. Then it changes for a minute or two and it does the same thing. It never really changes the phone properly. I'm glad I have a different one now.
1	I had a CHEAP Harbor Freight tire kit I have been using for 10 years, I bought this one because it looked like a better quality. MY MISTAKE! Tire plug tool snapped in two first time I tried to plug a tire. I finished the job with my cheap HF kit. This is going in the trash.
1	One didnt even work, just get some CT Sounds speakers, theyre cheaper and actually work
1	The worst purchase I think I've ever made in a sock
1	Smells bad. Doesn’t work at all.
1	It came with no instructions! How do i find them?
1	Box was empty. Well, the shipping box contained a case for the lenses, but the case was empty. So I apparently purchased a very expensive glasses case. Very disappointing.
1	Poorly written. Too many side stories that didn’t add to the storyline.
1	Returned the rugs they were too thin, not good for a bathroom.
1	Description: "leather cover", not leather. What a waste. Why publish an in accurate product description?
1	Ordered on the 11th of July and here it is the 24th and still no order has arrived
1	These are cute, but many of the tips of the pinwheels were bent, and NINE of the sticks were missing. I don't have time to return these and reorder so my event is just going to be short nine pinwheels.
1	I’ve had this container 2 days. The lid has been on tight and the ants still got in. I’m very upset. I threw out the box and now I’m not sure how to return it. No seller to contact to work anything out. I’m very unsatisfied with this product.
1	The sticky back tape failed to stick to painted sheet rock. Holder falls off the wall everyday. Even removed the dust cover to reduce the weight. Still fell off. Ended up drilling a couple of holes in the holder so I could mount the product to the wall with screws. Wouldn't buy another product that mounts with only tape.
1	The coloring came off all of the tongue rings! I have had my tongue pierced for about 15 years; with these tongue rings I chipped two teeth one very badly do not buy!!!
1	Have read the reviews for a small pair of binoculars and thought these would be worth it. Decent for the size but very cheap plastic design that came scratched and rubber eye pieces bent and wet (weird I know). Looking for somewhere else to buy binoculars.
1	Ordered beginning of June didn't receive until August 22. When it did arrive it was clumpy 😠😠
1	This sharpener worked for a while, but stopped working. It tries to sharpen pencils, but it wont sharpen them anymore.
1	Way too big for 13" MacBook--the product description states it is for 13" and very clearly is not--there's an inch and a half of extra space of both length and width. I recommend avoiding this product as its product description is not accurate.
1	Two of the six bulbs came broken. I have used the other four bulbs up in six months. They work fine, but don’t last long. Very disappointed.
1	Worked for 1 out of 4 ball joints. The clamp bent and was very difficult to hold all the parts in the correct sequence to instal the others.
1	Bag has a hole in it from delivery. Flax seeds are in the delivery box not the flax seed bag
1	Cheap material. I ended up donating! The product did not arrived on time. Disappointed as it was for my daughters graduation.
1	I never recieved the order...I looked up my order derails and it said it was hand deliverd to customer...it wasn't me. Someone out there has my order!
1	This description says it has a drop down cup holder. It does not. The sofa is very nice but I wanted the cup holders so I didn't have to get end tables.
1	(Husbands account) I like my maxi dresses to touch the floor and this dress was above my ankles. I returned the dress and got refunded in the same day so that was great!
1	I never received my order.
1	I have not been able to access white noise premium on Alexa at all.
1	Doesnt work :( me and my 2004 mazda 3 were very disappointed
1	Don't waste your money. This thing is wildly inaccurate, even after following their poorly written instructions to calibrate it I could never get a consistent reading. Not even their own buffering powder could get the same reading twice
1	This products SUCKS. I tried 4 patches in a row and it did not work at all. This product should not even be on amazon. What a waste of $20. And it is very uncomfortable when you put it on.
1	this stuff is a wast of money it doesn't do any thing and it has a weird smell don't waist your money
1	Very cheap, it breaks easily... the material is cheap
1	I don’t know if it’s just me but I can’t get past the taste, I’m not sure if the canister was a bad batch because the taste was unbearable. I wanted to try this and was actually excited.
1	Bought for airsoft doesnt work even with have the loaded amount in their.. spring action is weak for 20$
1	I have used the black precut tape & it works fantastic. This red tape isn't very good & will not stick to my fingers while bowling.
1	Tastes bad, quit spraying immediately after two uses. No way to refund of return. Buyer beware and avoid!!!
1	In the bottle, several of the capsules had come apart and the content distributed across the remainder. I realized this the hard way. As I placed a capsule in my mouth, and prior to swallowing, I breathed inward. Thus, I sucked cinnamon and cayenne dust into my lungs. I thought I was going to die. Coughing, burning lungs, eyes watering, etc for about a half hour. I have no idea whether the product is otherwise any good, as I tossed the remainder into the trash.
1	It was used when I received it though I most definitely clicked on the new option.The colors look nice but I can't bring myself to touch the pallets. The dark blue color was emptied to the edges as if it had been used though there was a sticker on the opening as if it were a new product. It is otherwise as pictured and was delivered on time.
1	Not at all what I expected poor choices on receipes
1	THE PRODUCT SENDING THE "SELLER" IS DIFFERENT AND OF MUCH LOWER VALUE THAN THE ONE PUBLISHED.
1	Didn’t last long about a month?ALL Zippers broke within days and dark stains on the outside out of know where not very good quality at all
1	Arrived broken. Received an email about quality assurance asking to email them back if any issues were found. Emailed them. Never heard back.
1	Received the wrong size 4 times!! Customer service only refunds and asks you to reorder. Ridiculous. If I could leave less than 1 star I would.
1	Received an open and used one..... i ordered and was charged for a new one. $60 is way too much for this item used.
1	no instructions enclosed, very hard to figure out. Took longer than 15 minutes.
1	Thought it would be a good thing to try for adhd child. Did not see any change.
1	These batteries have the incorrect circuitry to charge with Milwaukee chargers. The batteries themselves may be fine, but good luck charging on a Milwaukee brand charger. Since day 1, I have to insert the battery roughly 20 times in and out of the charger before they start charging. If anyone knows of an aftermarket charger or a way to rewire the Milwaukee charger, I’d love to hear about it. Currently looking for dead Milwaukee batteries to pull the circuitry and maybe fix these.
1	unbreathable item, I though it is because of the size; so I decided to replace the item but the issue as a customer you must pay for the refound shipping which cost around 4 dollars and the item itself 9 dollar .. doesn't make any sense !!!!
1	The straws came in broken , how I suppose to give my child dirty straws. I was not happy with delivery.
1	Absolute junk. They fell apart the first time I wore them. I had been in the pool for 3 or 4 minutes when they started to split at the seam.
1	These are so cheaply made that just opening the clasp can break it.
1	I bought these to drive away gophers, they have been in the ground 2 months now and I still have active gophers all around these spikes, one of these spikes shuts off and I have to turn it off and back on each day for it to work the other three work fine making noise just not working for gophers.
1	Never received this item.
1	Used it for a very short while and phone froze! Its DEAD! Seller is not very helpful... JUNK!!!
1	This is not your normal Lil mover diapers I had the same thing happen to my son as some of the other reviewers. Shortly after starting to use these my son broke out in a horrible rash we have used this diaper before from else where with no issue and even from amazon. Also if your not extremely careful in how you place the diaper the band will cut your child's leg/hip area. Very displeased in these would not recommend buying these. I'm thinking maybe some of these are not really Huggies thrown in with real ones because of the reviews and my own experience. It seems like maybe one in 20 or so is a knock off and if you get them it's horrible I don't plan to risk it again. Furthermore for my son to break out in such a way it worries me of what these diapers contain I hope they don't have some harmful chemical on them. My son does not have sensitive skin and has never broke out like this before
1	This is flimsy and not as strong as the other ones. I do not recommend this.
1	These are either total GARBAGE or I have some very smart Wasp and Hornets. I've watch at least 7 go in....and get out whenever they want. Has yet to trap ONE "forever".
1	I successfully installed this initially, but tried to place it on an SSD from a regular platter and found the license key is not recognised by MicroSoft.
1	Received broken and missing parts
1	I have been waiting for a very long time. My order was never received even though the records show it as delivered. I was here all day, that includes the time of 'delivery'. The package was never delivered.
1	Install was easy and fits perfectly but it so unbalanced that the vibration makes it impossible to mow. Spend some extra and get the original OEM parts.
1	Ripped paint off the wall. Had no idea this could happen. Put plenty on to more than hold the picture per instructions. Came in the next day to find picture hanging by one hook and other hook and paint torn off the wall.
1	Ordered two cartridges, one has a faulty circuit which looks melted while the other arrived with the ink leaking staining me and my desk while opening the package.
1	Junk. Absolute garbage. They fell apart almost immediately. They don't fit or conform to your face at all. Very uncomfortable.
1	Only 2 bulbs work, 2 bulbs just don't turn on and one twitches, just AWFUL, and it's not a soft white either, it's a daylight color.
1	Recieved this battery as pictured. Contacted seller but will not reply.
1	Center part started detaching from the edge part the first time we used it. By the second use, it was completely falling apart, and we threw it away. Complete junk.
1	Worked great. Once. Then stopped working. Major waste of money and I’m irritated because it was a gift. Don’t bother.
1	Customer service was great when i had a concern about the product
1	Its cheap made. Looks like the ones you can buy at wish. And they are way cheaper on wish.
1	Suit is starting to fade after a few wears. After the 10th wear the suit is almost bleached out. I liked that is was fully lined but now the suit looks terrible.
1	It's NOT waterproof and will start to ruin the moment you use your watch in the water. If you plan on swimming or bathing with your watch one, I do not recommend this protector. Find one of those glass tempered ones
1	I have purchased 4 of these, the claim to work for hot liquids however 3 of them cracked on the first use and fell apart. The plastic does not withstand drinkable coffee temps.. I’m not a huge hot freak, but these did not last.
1	Put the screen protector on after cleaning the screen with the included materials. Felt like it was clicking against the screen and fell off the screen after 2 hours, cracking on the ground. Don't waste money on this protector.
1	Garbage.. not worth putting on my truck whatsoever..
1	they came in an amazon package, when I opened it, the candles came out and 2 were broken, the bag they came in, was even ripped.. not cool
1	Thought we had found a great replacement. About halfway through 2 of colors exploded and ruined my printer.
1	this was very disappointing as I do like your other ingredients and I also like the different flavors. This was absolutely horrible, there is no taste at all. I will never order this again and recommend the same that others should do.
1	False advertising!!!! I didn’t think to read the oz. considering the picture! Very deceptive
1	Bought these about two months ago and none of them work now. Occasionally the cord works for one second then stops, then you have to unplug the cord or try reinserting just for it to stop working again. Complete waste of money.
1	Great product But when I received my package my conditioner was spilled in the package I’m very dissatisfied
1	I am clearly the exception (it would seem) but here under shirts --- that are sweat proof -- seemed to increase my core temperature by 20-30 degrees. Ok - I am exaggerating but I was traveling by car and pulled over to take my shirt and tie off and rid myself of the undershirt so that I could cool down before my meeting. How? How does this work for others but makes me hot & sweaty. I bought two shirts and two underpants - I will say that the underpants seem better but truthfully I think the shirt experience sullied the whole deal.
1	I did not like the fact that it doesn't resemble the feel of a real guitar. I thought I was going to be to be able to practice playing on the go, but this was not the case. If you're looking for a practice tool to help you learn where to put your fingers I guess this would work. If you're looking for anything more than that this is not what you're looking for
1	I got these not even a week ago and the fur inside of the slipper is already detaching from the slipper. Very disappointed.
1	Ordered two of them. Almost $30 each one of them. Both of them not healthy looking. Will never purchase from this seller
1	It seemed like a bad idea, but I bought it to try with my trusty Bosch router. It was a bad idea. The cone wobbles off center so it can not be trusted as a centering pin.
1	The product never arrived.
1	The salt lick may be very good for the animals. But it lasts as long as it is not rained on. One or two good storms it melts away to nothing. Not worth the price to only be available for a couple of weeks. Use the larger mineral blocks. They tend to last an entire season.
1	Product came already open and falling out.
1	It’s shaped like a triangle, nothing close to this picture
1	Shattered in transit.
1	First off they don’t give enough washers to assemble properly. It’s difficult to assemble. Once assembled the feeder bar plugs very easily with fertilizer even with dry fertilizer but has slightly soft pellets. The material I was using has a black pellet that plugged the feeder bar. The 3 bags gone. $150 bucks. Most fertilizers now have soft pellets. This thing plugs them in the feeder bar and it turns into a solid bar. It needs a different feeder bar to work with today’s fertilizers.
1	This product description does not match the picture. The wrong coat was sent to me twice. I’m not ordering from this company again.
1	It simply did not work. I turned on the water. By the time I went back into the motorhome the floor was flooded and the carpet was soaked because the valve does not shut off. Amazon took care of the cost of the valve but I have the cost of the clean up.
1	These said they would be here in a few days but came much later. I needed them for a party and they did not arrive in time. I tried to return it and they would not accept a return.
1	The support iron bars got some thing to put on for them to stay attached to the frame but that thing breaks easily and make the iron bars fall.
1	Very poor workmanship
1	Not firm enough its thin
1	I really like the size of this puzzle because my little one can grab the knobs with ease; however, this puzzle falls apart within minutes of use. Poor quality. Its as though the puzzle is made of paper. (maybe it is) I had to take it away from my little one because she was just eating little pieces of the puzzle as they came off. Really disappointed. Maybe this item should be suggested for older children.
1	After taking quite a while to be delivered, what I received was an obviously used, damaged table with a broken equipment. As you can see from the pictures, the legs are scraped and damaged with 4- 6 inch scrapes on both sides and the mechanical pieces that are supposed to hold the table top on are snapped entirely off. You can see these laying on my counter in the photograph. They are supposed to be attached to the bottom of the table top, which you can see in a separate photo. They sent me broken junk which was likely previously returned which either I must accept, or go through the hassle of sending all the way back to them and cross my fingers that I get another one that’s actually not damaged.
1	These were absolutely horrible, heavy, and bulky and not usable. I intend to return them .
1	Broke within 5 minutes of opening. Total trash.
1	We've now had two of these break. I would not suggest buying this model, but if you're set on this brand than by one of the newer models. Although, if they're making memories cheap they'll break 2.
1	Did not receive items
1	Waste of money. Gets stuck in the phone
1	Ordered two organizers and they both came in cracked and scratched after week of waiting. I’d return then if there was no fee for shipping. It seems like case is thick enough even though it’s cracked and scratch. Going to keep them but it’s not for long term item.
1	I love thyme from my Melaleuca products an I thought this would ne great but not does smell like wet dog or a dog after bath - just not a goo smell I want throughout my house :(
1	I did not receive this package, where is it?
1	This product was made overseas. No doubt! The quality says it all. When installing the app for the camera we had such a horrible experience. My phone froze for a long time, and change some of my settings. The app we installed was giving my phone some sort of virus. For some strange reason we were unable to uninstall the app, so we had to do a factory reset. I thought that was extremely weird. Therefore I give it a one only 🌟. I was expecting decent quality but this was Far Beyond.
1	Too small size, it was painful to bike with
1	I am a writer and i enjoy reading any book about writing i can find. This one was insufferable. It's one metaphor for writing after another. Im not sure how the chapters were decided because the stories or random ramblings seem to come from out of the blue with no real connection to each other. It just rambles on to the point that i had no interest in finishing it. This one is a must miss
1	Of the three lights purchased only one works as advertised. Their seems to be a problem with the motion sensors. One light turns on intermittently. One works only if you place your hand directly on the sensor. Only one light works as advertised. The installation is simple. The lights while on offer an adequate amount of light.
1	Way too small returned immediately..
1	These are for giants or are resistance bands (bigger) not loops. They cannot be the same product as in the image because that woman would need to stand with her feet about 4 feet apart to get any resistance from these things.
1	when I ordered the product it was supposed to be delivered 4-5 weeks. Out of no where my mobile so update stated that the product was delivered to California. My adress is in New York . I attempted to contact the seller I never received a reply after talking with amazon they also could not get a reply and refunded my money because of a-z guarantee. They are currently under investigation.
1	Doesn’t work the mosquitoes still bite me with the bracelets so I want my money
1	It arrived open and un sealed!!
1	The Seller “Save Right” sent me a watch that appeared to have already been opened and returned... the box was damaged and looked old. I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt so tried to charge it but it soon became clear the watch had previously been returned because it doesn’t work! Make sure you’re buying from a reputable seller! This one stinks!
1	arrived in time and as expected, but the problem was that it worked for the first day or two just fine, but now it's doesn't respond or move. I tried messing with the device settings on my computer but I can't seem to get it to work again. something in the connection got messed up I think it's sending the wrong signals to the receiver but idk how to fix, so 1 star. i suppose this could happen to any wireless device but it's a shame I'm just ganna have to get a different one
1	The key lock corroded within a week and now the racks are stuck to the top of my Jeep. Since I was traveling for a weekend and didn't want to hear the loud whistling sounds coming from the racks for my 8 hour trip, I had to break them off. Would not recommend.
1	The product worked one time and will not work or charge now I’m very unhappy about it
1	Do not buy this product. Both of them, boxes were open, one of box looks like someone used several. Boxes were not closed or sealed.
1	Like some other reviewers, I bought these for the Zeiss name, but they don't live up to it at all. Left my lenses foggy and streaky. Throwing them out since they can't be returned.
1	Looks like ba friggin clown wig! Arrived frizzy like someone already tried wearing it! No.
1	This is the second book in the series. I read them out of order,however, the really made no difference. All three books are basically the same... You read one and done. I skipped over a bit of this one. There is a lot of weird sex stuff in these books... Thrusting, groaning, moaning, blah, blah, blah. Sorry holly this book was crap.
1	These do not work as advertised , you can put them in the sun every two days and still they do not help remove any smells .
1	The quality was similar to an iPhone 2. Couldn't believe how horrible the picture was.
1	Lost code and company did n help me me obtain another replacement
1	They are cute in the pictures, but when I opened the box, the wood shelves were broken off the screws and I couldn't fix them because part of the wood was glued around the screw. The other shelf had screws missing. The wood is more like pressed wood. I would not recommend this item.
1	This was awful. I returned it.
1	Received and lm sending it right back. It’s lopsided, shelves don’t stay on,the main dividers don’t fit in the base correctly! Don’t waste your time! If I could give it no stars I would.
1	Gave my yorkie a horrible rash. Disappointing. He wasnt comfortable in it at all...
1	Product arrived without the screws to put it together. We have called the hotline several times. You have to leave a message. No one has called back. Waiting to know what to do about it.
1	We rubbed and rubbed and rubbed!!! Took a long time to get on a clean wall. So frustrating. Does not look the best when finally done. Great saying but I lost my kindness during the process.
1	I never received my items and not only that only got a partial refund of my money back
1	Never got it and they had to issue me a refund
1	Was very excited to have found these online as 3 yo birthday party was being planned. Went to have them filled at the local party store THE DAY BEFORE THE PARTY and the seals were too low for them to even get filled. So, now had to put out more money for something already purchased and have to await refund after having to ship them back after the holiday weekend. Very frustrating and makes for an unhappy grandma.
1	We could not get these to work with our TV. They would only work for radio reception.
1	The shirt ran small. I have been trying to return it since I bought it in August. The seller has not responded to any of my inquiries. Do not buy from this company!
1	I installed this pump in my Motorhome soon after delivery and it did operate well and was fairly quiet. We didn’t use the Motorhome until two months later. Two days out, the motor in the pump burned out. I would not recommend this pump.
1	We bought the 3 pack and none of them work. When you plug them in it shows it’s charging and then it quits working. Worked for one day only! Defective
1	Never received them very disappointed they was a gift for my kids
1	The app wouldn’t work try several times they need to send back get it right from company I return it
1	Looks good but interferes with the right bumper button function. Per your instructions, I confirmed I did order the correct version for my controller but this didn't seem to fit correctly.
1	The zipper broke after 2 uses. A total disappointment.
1	Bed had chemical smell when first opened the packaging. 4 weeks later it stills smells. It's to big to box up for a return so at this point it's a loss. Don't waste your time or money it's cheap for a reason.
1	Love the look of the product but it will be returned as it is way too small. Asian sizes are mot well suited to Americans.
1	At first, everything was working great and I had no complaints. After 6 months, it doesn't connect to the internet anymore. Are you freaking kidding me?
1	They sent me the wrong product. Bummer
1	That watch I never fine the way to work, ask me for change my phone number plus I have to paid for returns
1	Very cheap and flimsy. It didn’t last for an hour
1	Way too big. Hated it
1	THIS PRODUCT IS FAKE. I am a substitute teacher and I discovered scentsy products in classrooms I taught in. I loved it because the whole room would smell so good and the wax cube would last for days! This product has hardly any scent and it burns quickly. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER. IT IS A RIP OFF. Look for the real deal because they are amazing. I'm buying from a teacher that sells them legit.
1	Boring. All court legal stuff. Got half way ...gave up. Donated to library.
1	Selected one case and was sent another one. Contacted customer service and the rep argued with me refused to send the correct one or refund my money. Will NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN RUDE!!!!
1	Absolutely disgusting! One of the pairs is obviously used probably from a previous return. Look at the photo. That’s how it came. And it smelled horrible!
1	Mmmmmm. Not nice I said glass cleaner
1	I never received my bracelet. Where is my order?
1	These started out great- connected seamlessly to my phone. Upon first extended use, however, the right ear bud stopped working after about 90 minutes. I tried reconnecting and nothing fixed the problem. Any advice on how to get more than one use out of these would be greatly appreciated.
1	Horrible underwear!! My boys keep sliding through. Every time I wore this, I had to force them up though my pant's pocket. I don't recommend this to anyone.
1	Used the product before and it works great - would give 5 stars for that but the seller shipped it in a large envelope instead of a box. Since it had no protection, it exploded in the package. Very disappointing
1	I have never written a negative review for any item I have purchased however the quality of this phone case is so poor that it was cracked when it arrived and I returned the product to get another one and I have never received a replacement. The color and style of case are wonderful however if it is crumbling apart then it can’t protect anything.
1	This coffee maker has many issues. I have been doing French press for years. I just imagined that all the drip coffee makers would have a timer. If I have to be there to start it I might as well do French press right? I know that’s my fault to a degree. But the next problem is the pot and the lid. What kind of certifiable lunatic would make the pot so it won’t fit if the lid is on? So when you are done brewing I guess you have to immediately discard the rinds or just let it drip everywhere. It would also be nice if I could fit my hand in the pot to clean it. I by no means have giant hands. I just bought this and used it twice and I already have great disdain for this product imagine this will be exacerbated with time.
1	Worse pills they don’t work made my milk tasted bad. My baby dint want my milk no more
1	Cheaply made, not worth the money.
1	I never received my item.
1	Hello i received the product without the hose.never received the 100 foot hose
1	Are used it for crackhead yes they do help but they break very fast
1	I was really disappointed. The cover is very flimsy. It will not stand up.
1	Never received didnt realize it until they were asking for a review and never recalled seeing it.
1	They came with an expired date. Couldn’t return because I threw the shipping box away. Be sure to check the date before you dispose of the shipping box. I’m stuck now
1	This is the worst product ever tastes like plastic very disappointing
1	It was way to small for my 3 year old granddaughter you can't even get the over her head
1	Terrible. Never showed up
1	The umbrella no longer stands up straight. It broke within 2 uses and is now useless.
1	Will not stick to windows at all! I have cleaned my windows thoroughly also have clean the backside of the clings and they fall off within a few minutes no matter how many times I've applied put pressure it just will not stay. Unfortunately they only give you 30 days to return but took forever to get to me so by time I wanted to return I am out of the return window.
1	Not a great buy for my 3 year old. Volume wouldn't stay low no matter what we tried
1	I do not like this it's hair falls off and the helmet hair Is even worse. The hammer is so hard to put into his hands. It is very big. Bought this for my son and he did not like it at all. Returning this.
1	I could not figure out how to play this game. It kept freezing every 5 seconds.
1	One of the snap locking handles on the top of the box broke on the 3rd or 4th time I used it. I now have to tape closed that side. Product is not very sturdy! I have other locking plastic containers like (Sterilite brand) that are 2 years+ old.
1	It never was delivered.
1	I’m lost phone has weak signal , hardly can use never had this issue before
1	It is deceiving in that it did not come with the portable charger and cord as it advertises. We were thoroughly disappointed when the package came and that was missing. The whole point of my 10 year old son wanting the backpack was for that reason. That being said, if you like the backpack the. You will be happy. My son has been in school for 2 months and no damages from the backpack can be sighted.
1	33 with 7 kidney stones to date. This pill didn't do anything and my doctors just shook their head when i mentioned it. Does not digest well. Check your stool for floating yellowish white balls, it is the pill!
1	Received product Jan 29 and already I have to change batteries on both remotes. Car computer telling me to change them. I think they should last at least a year.
1	This is metal and hard to maneuver on your face
1	They didn’t even send the right seeds
1	Did not help with mice at all.
1	Ordered the original tube and received strawberry lip balm. Very disappointed :(
1	The top of the burner is a light weight plastic and isn't even strong enough to hold the incense up right.
1	This popsocket is NOT holo! It's a picture of something holo printed on plain glossy paper. My daughter was very disappointed, and we waited extra long for this to be delivered (we expected that part based on the delivery date stated) just because it was supposed to be holo.
1	I only got 3. It said 5 on the description.
1	I can't imagine how anybody would give this thing a 5 star review, it was terrible. Even at the lowest resolution setting the refresh rate of the video is about every three seconds. It's very fiddly to get the picture to focus and having to weight a few seconds after each adjustment makes for a very long and frustrating process. If you increase the resolution of the picture the refresh rate lengthens exponentially. I'm guessing that every previous reviewer was paid by the company to write each glowing review. I disagree totally with all of them. I returning this cheap chinese junk.
1	Fit well, worked fine for a few months, now dead.
1	Material is not strong enough. My 1 year old cat chewed through it completely.
1	Poor quality and performance. Is very finicky have to fiddle with it to make it work and lightning port will not hold cable so very hard to charge.
1	Purchased these boots last year and went through Amazon for the price, which was about $75. Loved them...they were cute and fit nicely. But they are no longer wearable as the sole of the boot has pulled away from the base (right boot only). I do not believe that this is an authentic UGG product and believe I purchased a knock-off. It's too late for a refund, obviously. Just wanted to post my displeasure and my disappointment that Amazon is unable to curtail counterfeit dealers.
1	Cheap. Broke really easy. Half of them were broken when I received them
1	Box came cut open. Took 3 days to get here after ordering... had to drive 30 minutes to get the food from the store instead since I had to throw out this bag..
1	Super bent when I got it and a diamond fell off. It wasn't wrapped safely
1	Says delivered, to a parcel locker...somewhere? No address given, no key, no info. Was NOT delivered to me. People were home, this was not even attempted to be delivered.
1	Received the wrong product, had to return and wait for refund to turn around and hope that I receive the unicorn as ordered originally
1	I really didn’t feel a difference in my pain level unfortunately. Everyone is different though maybe I just need a higher dose. The flavor is great they are appealing because of the colored bears too. But a tad bit too sugar coated. Which can be a bit messy then sticky
1	Extremely disappointed-absolutely NO coconut flavor-will NEVER buy again
1	Broken out of the box, customer support was of no use. Just use a regular controller instead
1	This thing sucks. It has no distance what so ever, and it's flimsy construction. Don't bother.
1	Worst product ever it does not works pump does not works as supposed to. Have try to reinstall many times and it does not works.
1	I ordered this for my significant other for Christmas. The box was broken when it came in. The screws were all there, but inside the box also appeared deformed.
1	Weak. Lethargic. Serious bass buzz. No. Fail.
1	Adhesive isn't that great, and keeps repeatedly popping off my phone.
1	Worked okay, but is very hard to clean the window.
1	Loved these until after a few wears they tore open near the pocket. Thankfully I heard my keys falling and did not lose them.
1	I followed the size chart and it was still small ::(
1	Got this in the mail a few months ago. Unboxed it yesterday after coming back from overseas and it was defective. Batteries were changed out and it still did not work.
1	Never purchased this
1	I put this on my expensive pop and it scratched the paint of the crease of the box. so not happy
1	I know it's tough, but do spend $20+ more on a better battery that will charge; hunt eBay if need be. Don't waste your time with trying to use that stupid warranty, by that time you have paid to ship it to them, most likely, and they sent it back, you won't be able to send it back to Amazon.
1	Item came broken and smashed.
1	Doesn't work to prevent algae!!!!!!!!!! Very upset
1	While the band is comfortable and easy to install, it's not durable at all. The adjustment notches started to rip after only 6 months of use. Not worth the price your pay.
1	It was too hard and uncomfortable. I have used other old fashioned kinds before and found them to be more comfortable.
1	The blower is ok, but the weed eater is terrible. Do not buy an auto feed weed eater
1	These were so small and cheap. I had hoped to use them for a project, but they're tiny and there's not enough.
1	Extremely dirty right out of the package. Surface of side A has several "pits" in the pressing. I enclosed images of the surface for consideration. I am rating at one star due to the poor pressing quality. As others have mentioned, if you get a clean copy you'll be listening to some of the best music ever recorded. Returned album to Amazon.
1	This was easy to install, no messy grease. But as far as the heat transfer its not that good. I used this on a 3 fan water cooler after I put my mother board in a new case. I replaced it with Artic Silver 5 after a few days and now its running about 10° cooler.
1	Waste of time and money. I bought 2 of these lights and both times it only came working half way. they already send it to you mended and soldered. Save yourself some headache and AVOID at all costs.
1	We’ve had ours for a little around a month and the black strip that is holding the top to the base is fraying and breaking. Other than that it does keep everything cold for a long time! Update.. the underside of the top completely busted this didn’t last long at all 😡
1	One of the spotlights was damaged when they arrived this afternoon. Very, very disappointed. With that said, I have no idea what they will look like if I can't use them.
1	Within 3 minutes of receiving email confirmation of successful setup, I received the first low battery notification. Off to a disappointing start, but will update review after a few weeks of use. Update July 2019: Failed when we needed it most. Despite a relatively new battery and monthly check-ins, it never triggered an alarm when there was an actual leak. The entire bottom of the cabinet was soaked and the leak detector was found floating in it... useless.
1	I bought this at the end of June. Amazon will only take it back in the first 30 days. I only used it 4 or 5 times, and it quit working. I was told to call the manufacture. So I called on November 4, 2018 and was told it was most likely a fuse, and have STILL not received the fuse to fix it. So I called today and they needed the name of the person I talked to in NOVEMBER!! So after researching that I was told "she no longer works here". Then I was told to take the unit APART and take a picture and send it to this woman's cell phone?? In all my years I have NEVER heard of a policy like this. So make sure you look at the replacement/return policy. I have ALWAYS had good luck with Amazon, but I will NEVER buy this BRAND again.
1	Came leaking and messy
1	Second time trying another back brace, doesn't work. Still allows me to stay in the wrong posture and if i tighten it too much, it just hurts my armpit. Awful.
1	I would not recommend this product. The cover was way too small and the flimsy zip broke. We had to put it together with safety pins.
1	I emailed them to ask if it will work on Verizon they never emailed me back . I decided to order it since it says fully unlocked but it’s a big lie it did not work on Verizon just a waste of time and I’ve been waiting for my refund for a week now and I didn’t get it yet ! So disappointment!
1	Died after a year of very very light use, not worth it look elsewhere.
1	I bought these a couple of months ago and left a poor review, but I wanted to trust that the box I got back then was a fluke. It was not. Again, the sausages were rock hard and more suitable for missiles than a dog treat, which really disappoints me. There will not be a third time buying these.
1	Very small. I ordered one higher number for my 7 years daughter. It was small and hardly fit to her. I bought this for her birthday. We used this dress only for one day. Bit disappointing, after spending this much money, we could able to use this product only for one day.
1	Breadcrumbs were opened and all over my box.
1	These are junk! Both bulbs have burned out within a two month period!! I cannot believe that this company can be in business with such poor quality. I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.
1	No work for my apple device
1	Dislike :( It leaks and I do not know where. I looked but I couldn't find it so I got fed up with it. I use it with a Spray Bottle now. For $30.00 it wasn't worth it.
1	I would use this Hub every day for work, and it suddenly stopped working. Do not purchase
1	Did not work when I got it and they won’t let me return it
1	I disliked the keyboard very hard for me to type and it kept dropping my wi-fi, so I returned it and am going to try an 11” this time
1	Complete waste of money. Problems with sound within 4 weeks of purchase.
1	Did not smell the way I expected. The scent did not last long at all. Will not purchase again.
1	Ratchet didn't work. Not the best quality
1	This is nothing like the Happy Color I have on my phone. Was hoping to use on Kindle to see numbers better but there is a kinda grid background that makes anything hard to see. Bummer for sight-impaired people.
1	Beware: scratches very easily, and has a lot of give on the sides makes the case feel like it isn't very well put together
1	While slept on, the wheels came off.
1	When it finally arrived, nothing was labeled, so I have no idea what I planted. Also no instructions on planting. Hope I put them in right side up? Mailing Labels on the box were all in Chinese. No help there.
1	Gap in the new part when assembled. Tried to resolve the issue with Black path through email, sending requested photos, etc. Stopped hearing back from them after 3rd email or so. Finally just returned it. I've seen since other buyers have the same comment about it not fitting.
1	Does not motion sense, app does not pick up once doorbell rings, spend more to get what you want. This product does not work
1	Hair lasted one event before it was tangled and matted waste of money for a overpriced synthetic wig that you can only use once
1	Cute lamp but lamp shade looked like it was defective. Special shade would be hard to replace.
1	Worst chair Ever, Came with uneven screws but fixed it somehow, Now its been only 4 months, chair is not unstable, makes annoying noise when someone sits on it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CHAIR. What a waste of money.
1	Terrible! I couldn't get it off of my lips, teeth, or face!
1	Broken after 1 year of light use, doesn't pressurize anymore.
1	....like just about every other page!! I couldn't believe when I started reading this (with Book 1) and around the fifth chapter, things started feeling freaky. Dialog didn't continue, descriptions faltered, and why? Because every other page was missing. When I checked the other books in the bundle, the same thing occurred. Unfortunately, there's no way that I can find to complain about this to anyone at Amazon. I tried re-downloading, but as I 'm in the midst of another bundle (and this is the first time this has happened since I bought the kindle) I haven't checked to see what's what yet. I will edit this review with an update when I have done so.
1	Did not fit and one of the straps detached when trying it on.
1	I bought the dinosaur Onsie for a bar crawl that I'm going to and all of the girls that I'm going with got a dinosaur one, and they gave me the WRONG ONSIE!! I would return it but I don't have time to return it and get a Jew one before the crawl, so now I'm stuck with a unicorn one. I wouldn't recommend this item. >:(
1	Bought this for my 10 year old son’s birthday. It broke within one hour. It just stopped moving. To send it back Is at the customer’s expense, almost as much as the cost of the product. No thanks.
1	This shirt does NOT fit true to size at all. I ordered a LARGE which is what I typically wear, but this definitely does not fit like a large! I always fit in a large, but this shirt is tight on me.
1	Threw them away after failing to protect crust.
1	Okay so I know $15 is not a lot to spend but this thing is really cheap. I didn't have super high expectations but I figured it was something that you know I could really just place my pocket watches in and even display them in my closet. I decided to return this for two reasons one it really feels like somebody took cardboard and painted over it and then number two it arrived without the insert. What a letdown!
1	THIS BROKE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. I love the design but within a couple hours it was deflated. I inflated it back up again and clearly it was broken. Now, I have a broken pool toy, threw out the box because I bought it over a month ago and just put tin the water. so disappointed. cheap product
1	Beware of this cheap tape birch look.. beware of this product
1	Not enough feet for pricing
1	It is so hot!!! My mother can’t hold it with hands. When I tried I was angry I was deceived by this product.... it is not functional at all. Double layer doesn’t function at all and it was gift to my mother so I didn’t return it but really upset about this product. Hot hot hot
1	Seat is really wide. Seat Material is soft vinyl gets very hot from sun and doesn’t breathe. Springs suspension is ok, better off with a lever action suspension seat post.
1	Very small does not fit my sink
1	Just received this rosehip oil and unfortunately it smells like rancid fish oil supplements. The smell is noxious when opening the bottle, but I tried some on my hand to see if the odor would possibly dissipate. Very wishful thinking as I smell like dead fish and it has been over 30 mins. Very disappointed.
1	The undersides of the papers were surrounded with mold. MOLD. The irony of the statement on the front with the mold on the back is appalling. Straight into the trash.
1	This doesn't fit my Keurig coffee machine when it says it does!! I want my money back!!!
1	Product was easy to install but was useless after. We got this to keep an eye on our house while we were away and as soon as we left our WiFi area..,there was no signal at al. We were gone for a week and had no way to resolve the issue!! Very disappointing!!
1	Was polyester, would not recommend
1	They didn't fit my frame so mad right now
1	No matter how long you use the profile editor it won’t work. It will always make you use default and that barely works. Very bad
1	Box was full of broken glass. I could hear pieces before I even opened it. They are not packed to protect them at the manufacturer. Set up return same day and bought different glasses.
1	Didn't charge my stylus at all
1	Do not order from this seller. Return policy is not in customer favor. If they dont fit your stuck with the item.
1	I bought it to make into necklaces for my jewelry. It looks disgustingly gaudy. Big mistake. Looks like what you’d buy from gumball machines!
1	This does not work and I am the exact skin and hair type they say it will work on.
1	never received this product
1	Very very small item
1	This was never shipped to me so I have no idea how it works.
1	I thought this was the same as the authentic stuff I had but it is not! It smells about the same but I ran out of it in like 2 weeks (the same size in the other lasted me 6 months) this was a watered down version and did NOT work the same either!!! I was SO sad!!!
1	Dont buy from this company, late shipping. .
1	I liked the covers but they reeked of mold and mildew. Trying to return them but it says non returnable.
1	I really liked the product and used it everyday. I liked the fact that it was portable and I traveled with it often. However, I purchased it in August and it did not last until the end of October.
1	I recieved the bag and it was empty but they told me they couldn't replace I just want the ring.
1	Love the product but sellers need to pack it properly. One bottle's cap was destroyed and the product was all over the box and the other bottles. I lost about 50% of the product in one bottle so instead of a deal, this turned out to be an expensive item. Simple fix - tape the tops down. Wrap vertically - not horizontally.
1	They arrived very hard and only one of them was soft still I don’t know if this was a defect.
1	Randomly super loud static sounds. Thought it was my cable and bought a new one-but no, its the amp. I have to turn it off all the time, then turn it back on to get the attic to go away. Just missed the return window. I'm stuck with it.
1	If I could give it a zero star I would. False advertising....advertised as a 3 pack....but you only get one. BIG RIPOFF! !! Returning this. Buyer beware
1	The can was leaking in the package lost at least a third of the product poor Packaging would not order again
1	Do not get these headsets!!!! I bought them the end of October. I am a light user but they are already not working. First the left speaker quit. And now they are alternating between the left and right not working. I can be talking on them and have it suddenly switch the ear I am hearing out of at any one moment. Very disturbing. And.....I cannot find company information to see about a replacement. Too much money for 5-1/2 months of little use.
1	Went to unzip the pants and the zipper broke. Did not even try them on because of this.
1	I ordered and paid for two sets of soaps but only received one set. Are you sending the second set separately? I need them ASAP as they are part of a Christmas present.
1	I returned this because it was horribly slow, even with new batteries. It barely frothed 1% milk, so I doubt it would froth regular milk or creamer which is thicker.
1	I ordered 3 bottles. One is leaking and damaged box. I'd like one bottle replaced please
1	Never arrived and seller never responded. Had to request a refund from amazon.
1	Soon as I plugged it in my iPhone 7 Plus it last about a minute then shut off. My phone it is not compatible with device. Tried it several times and same result.
1	It came broken! The cover was put on backwards and you cannot take off the framed corner pieces to fix it. We had everyone at the beach for fathers day and couldn't play the game. Disappointing..
1	I specifically asked for carmine red and instead got a different color. It’s just frustrating to now have to do the extra work of packaging, returning, and hopefully I get the correct wallet. Clearly the label is correct on the box except for the item. Pretty sad
1	I am not too happy. It only stays if I put 1 sponge but not 2. It falls.
1	DO NOT BUY! A waste of money. DOES NOT work. DOES NOT HEAT. And much smaller than what it looks on Amazon. TRULY! does not work and does not heat, and for cool it is just a small fan.
1	First time using the elastic band it broke.. I used other similar products that lasted over a year.
1	Awful...leg of tripod broke off when first trying ti move it...also shutter does not work.
1	I thought this would be a card like a credit card style. NOPE! its a piece of paper laminated. Then cut and the lamination is not fully melted together in spots. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1	My one star is for the service but not the phone itself, as I still think the phone is a great phone. I ordered the phone and received the box with only the booklet, charger and earphones, but no actual phone. It was quite an unexpected hassle to get the refund as I could not get a replacement. Maybe it was stolen, maybe it was not placed in the box to begin with, honestly I do not know.
1	repeatedly placing cell phone in stand causes the pads to slip, leaving a sticky trail that after a while, acts like glue, because more and more of it will appear. Had to yank phone free every time. Even glu gone wouldn't get rid of it. Trying to push it back in place only worked for the feet. It ended up in the give-away bag for charity.
1	The material is trash
1	Didn’t do what it says it does. Didn’t find any relief
1	I was very disappointed in this product. Opened it on Monday and although I closed it after examining it, it was almost completely dried out within 24 hours and it did not draw the lines as advertised. Glad i didn't spend much on it cuz it was a waste. 🤨
1	Well, at best it's ok. The stand could be redesigned to move the monitor back about 6 inches from your face. This is big - too big and too "in your face" with any normal depth desk. horrible, horrible IPS glow. IN all fairness it is hard to get a pic of IPS glow but this is the best I can get. The center part should be black so the corners will be slightly dimmer than the mustard color in the pic - but size and position of it is accurate. This one is going back- I hope the replacement is better but I am not confident in it. For $1,200 this should be greatly reduced and WTH is up with the flip-phone sounding speakers it has? Gaming is ok on it, but it is nice for desktop space for multiple applications. so it gets 2 stars.
1	This mug was sent with no protection and in a thin mailer. Horrible. Came instantly broken into pieces.
1	Way too big! Didn’t even test the lights due to product not being true to size. I ordered a 13 in kinds it was more like a 3!
1	Doesn’t stay on more then 30 minutes
1	Does not perform as advertised. Cannot run even 250w max charger.
1	Cheaply made. Not durable. Would not recommend for the money.
1	I bought the tracker about a month ago and loved it initially. Nice looking, helpful to have the movement reminders, innovative charging design. However, when it hit one month of ownership the unit would no longer charge and there for is totally useless. At the rate of $30 for one month, not a great deal.
1	DOES NOT WORK AT ALL
1	Most of the utensils looked good but the wire wisk handle came apart when using it the first time. Not worth a penny.
1	Does not work. Do not buy. All the reviews are fake.
1	It doesn’t look at the picture at all and all it did was hurt my head
1	I've been drinking these for years. When they changed the formula, it ADDED SUGAR, tastes WORSE, AND often LEAKS. Totally unacceptable, especially for how expensive these are. I've called Gevalia numerous times to try and explain why then need to go back. Seems EVERYONE liked the old formula better. And it was healthier for you. FAIL!
1	The rose gold practically rubbed/wore off within the first 2 days of wearing it.
1	Container was cut open and packing tape shoved in the bottom. Unacceptable!
1	These fairy lights first appeared to be just what I wanted, but as soon as I VERY CAREFULLY began to unwind the string from the pallet, the lights stopped working. There was a break in the copper wire between the first set of lights. Disappointed.
1	WILL NEVER BY IT AGAN
1	Not as pictured at all. So short it doesn't even come down to my belly button.
1	The balloon came with a hole
1	Very chemically smell, didn’t really see it helped my skin any.
1	Do not waste your money. It falls apart every time I try to use it. Very cheap plastic. Tip pops right off if any pressure is applied to it.
1	Very unhappy. Arrived on time and packaged nicely. Went to use it today for a photo shoot and the garland was completely knotted/tangled and after an hour of trying I ended up cutting the string entirely and just using the balls which is not what the original intention was.
1	One of the shams came defective. Quality control did not worked here. Either replace or refund.
1	Did not do anything for me. No difference
1	The club is excellent. Amazon’s order handling was terrible. Can’t be trusted to deliver expensive items consistently. Customer service on follow up was mostly helpless
1	Bought this hose because the review stated it was very durable that you can even run a car over it without damage. The first time we tried to use it, we screwed a spray nozzle onto it, turned on the water and the connector stayed in the nozzle but came off the hose. As if it was not crimped to the hose. Customer service gave us a runaround, and stopped answering our emails! We were extremely disappointed with the defective product, but mostly the Customer service. Would never buy anything from this company again!
1	Didn’t work and I was supposed to receive a new one but never did
1	the material was not anything I expected...the stitching was not good. the bust was so revealing...just was not pleased at all...
1	It doesn't work after a few time used
1	No valve just a plastic box feel ripped off.
1	My son hated it. It almost rubs up against his armpits. Hes just learning to walk
1	Package arrived on time. We got the cheaper one that had been opened before. It had some dings in it which we expected for the lower price. What we didn’t expect was that we were missing one of the pivot balls needed for installation. We ended up going to Home Depot and used two pieces of PVC caps to remedy that. Now the bottom piece won’t stay in place while in the pool. Still working on this project so we can actually use this ladder. Amazon offered a 5 dollar credit for next order and also to send it back to order a new one. We threw away the boxes and didn’t want the hassle of sending back. We would not order this again.
1	didn't pair...returned it
1	The plastic box that holds the kitty was broken and busted up. The kitty inside the broken box was in half with parts loose and falling out. Deplorable presentation for a gift to my son. Poor quality control.
1	Cartridges did not properly snap into the printer and I was unable to use them.
1	poor product does not dry ,....does not harden like it should . mixed 50/50 filled product. 5 days later. still sticky and soft. does not work
1	If I am not mistaken I ordered tan/beige and was delivered a white one. I don’t want to waste the time by sending it back. I will use it but I’m very disappointed. This is the first time Amazon has let me down and I’m not real happy about it.
1	I have not received the item. Transaction is telling me delivered, but i have not received the item. Samsung Galaxy S8 charger...
1	Doesn't work at all!!!!
1	Has been in use for several weeks and has not trapped anything.
1	The heater doesn't work at all, the water is ice cold. I did everything the instructions says and water won't heat up
1	I would give it no stars. Worst stapler I have ever purchased. You have to push down several times to get it to staple, have the time it messes up and you have to remove staple and re-staple pages.
1	I went through 2 of them just to get them not to crack. Very sensitive glass protector. Hope this 3rd one holds up until I get a new one!
1	No mixing sticker on back
1	I’m a healthy middle age female and I think future buyers should know this bubble style opening system is hard to use. If I was older or had joint issues I’d never get these compartments open. I have a daily routine for meds and vitamins so I bought this to keep me organized all week instead of doing the sorting every day. ... unless it gets easier I will definitely be looking to replace this soon!
1	I thought I'd done all the research before dropping $150 on this thing, but it turns out that it doesn't work with G-Sync monitors. At all. So now I have an opened item I can't return to Amazon, and I'm just hoping the company will answer my email about a refund. Beyond that, what kind of "dock" doesn't supply power to the laptop? That's not a dock, it's just yet another peripheral I've got to plug in when I take my work laptop home. Useless.
1	You should not sell this item ,it is trash
1	Its so sticky! My son is obsessed with play doh but when he plays with this stuff i basically have to scrub his hands and change his clothes when hes done. He likes to put it on his little cars and i have to scrub those to get it off. Just go to the store and buy it. This stuff is weird!
1	Lasted about 5 minutes before water got into the battery compartment and view finder.
1	two of 4 cameras never worked tried to work thru complaint channels and direct email with no response! since received no one has ever responded from direct email or amazon email! Just went to ask for return and see there was a closed return window! Will take up with credit card and amazon direct since have proof of contact.
1	Worst pillow ever, felt like hard foam. My return was accepted, but don't make the same mistake as me. This is not usable!
1	I buy Sally Hansen Products locally ALL THE TIME, this bottle was shaped differently and although it was sealed, the polish peeled and chipped immediately. I have never experienced this with any Sally Hansen products. It didn't even smell the same. I believe this is no name polish with a Sally Hansen label on it. I would not recommend this item from this seller.
1	Cracked when I installed it
1	I good case, solidly built, but the black glossy paint started to flake off within less than 1 year. I ordered another one which only lasted 3 months. I suggest the manufacturer get a better adhesion for the finish. It’s a shame because if it was not for the paint peeling off, this case would be outstanding as it does protect the phone well and fits tightly.
1	Doesn’t fit properly for the freemie system. Too long and milk starts to suck back up and through tubbing.
1	You're paying for the name and that's about it. You can pick a pair of these up from the dollar store
1	Way too hard to setup so I returned it.
1	one of them quit working without reason! worked for a while then stopped!
1	Ripped the first day I got it!!! Now it has a big hole in it!!! Cheap!!
1	It’s the perfect size for my ear and it’s very shiny! The packing was good. Each earring is in its own baggie. Update - the jewels fell off and I found 2 in my ear. Glad they didn't get lodged more into my ear..
1	Didn't fit any bottle we own.
1	Ordered these twice, both times didn't receive the size I ordered. Twice returned. Too bad because I loved the shoe
1	I’m sorry I cannot try the shoes since Amazon Logistics Epic Fail! Item never delivered, and denial of Amazon on providing a proof of delivery. No refund nor the willingness to deliver. Amazon indicates to send an email to their Customer Service with a proof of non reception from The Freight forwarder, but no reply after 4 times no reply at all. Not buying again from Amazon!
1	I ordered the iPhone x case and I got this. I order on Amazon often and this is the first time anything like this has ever happened
1	Worst thing I have ever purchased. Tuned pool green and had to replace with Sand 3 weeks after opening my pool. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!
1	I recieved the wrong coin. It was for 4 years not 33. This was a commemorative coin for a special occasion. Now i have to apologize to that person for recieving the wrong coin.
1	Did not like it at all, no chapter, no paragraphs - did not like it at all.
1	not worth it at all...wasn't worth the $ poor quality item
1	this product is not working dnt buy, waste of money
1	Not worth the money. Only a handful of moss. Couldnt use it.
1	the plastic container cam broken. overall not happy with the product. it works fine.
1	Dont buy..the faucet has a small and everytime you turn it on it has sediment.had a plumber come out and they said it's the faucet..called the company and they said deal with amazon. Read Amazon rules and cant return.
1	I bought a dollar store ovulation test and it said the test line needs to be as dark or darker than the control line. It was lighter so instead of buying a ton of dollar ones I bought this pack since you are suppose to test daily till it’s positive. I’ve never seen a second line with any of these tests.
1	Bad condition. Ripped cover and dirty.
1	Ordered, only received the bar no weights, useless
1	Erratic operation. Works, doesn't work, works one side or the other. Trashed.
1	This book was one of the worst reads I have ever experienced. The writing was infantile and uninteresting.
1	Battery did not work, did try with another battery and the light works fine, but battery doesnt work!
1	Very poor craftsmanship. The finished edge of the top sheet was puckered all across the top, so that it would always twist, and look and feel awful.
1	I just opened my package and went to apply the tempered glass like I have done on many devices. I went to pull the tab to remove the protective film before applying it to my device and there was NO plastic film. I checked the second one in the package and found the very same thing. Just a peel tab stuck directly to the tempered glass it self. Very Unhappy with the product quality!
1	i got hurt while trying to put it together. would not use outdoor. its not stable at all. it might get the job done.
1	I threw the garbage grinder away because all it does is squeak and it doesn't even grind half of the time 0/10
1	not ordered by me....ordered by my grand daughter
1	Don't get this dress. Not only is the sizing off, well everything about it is off. The material is that paper-like itchy material, it's not long or flowey like the model, the sleeves are this weird Shakespeare-like resemblance, it's clearly not a legit company that makes this dress but rather a knock-off somewhere in China. I should've paid attention to the reviews. Take my advice and avoid because the company will Not refund all your money.
1	Product says 2, 12 feet hoses but they are maybe 5 feet each at best. Returning and now a day behind schedule. I'm annoyed .
1	Boring and confusing. I can't imagine a movie. It is a short volume and I still couldn't plod through it.
1	I order hundreds of items from amazon every year and usually leave no reviews, but I am compelled to write about this item. As other mentioned, the glass is extremely thin and feels like it will crack at any point. The metal cover doesnt sit securely on the glass and it feels like there should be another piece holding the metal to the glass, otherwise if you lift the lid, the entire contraption lifts up. If the teapot is anywhere 3/4 full or more - watch out because it will leak no matter how hard you try. It feels like the good reviews either received another item or are fake.
1	This thing....doesn't suck. It wouldn't even pick a cobweb off the wall. It won't pick up dog hair off of linoleum. Sent it back had a refund immediately. Read the other reviews and belive me they are right! Super disappointed.
1	I've had this item for 3 days and the cheap plastic literally already snapped. What a fricken waste of 20$, so upsetting.
1	This was supposed to be a baby shower gift to a new gamer dad. Got the absolute WRONG shirt. This is not what I ordered.
1	Extremely disappointed as this gift that I purchased for my daughter for Christmas, was dirty and had food (or what looked like food) stuck in the blender attachment. What's even worse is my daughter just opened the blender this weekend to use for a recipe, so it's already passed the return window. Won't be buying from this company again in the future!
1	I've been doing nails for a while now. I ordered this set of 2 top coats because I had run out of the one I was using. Once I opened them, they were very, very thick. They were the same consistency of builder gel and not a gel polish at all. It was very hard to get out of the bottle with the brush. It also goes on very thick so getting an even coat is difficult. It was not left out in the sun or even anywhere very bright.
1	One of worst products I purchased from Amazon. Battery can hold for less than 30 minutes.
1	I read many good reviews so decided to give it a try. I received the pillow well packaged and sealed air tight. Once released I expected it to reach fullness-firmness. Once I laid on it it did not feel firm nor did I feel it supported my back or belly. Not sure if the packaging is what took away the firmness of it or I just got a defective pillow.
1	The courier/delivery person marked this item as delivered , yet I never received my package. This seems to be a recurring issue with Amazon.
1	Piece of crap. when trying to pick a pet every button did the same thing and no way to pick a pet.
1	This thing is worthless. Between the motor and the scent cartridge paid over $200 and barely smells. DONT BUY AND DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID
1	Would give zero if could cannot get it to sync with supplier not enough options. Misleading that it can stand alone on fire tv. Very disappointed
1	The plastic on the side came off
1	The back started to peel off after only a few months use. It bubbled and keeps coming off in pieces. It has not been wet at all so there's no reason it should peel off other than poor quality.
1	This did not fit my phone. My phone is an 8plus as advertised and it didn’t come near to fitting. Disappointed.
1	I sent this to my daughter and it showed up in the manufacturer’s box!!! No Amazon box at all!!!! Needless to say, I am furious!
1	If you like manipulative men, weak women, and pain driven sex, then this book is for you. This in my opinion is not in any way romantic.
1	Of the 4 cartridges I received, 3 would not seat properly in my printer. I pulled out my HP 902XL cartridges out of my reserve stock and they seated perfectly, so it wasn't a printer or user issue.
1	I have fine wavy hair with a course texture (unusual I know). I thought with all the good reviews it would be worth spending a little extra money to get a nice product for my hair. I have been disappointed with it- for my hair it doesn’t really do anything for it. When I wear my hair naturally wavy/curly it doesn’t do anything & when I blow dry it & wear it straight it doesn’t do anything for it. I actually rather use my cheap garnish fructis hair product over this. I was surprised given this was one of the top hair products rated on amazon.. maybe it is just my hair type? Really though it does nothing for my hair- wish I could return it.
1	As others have noted, production is flawed. Terribly sharp edges. I hoped this problem had been remedied by now. Nope. Stay away.
1	Reformulated in Jan 2018 - horrible. Super runny, no lather. Seems like a ploy to get you to use 2-3x as much product each wash as it just flops everywhere when you try and squeeze a little amount out. My breakouts are back to what there were before. The old formula had pretty much cleared me up. One week with this new one and I’m back to being self-conscious again. I’m going to scour local drugstores for the old version and if I can’t find it, switch brands.
1	Loved The texture. But The quantity is a fraud! And you cant even open it to see The real quantity. Its like they sold me “air” only few splashes came out
1	Did not work for me.
1	These are fine for a photoshoot but definitely can't be worn even for a party. The wax molding doesn't even stick to the grillz
1	This product seems like a cheap marker. I feel like I could take my crayola markers and get a better line. It definitely stays on and won't come off but doing second coats for a bolder look or correction don't really work. I also store it with the point facing down and still don't get enough out of the tip. I thought I'd try it for the price and unfortunately it just didn't work for me.
1	These things are cheap cheap cheap. The plastic is terrible, the mold they used is terrible, the straws literally fall apart inside the bottle. I suggest getting legit ones from a supply company.
1	Do not waste your money bought this for my husband as a birthday gift will not even inflate a tire hose has defect and hoes will not retract and it does not appear that parts are available to repair and the warranty is a big joke
1	Unfortunately this product just didn’t work for me. The item required 2.4 speed, my Modem is 3.0 but couldn’t find the smart plug, Disappointed.
1	I have ordered this before and haven’t had this happen!
1	The case is of decent quality but its so smooth and Im constantly having to make sure it does not slip out of my hands. Not sure if this is something that goes away but Im very unhappy with the case and will be returning it. My husband got the black case and it has a slight rubber texture and its great but unfortunately the mint color is slippery as all get out.
1	I failed to read the other reviews. I used the hardware that came with the towel bar because...it came with the towel bar.The screw does not fit the anchor. Long story short, I now have a dime sized hole in my wall where the anchor pushed through the drywall when I was trying to get the screw in. I already put all 7 anchors in so I am pretty pissed right now. As you can see from the pictures, I couldn't even get the screw out of the anchor, I had to pull the entire thing out of the wall.
1	I bought this to replace my current case that has broken. This one doesn't fit my computer well at all and the keyboard cover is stiff and doesn't fit on the keys and is a weird texture and falls over way too easily. It makes it harder to type instead of easier. It isn't very expensive and thats clear with what you get but the one I had before from a different seller cost less and was way better. Don't waste money on this. It couldn't be worse honestly.
1	My pit was able to break this within 2 days! Not durable enough.
1	Terrible quality. It's milky and won't mix but won't settle either. Can't blow any bubbles at all. My kitten is disappointed each time she sees the bottle. Won't buy again!
1	It appears that some people are receiving a different item than others. I specifically purchased these hats because the photos people were posting in their reviews showed the hat with the little logo on it, and that is what I was looking for. The hats I received have no logo. I am not sure why two different products are being sent out - zero quality control!
1	When I first started to use these I loved them because of the length, until they broke. Both the 10 ft and the 6 ft cords broke within three months of use. One wire shorted out and the plastic connector on the second one just fell off. I will go back to Monoprice for my cords, they never fail.
1	Was very disappointed with this recipe book. Most of the recipes you have to use their flour that you have to make from this book.
1	Dose not work at all. If you want it so you can drool all over then it works otherwise makes snoring worse. Wakes you up coking. So save your money.
1	This product was a waste of my money, battery life was okay the first month then no good. The pairing of device was not so easy, staying connected to phone is not as good either!!!
1	Had 2 months and the strap broke
1	This product is shown on a flat dashboard. Even turning it to face you as far as it can go, the phone is still pointed at the car ceiling.
1	Does not work. Hardly shows up even on my pale skin. Hardly gives a tan.
1	This makes the British look like scared fools. And, my grandfather was no liberal coward.
1	I was hoping for shine as it showed in the photo, but, the stuff put a dull coat on my counters. back it went.
1	I got a box full of oak, just oak. waste of money
1	I had this bench for 3 months in my shower and it loosened up very bad. I re-tightened the bolts and within a week it just broke in pieces.
1	Poor handling. One of the cartridge was leaking right out of the box.
1	This cable is not working and unsupported to device. Waste money
1	First time out with this and both keeper pins fell out and strap fell off.
1	Cannot rate this at this point. Never received it. They took my money but no product.
1	The phone had faulty battery that doesn't keep charge. I want to return it.
1	DO NOT order from this company. They will continue to charge you. They charged me for a second shipping that I never ordered or received. The 12 people that rated this are probably friends of theirs. VERY disappointed to have to deal with another scam
1	This is not Kenneth E. Hagin, the son keeps copying his wring style and probably using his notes.
1	Cheap and took a long time to receive
1	Would give 0 stars if possible. Bought this for my niece and would never give such a hunk of junk as a gift. It was advertised as Sterling silver and nowhere on the package or item say's 925. Very disappointed. I ordered a beautiful silver necklace and received costume jewelry. I've already started the return process
1	Doesn't fit the models listed
1	The point protectors were poorly made out of a hard plastic. They do not stay on needles, bamboo or aluminum letting my knitting fall off! If your only looking for the stitch markers then go for it but I bet you could get them cheaper.
1	I ordered this for my son who requested this and it was snug at a Large, an XL would not be trimmed to his waist. His big complaint was not that, but of the odor, the smell off the fabric. Sadly, we are returning it.
1	Can’t believe Amazon would put a piece of garbage like this on there site. Totally does not work
1	bag could not stand one flight from the scrap of Angeles to St. Petersburg, the fabric on the hard ribs burst with overload, the plastic parts were deformed. it's impossible to use the second time. would like to return the money
1	Died on the first day. (Christmas)
1	This is not what I wanted. I wanted a foam visor. This one is Styrofoam. It was not at all clear in the description and I would send it back but it was cheap and I’m lazy.
1	Received my laptop with damaged.
1	Did not fit. One size does not fit all. You need a better description of this product on line.
1	I bought this as I travel for work. I sleep in it one night a week. I am barely 300 for a 350 weight limit chair. Didn't even last 4 months. Complete waste of money. Not to mention the physical damage to me when it collapsed!
1	Love the look but not good quality. The 1st one I ordered arrived broken. Got a replacement and it only lasted about 2 months. The return period is closed and now I'm stuck with two pieces of marble. 😠
1	Worked great for about 6 weeks and now no longer heats and too late to return .
1	Review is solely based on installation. This is HORRIBLE. I have never owned a portable unit before and the instructions are horrible to follow. Panels are only designed for a certain length window and won’t customize to your window height. Ridiculous!
1	this is not worth the time or money. my air does not cool in the dead of summer here in FL any longer. Toyota (2) of them and the same results in both of them.
1	For the price I paid for these gloves they definitely are not worth it after two days of using them two of the fingers ripped and they’re just made of thin material there supposed to help keep your hands warm but they don’t . I would not recommend these gloves to anybody!!!
1	Like others that have posted reviews of this item here, I also received a unit with a Ni-Mh battery instead of the OEM Li-Ion battery. A 2 hour run time is advertised with the correct battery, but with the Ni-Mh I was lucky to see 30 minutes of use. Charging takes an extremely long time, and concerns of an electrical short or excessive heat from the incorrect battery have come up as well. The Roomba itself is great, but a lack of acceptable customer support in replacing the battery ruined the chance I was going to give this product. When I contacted iRobot to seek assistance, the product I received has been used by 6 different customers and has been registered for 3 years.
1	It would not stay attached to the tv, the next day, it was hanging off of the tv. I had to use take to hold it which is not what I was expected.
1	Even with zip ties on the connections and keeping water at a very low pressure, the hoses come off with the water flow. I gave it my best shot to like the product, but heavily disappointed.
1	Did not get is order
1	This is very cheap looking. I expected something sturdy.
1	the box does not show that it is compatible with Samsung and I could not get it to work
1	Item was very attractive..but did not work properly .. very disappointed !!!
1	Too many ads. Won't let me purchase ad free for some reason. Also, any offshoot of the games and extra purchases can run up to 100 dollars!!
1	Battery terminal had powder leftover from corroded batteries and wouldn't even power on. I second the statement "certified refurbished" by whom?
1	I ignored the negative reviews on this because we had lifeproof cases for our s5's but I wish I would have listened. This one had the camera lens piece fall out while I was cleaning it and I was not pushing hard. My husbands broke where the charger door closes. I would not recommend these even if you have liked the product in the past.
1	Very disappointed with this noise machine. Only got it playing a couple of times. I’ve changed batteries, checked connections and turned off and on. I gave up!! Another $30 down the drain 😕
1	So hard to open, way too big, does not shut easily. Too bad I did not use it until it was too late to return.....
1	I bought this 16 hours ago, for $16, after having it in my cart for over a month. I wake up and today I see the price has dropped 5 dollars. I hate price fluctuations like that, and I feel every such price change, done with no warning, no ability to predict or prepare for it, and which, in a situation like this, grossly takes advantage of people who made a purchase RIGHT BEFORE such a change, are impetus enough to never purchase a product from a particular company again. I live on a budget. $5 changes in prices in what I buy add up, and quickly. I am absolutely disgusted. If I felt I could do so without the appearance of abusing Amazon return policy, I would demand a full refund and return the product, when it arrives next Friday. This is infuriating. As is, I will use it when it arrives, but no matter how well it works, I will not adjust my ratings. I will only ever purchase, in the future, from a company that I do not feel is taking advantage of it's customers.
1	Also, their return policy is dubious.
1	Damaged or rough on the metal, and slightly bent, these should be checked before the get sent out. The gun is chipping and cracked.
1	I’m very careful with my phone and have it in a case knowing that I cracked both protectors with in a couple weeks of each other. My previous protector from another manufacturer lasted at least a year. Won’t purchase again.
1	Not bright at all. P O S
1	Are those real bluetooth ? I just received one and I have to plug in to my phone in order to connect bluetooth. if it has bluetooth connection, why I have to plug it in to my phone all the time to stay connect? If I have to plug it in to my phone, what is different from regular earphone? As there is no Q & A to ask a question to the seller, i have to put a equation here. To Seller: can you response my question ASAP?
1	I missed one CD and I could never finished the course!
1	Arrived broken. They shipped it knowing it was broken as they packed the broken pump top separately
1	I went through almost all 6 in less than 2 weeks. Lifted very easy, does not hold up against normal use. I purchased a different brand, IQ shield, it has lasted so far over a month and haven't needed to replace that one yet. I would advise against this brand
1	Not really a good tool to urinate standing up for women unless you pull your pants down or you are wearing a very big pair of sweats or something like that. I got this thinking I could use it to go into a urinal. I'd just get a regular urinal and just make a snug fit with my own doing.
1	Seller did not send all aspects. Only sent nipples and no spare parts
1	This product was a complete waste of money. It doesn't work as intended and there is little support to get it up and running properly.
1	Did nothing for night glare. Waste of money.
1	Amazon is a horrible company. And it reflects on their selection. I am giving up trying to solve issues with them. If you have any chance get this item somewhere else DO IT!
1	it only works sometimes when I hold it at a certain angle
1	Lasted 5 weeks before one of the tightening Buckles busted off. Our dog is only 60 pounds so that was unfortunate.
1	I have used this on my kid who has a problem with pot. I know he smoked a day or two before I tested him, but there was a faint line. The faq says that even a faint line is a negative. Was not accurate in this case.
1	I did NOT get the green ones
1	Absolute piece of junk. Display is so dim you can't read it, but that's not too important since it doesn't work at all to begin with. I finally got the metronome feature to work, but that's not what I bought this for. Waste of money.
1	This stuff is useless. More like an attractant than a repellant. Just use deet.
1	I’ll start with why I gave it one star; the case doesn’t allow the sound to get through adequately. You can hear people on speakerphone or other but your voice is muffled even if you’re talking with your mouth right up to the microphone opening. I would not recommend this product unless it was re-designed. It’s made well maybe it would be waterproof I don’t know. Everything fits together well it’s just the sound is awful
1	These are by far the worst plates I ever saw. Quality is horrible and the plates are poorly made not worth the money you pay.
1	One press and the handles deformed. Couldn’t use it again even after bending it back, it wouldn’t line up.
1	This product has changed since I started using it, it was oily, actually separated into an oily goo when I squeezed it out. Very disappointing. I threw it away and changed to Covergirl.
1	These leggings are cheap! I could see the second I took them out of the package that they were thin and see through. Also, the inside didn't have any fleece or even fuzziness.
1	Sizing is way off, its a guessing game to find shoes that fit. There is no help with sizing, no contact info for the seller and it doesn't seem like they can be reached. Terrible buying experience, would give 0 stars if I could.
1	Very angry I received the DVD to only find out that it cannot be played in my region - so if you knew it can’t be played in Australia why send it??? I have wasted my money as it will cost me too much to return 😫
1	The table came with multiple broken pieces and imperfections on the table top due to screws underneath. I contacted Amazon and JOOLA but no one felt compelled to show strong customer service. Completely not impressed.
1	Junk. Every time the phone falls a short distance the protector falls off. The last time it broke from a 1.5 ft fall.
1	Very bad cookware set. Nowhere near non stick product. Used for several months and very disappointed. Would like very must to receive a refund....Horrible!!!
1	They may have been 1500 thread count as stated, looked great before washing. Afterwards they were rough and thinner. I could have gotten something of this poor quality for a third of the price locally but wanted a better product so I ordered these on line. Price was great for what they were supposed to be, not for what they ended up being after washing.
1	This story is a good one . However delving into t the sexual episodes occurring between the characters is and was not necessary to make a good story . Once Taylor and Zeke got back together it was sex sex sex on practically every other page this is not necessary for a good novel too graphic. No I do not recommend this is a good read for my friends . Sorry
1	Loved this little machine. It replaced a Keurig - I hated the taste of the pod coffee. I love using freshly ground beans in the Ninja. The controls are simple and clearly labeled and the machine is easy to operate. The milk frother is easy to operate and clean. The large travel mug is useful for brewing two cups of coffee. The 4 oz setting with frothed milk is almost a real latte! The machine does not use a lot of counter space. And the price is very reasonable. However!!!! After less than 12 months of use, the water container cracked, the drip stop leaks, the clean light turns on weekly, and a significant amount of liquid remains in the filter after the machine beeps.
1	We still have not received our order. When message for an update they said didnt have a tracking number. Told us to wait a few more days
1	I loved the look of this band but unfortunately it has a cheap clasp and I lost my entire Fitbit!
1	Only lasted 2 months. Not worth buying
1	Is this product one that just can't be shipped?
1	The bluetooth is defective on the unit we received.
1	All the paint discs had fallen out of the container when this arrived.
1	did not received yet Victor
1	The film simply blamed this young woman for men raping and mistreating her. The woman did not cheat on any one but was sexually free and she is demonized for it while no accountability is being passed to the men who were in relationships, in power, or who raped her. The movie only shows her as one dimensional and viewers have little info about how or why she is in the predicament that she's in. This movie is disgusting. Very poorly done. Seems like the writer has a personal problem with Nichole that maybe he should try to resolve. Smh
1	Item arrived tangled and defective. I couldn’t get pass the untangling, so I will be returning this product unfortunately.
1	the divits in the stick are so shallow they barely make any sound. Poor product
1	This DOES NOT fit a 36 x 36 table. I have just spent 25 minutes trying to make it fit and it does not fit. I tried putting it in the dryer, as suggested to make it more maleable, but that was a waste of electricity. I bought two....what a waste of money!
1	Wrong item sent, I don't trust them enough to order it again
1	Warning: even though the button turns the power on, the switch has some resistance. If I connect the switch to my raspberry pi and turn it on there's not enough power coming out to keep the raspberry pi working but when I connect any other cable it works fine. I have another button by a different seller that works fine.
1	Only able to wear 2 or 3 times before all socks lost shape and would not stay up.
1	Lasted less than two months before fast charging capability did not work. No way to contact the seller to get a replacement. Do not recommend this
1	These are likely the cheapest nylons I have ever worn. They come in a two pack- the first pair tore (not just ran, but full on tore) while putting them on... I figured they snagged on my ring or nail or something and put on the second pair.... .....which legit tore WHILE I WAS WALKING! Top of the thigh tore at the seam and the toe shredded. It was absolutely CRAZY! Sad. But save yourself the embarrassing moments and buy something of quality!
1	Skip these and go to a Starbucks instead and have one made. The powdered coffee mix packets are just not very tasty in my opinion. I love Starbucks too. Sorry.
1	Not good for fat people
1	Very nice looking but I have to keep rubbing them down everyday
1	They sent a completely different pair of pants. They sent gray jeans. I wanted to return them but it would cost me over 30 dollars to send them back! Terrible!!!
1	This pole saw is extremely unbalanced. It is very difficult to use when attached to the pole. The saw does cut well for an electric chainsaw. My biggest complaint is this thing is a nasty mess. It constantly leaks a pool of oil all over anything around. I have oil stains on my workbench in the back of my truck in my driveway due to the leaky nasty mess this thing creates. If this thing was not such a pain to repackage I would be sending it back. I am very displeased with this purchase. The third time I used this the chain broke and flailed around. I was cutting a 1” branch when this happened. Yes, it did cut my hand. This product has no business being sold.
1	It’s a clip on frame for your watch. That’s it. Not a screen protector at all. I had mine less than a day and it popped off. Now I have no idea where it is.
1	Worst purchase I have made on Amazon
1	Literally broke and does not work - if anything shows up in a horrible tint. I want a refund but can't get in contact with them
1	I recon I'm not the only one who got shafted . Terrible seller not to highlight that it's just a soundtrack.
1	Does not work for my iPhone x. Would like my money back
1	If you order an Ocean Blue speaker and care that it's actually Ocean Blue, do not order through Amazon. Amazon will send you the regular Blue speaker at least three times in 30 days after customer support people place new orders for you with manual instructions specifically highlighting the color selection. The second and third regular blue speakers also arrived scuffed. Come on, Amazon. I recommend Walmart.
1	Very disappointed. Wish I would have spent the extra money on a better quality pillow, or purchased locally where I could have checked them out first. These pillows are shipped in a vacuum sealed bag and are completely flat, flatter than your average pancake. No amount of of fluffing them will get them to puff up nicely. I believe it’s the combination of too little poor quality fill, combined with the vacuum sealing. They’ll serve the purpose, but not as well as I anticipated or desired. I would not ever buy these or this brand again.
1	This is the worst!! All paints were completely dried out!
1	These shoes are for sitting only. Every step you take you can feel the heel bending in. Super cute but god are they uncomfortable.
1	Product might work if the mouse went in, but unfortunately that doesn't happen...
1	I ordered the wrong part
1	As soon as I opened it, I didn’t like it because the product looks old and used and rusted. I decided to give it a try but it took like half an hour to heat up . In addition to it , I don’t like the curling iron. It doesn’t curl at all . Straightener is good though. I am returning the item.
1	This was an “Amazon Choice” item. I ordered July 4, 2019. Latest delivery date was Aug. 15th. I waited a week and still didn’t receive it. Amazon message says it’s not covered by A to Z guarantee. Now waiting for reply from vendor. Low satisfaction on ratings. Spend a couple bucks more and get it delivered.
1	Purchased in January 2018 and it is already broken (April 2018). No longer charges and no longer turns on. I will be returning for a refund.
1	Junk. This has a small strip of adhesive around the edges. It bounces when you try to type.
1	Sent back because it didnt seem to fit. And hurt my thumb.
1	These dental chews made our 4 month old, 6 lb Schnoodle throw up. I contacted Merrick and was told they are not suitable for puppies. But there are no warnings about that on the bag, they are selling it as it is suitable for all dogs.
1	Bought this seven months ago and use it only occasionally when traveling. Bad surprise, it just stopped working without any warning. Tried it on another surface, same result. It's a shame since the design is great and it would work overseas.
1	Clock was fine for a while now it just stopped working for no reason
1	Will not buy again 1st cable didn't even and 2nd cable stopped working a month after purchase. I couldn't return because return deadline had passed
1	I don't know how it works, because I didn't get to use it. The box was wet on my porch, and inside the bottle of stability was cracked around the bottom edge and had leaked out. Very tired of getting wasted/damaged products from poor shipping practices by Amazon! Amazon should be refunding these things, but they don't seem to care.
1	Leaving my package 📦 outside my door I do not like I just order a blow dryer and now it’s gone cause somebody done took it off my porch if I’m not home can you just take it back to the post office
1	Does not work at all with my iPhone 8. Waste of money. Worthless.
1	They sent me the wrong item.
1	Delivered broken in 2 places
1	They were not delivered next Day.
1	Poorly made. Built in China. Very poor product
1	These are the worst leggings I have ever bought. They fit absolutely terrible and they are the worst purchase I have made on amazon by far
1	Super thin and hard. Could barely carve.
1	Didn't even shop up. Was refunded after a week and then the order was cancelled. I love amazon but I was dissapointed.
1	I am upset. The paella pan has two large dents in it.
1	Help me to understand why I paid for bags of gummy worms that only had one or two worms in a lot of the bags? Complete rip off!
1	The material on the exterior feels cheap and not what I expected. I order the extra large striped bags and got these instead. Returning as soon as possible.
1	Fell apart after first use
1	I got this scooter bc I read on the reviews that it came with a helmet! What a disappointment for the price to get this and not see the helmet in the box - and the face of the birthday child when we told her that she couldn't ride it on the road!
1	Didn’t Like the smell at all. I put it on my face but it was way too greasy. I heard that it was good for scars from acne but I wouldn’t recommend if you have oily skin... It really had a fishy scent to it
1	Don't waste your money
1	Container arrived empty. Sealed container was completely empty.
1	gets a little warm but nowhere near 300
1	Washed them upon receipt & they left enough lint in the washer to knit another face cloth size towel. Dried them & used them after a shower and they continued to shed all over me. Very disappointed!
1	It seemed well built but after 20,000 miles you can already hear it growl. Stock wheels and tires
1	I tried to replace the cables my dog had chewed through. I barely got any picture from these cables, flickering on and off. Very disappointed.
1	I give this a 1 star review only because the colors are vibrant, other than that it is VERY lightweight and not what i was expecting to get. Very overpriced for this item. This was going to be a gift for my daughter in law but I am to embarrassed to give it to her.
1	Good idea however, I bought the case and realized that the case will not protect the screen. If you are looking for a battery bank this would work, this will not protect cellphone screen. Be aware that most of the reviews are coming from unverified customers. Be AWARE!!
1	I did not like it at all! I feel like this is counterfeit, it burned my lips. I have the same exact product which is the reason why I purchased this one and I did not feel my lips burning with my previous one.
1	I was adjusting my strap for tightness and the magnet that keeps it closed came right off. I've only had it for 6 days!
1	I dropped my brand new iPhone X on a flat service and the screen shattered. This case is not protective as claimed in the product description.
1	I got the package in good time. I’ve used a screen protector since I bought the phone and thought it was time for an upgrade. Now I’m left wishing I continued to use my old cracked screen protector. The wet and dry wipes meant to clean the screen before you put the protector on both came completely dry. Removing dust/air pockets from this screen protector is a no go. If you try to use a card to push air out of the side air will leak in front the sides, create air bubbles, and never go back down. Don’t waste your money with this, get a screen protector that comes with a mounting bracket and actual cleaning supplies. My biggest regret is even trying to put these screen protectors on because now I can’t return them.
1	One fell on the floor, dog rejected. That's how bad it is
1	Wrong book was sent.
1	There is really no difference with this installed and plugged in or not. It does nothing. Thank you
1	Ordered this back in February. It is now April and after two messages to the seller it has still not arrived.
1	These are very large mouthed straws. I thpught they were regular size, but they are more of a smoothie or larger type of straw. I'm not sure who needs a straw this large.
1	Product does not stay on. Very hard to use.
1	Only came with one threaded rod, send me my parts please!
1	This is my second beef jerky review. Funny this is also the second mistake I made ordering beef jerky that a lot of people have bagged on. I like beef jerky, I like wagyu beef, I like truffles... put this combination together and I thought I would be in hooked, but after trying it I almost had to gag it down it was so awful. No offense to those of you who do enjoy it. I think the texture was spot on. It was not greasy or too hard or too soft. I just found all three flavors horrible. I gave the rest away along with the first batch of beef jerky I reviewed. I unfortunately cannot recommend this. I will keep looking and trying to find that ultimate beef jerky.
1	Trash... it stopped working after a week
1	I never received this product, which is very disappointing. I did receive a refund from Amazon however I would have preferred the product
1	Never received item and seller has stopped responding. Won't be dealing with them again. Buyer beware.
1	No instructions and no heat resistant transfer sheet that you would normally peel off to get the design on right on the shirt. The whole thing melted to my easy press.
1	Although this bag is soft, the fabric is so thin it shows different colored foam that the bag is stuff in. It makes the bag look like there’s stains all over the fabric. Huge Disappointment!! I would not order again.
1	The battery life on these headphones are terrible. They did not even last for hour.
1	Product is good but deliver did not call gate to inform of delivery. We found the box opened outside the gate. Products spilled .
1	They sent me an open box item or the product is different from the picture. There was no cap (handle) part when I open the package.
1	pretty, but broke after using it once.
1	Never did received this item as ordered. Did get my money back from Amazon
1	5 sizes smaller then what your expecting. I ordered an XL adult thinking it would shrink some and end up fitting like a L. Opened it up and it barely fits my size youth 8 very petite daughter. After washing it, it became a cleaning rag. Im not sure my daughters stuffed animals could fit it now.
1	That are junk after five months! What a racket!
1	I have asked to cancel this. I get these ST charges coming up all the time and don't know what they are for. AMAZON HELP....
1	How was this company allowed to even have a 2017 calendar for sale??!! Yes, I should have noticed, but I didn't. Waste of money.
1	My face turned red and burning after I applied it few minutes later. It's really terrible! Want to return it.
1	No words could adequately express the horror. I bought NEW and received STAINED drawers! What is wrong with people...and AMAZON, seriously this is absolutely disgusting and should never never happen. Quality Control needs a lot of improvement! DISGUSTING!
1	Never received package from USPS. Was not in box as reported.
1	It looks like the package wasn't sealed and new. Upon opening, one of the sensors was used with discoloration of the contact area, no cellophane around or factory seal. Hopefully it works at least
1	I ordered two of these and one had no seal at all and the other one had a seal but it was broken. These aren't eligible for return so I'm just out the money on these as I won't use a product that is supposed to have a seal but the seal is missing or broken
1	This product is USED!!! I am returning! Pieces and manuals missing!!!
1	I've had this product about 5 months and it already has problems. I run maybe 3 times a week's and the left earphone makes static noise now. I thought these were sweat resistant.
1	Never received the book!
1	Love mitch but the second CD didn’t work and I didn’t find out until it was too late to return to Amazon and that sucks
1	The watch looked okay but it did not come with a battery so how am I supposed to cut it on it's going back
1	This product would not download properly. After multiple attempts, I had remote help downloading it into my system. However, it created issues with my programs, always stated it was not up to date and needed updating, which always came with a fail message, and the program bugs eventually caused my computer to crash. This happened more than once. After struggling with this program for months to make it work properly, I can say that I would not recommend this product. It does not protect, but only causes system problems.
1	The diamonds have to much dust on them
1	Turned black quickly. Not durable for high heat
1	scatched up my wooden floors
1	From first use, these left tiny black dots all over the area I was blending. I do not recommend these at all!
1	I ordered a different item then what was pictured.
1	Worn once by my child & washed once my me. How is it possible that it has a large hole in it already!?!?! The amount of piling after just 1 wear & wash is ridiculous too! The fit is great & they seem warm, but if they are basically disposable socks, what good are they? Wish I could get a refund. Would not recommend.
1	Terrible screen protector. Firstly it does not fix to the screen properly on the edges and then the screen is not responsive in the middle. Will not recommend this product.
1	Looks nice but Very weak construction, started to breakdown by itself without falling or anything, tried to exchange it but Amazon closed the return window 2 days ago..
1	This stuff was basically a terrible hairspray. Not a good smell, no shine imparted etc. nothing positive to say about it. Wish I’d read that it wasn’t returnable also!
1	The front corners of both cushions ripped at the seams almost immediately after first use. My delay in returning due to busy schedule caused me to miss the return window. While the cushions are comfortable, it would be much more effective if the insides were not coming out.
1	Wish I had read these reviews BEFORE I purchased this. To paraphrase another reviewer here, I have been using bay rum for many years and . . . well, this ain't it. Don't know what it is but it's definitely not the scent of bay rom.
1	Didn’t send me the right brand. Waste of my time and now I have to send it back and wait for a refund. I will not order from this company again
1	Was missing some of the earrings. Didn't get what I paid for.
1	I’m very sad with the quality of this product, is the first time to try to print something. I was so frustrated and all was the filament. The printing look bad, like filled of bubbles and no definition. Is not the money is the frustration. I blame the printer, the calibration of the bed, the temperature. Again. Sad. Nothing else to say.
1	I will not buy this brand again, I was picking out the peanuts (fat).
1	This watch looks like toy watch!! The quality is very bad. The solutions is very low and the screen is hard to touch. It’s very disappointed to me. I can’t buy it again!
1	Returned it. Inner lining is very low quality.
1	Received and installed Sept 1 2018. Today Dec 25th it is leaking from the weep hole!
1	By the 3rd time we used this on our puppy it started completely falling apart where the rubber attaches to the glove. It's junk!
1	If you're OK getting USB components without even the small protection afforded by the involvement of a US company, go for it. Even though China makes most of these items, when they are ordered by an American company and sold to their specs you can expect the device to be a little less likely to contain anything malicious. But when it comes from an unknown company in China, who knows?
1	Smells strongly of chemicals. Glitter flakes off. Very, very stiff -- I returned.
1	Too Big. Did not fit.
1	BEWARE! Bottle arrived with safety seal clearly opened and been used! Not new! Disgusting and unsafe! They won’t refund this product either! Do not trust this company!!!
1	Wrong item sent. Received a pink dinosaur.
1	These Were a Waste Of Time And Expense! They Never Stayed Up And Yes We Followed The Directions!!
1	My family spends most of our summer either at a baseball field or at the beach. We have been using this Coppertone product for years and have been pleased with the results. That all ended with this purchase. When I saw it was cheaper on Amazon than the local store I ordered it. The spray is worthless. We've gotten sunburned both times we used the spray from this order. Threw what was left away and will no longer purchase this product from Amazon. If I could give it zero stars I would.
1	It's a good product it was just way smaller than I thought it would be.
1	We used it for less than a month and it is broken.
1	I never recived this !!!!
1	Arrived broken!! 3rd electronic item I’ve purchased from Amazon, BROKEN. Never again! I have to waste my printer ink & my gas money to drop this off now for a return? 👎🏼 Horrible!
1	They came with 2 holes on the front legs
1	Only one of the charger slots worked when I got it, the front one works but the back one doesn't. Not worth the money.
1	Just unboxed the product and so far the mouse piece fell apart. VGA/HDMI does NOT work!! 2 different pc monitor, a tv, and still no signal. What a waste of time with this product. Garbage!
1	Not for the 2mm shaft size described.
1	I didn't like them, they were jagged around the edges where the moldy seem was and they were narrow and didn't sit right. I got what I paid for though, cheep junk
1	Why would you send these in a little zip lock baggy loose? It was poorly packaged for the price and they almost got lost.
1	Don’t waste your money on these. Extremely thin and cheaply made. Arrived already cracked and damaged. You are better off to spend a little more for a better quality product.
1	Having had good luck with another brand of inexpensive purse on Amazon, was excited to see this handbag arrive. Unfortunately, it is made from extremely thin/cheap material and poorly constructed as well. I observed loose stitches right out of the packaging and the material is very insubstantial. Returning immediately. It's a shame because the "look" of it -size, shape, etc. - is quite attractive in the photo.
1	It is going on 4 WEEKS since I ordered this, says up to 8 weeks total until delivery!!! I needed this weeks ago for my job. Says shipped and I can’t cancel. Must be coming from another country. Yuck. Don’t order!! Ridiculous!!
1	This book takes advantage of the trademarked Weight Watchers and Freestyle program names and buzzwords without adhering to the program guidelines. Some of the recipes can be modified to fit the point values if one uses reduced-fat or fat-free products, but the recipe for 1 pound of bacon used in the "Delicious Chicken BBQ Ranch" recipe definitely does not meet the WW Freestyle program. I gave the book 1 star because of the misleading advertising. However, if one is not following WW, then perhaps the recipes would be of interest. I also gave the product 1 star because it's a self-published book that needs some editorial assistance.
1	The single serve portion splatters coffee everywhere (when it works properly), and will clog up 8 out of 10 times, therefor you have grounds everywhere and it's not easy to clean up.
1	I ordered a small. I received one small and one medium
1	I ordered 2 for my daughters and the one was fine and the other was completely trashed. It is unable to be packaged and shipped back and I can’t take out of the box because the filling is everywhere. I should not be charged for a replacement....see the picture.
1	What I received were not the width nor the length of what I ordered to fit my boots. Very disappointed.
1	Not waterproof at all doesn’t even have liner I was soaked
1	I bought these because I was on a budget and I wanted puppets. The are poorly made. Some of the mouths don’t move correctly. I wanted to sell them, however, my mentor suggested that I could use them as an example for people who may have problems speaking.
1	I bought two of these. One arrived leaking already. I used the second one today which was the second time I used it. It leaked all over my cooler and all of the food and drinks in my cooler making for a rough beach day with three hungry kids. Don’t waste your money or you’ll end up with a mess.
1	Where is my product, i have not recieved it yet?
1	Stopped fast charging my phone literally one day after the return window closed.
1	I bought it, installed in, went on vacation and started using it when I came back. The suction mount is the worst I've seen in a dashcam or any product. It just doesn't stay put. I had to stick it twice a day for a week and every time it would fall with a thud, without any bumps and while it was parked at night. Second, the recording feature is all over the place. I liked their button settings which make sense. But after setting it up, the camera records randomly, says the disk is full (even if it's set on loop recording) and after formatting and changing card, still gives the error. The other day I found a bump on my car and when I checked the camera, NOTHING was recorded in the parking mode. So, I'm past the return window and should have tested it before going for a vacation. Seemed like a good product from the reviews. Maybe I got a bad unit. But in any case, check it if you buy it, but LOOK ELSEWHERE for a reliable unit.
1	I used this on an acoustic guitar and the day I got it it was hard to set it up so it would tune. It keep going light and then dark thought the battery was bad so changed it and problem was the same. Never did get to tune my guitar right . I would not recommend this tuner there are better ones available .
1	Good: I was so happy with the look to the screen protector tiny watch looked so good with the curved black edges around the screen protector. Easy installation. Bad: The screen protector shattered within an hour of putting it on my watch as I was sitting at my desk at work. Product not worth the money, I was very sad.
1	Hated the fact that this product description noted that this product would be bubble free and it is not!! Used up both the protectors bubbled up. Completely unsatisfied!!!
1	I just received the item a few minutes ago and the quality is extremely poor. The mount will NOT fit a phone securely if it is in a very thin case. I will be returning it as soon as I get to a printer
1	Received an order for replacement bottle and 25 bullets and spray bottle did not work. I love my FON but this spray bottle is so cheap.
1	We were disappointed in this story. Young children don’t appreciate slow long drawn out stories. If you are extremely religious perhaps this story is your kind of thing. We felt it was boring, outdated and wordy.
1	Items arrived completely smashed in the box. It was full of broken glass and amazon would not give me a refund without sending the broken pieces back. I did not feel comfortable mailing a broken box full of glass and said no, so will receive no refund.
1	My initial review of this product was denied presumably because it was too honest about their shoddy nature, so I will be as straightforward as I can... I purchased these bulbs for my RV. Within a month several had burned out. They are cheap and I DO NOT recommend them. You can save yourself time and hassle by buying a quality product the first time, i.e. NOT this product. The denial of my initial review stated "Your review should focus on specific features of the product and your experience with it. Feedback on the seller or your shipment experience should be provided at www.amazon.com/feedback.", so I will not discuss my negative interaction with the seller.
1	It would not stop the water. It ran over. Waste of money.
1	Fell off the wall within 24 hours.
1	I received this product with no micro-crystalline probe instead there were 2 large circular probes. I thought maybe they made a mistake so I returned the item and bought a new one thinking they wouldn't make the same mistake twice. Well, I was wrong because they sent me the new suction with no micro-crystalline probe. I have returned both. There are suctions just as good as this one for less money and the arrival of the right product is right the first time. If you don't like playing Russian roulette with your orders then I would suggest going with another brand.
1	Worked for 10 days then it stopped charging. Broken. Dumb.
1	Disappointed, just a regular sock with a design that makes is look like it would provide comfort.
1	This was our first time trying this brand of coconut wraps. We usually use Sun Foods brand. We thought, let’s try these... they are a little bit cheaper. Turns out that decision was a mistake. When I went to request a replacement due to damage... the item does not allow returns (apparently not even for damaged product). Normally I would make an assumption that this was an isolated case. But upon inspection of the packaging, I discovered the plastic is very rigid. So it seems to me that it this may be a common issue. More pliable plastic would have more bend/give rather than just cracking and breaking.
1	bad quality, it stop work in few week. don't waste money
1	Whiskey barrel? It doesn't look anything like it. Plus it's made from cheep plastic. Last and certainly not least, it doesn't have any holes on the bottom. Still deciding if I want to send them back or put them in the back of the back yard.
1	The ear rings came in very cute packaging. But what I’m concerned with is that they are turning black and turning my ears black. I ordered these because it says they are sterling silver so I thought that they wouldn’t turn my ears any color. They are a super cute design but not something I can wear on a regular basis because of the quality.
1	The chair did not have any assembling instructions and no hardware to put together. I saw several comments on how easy it was to assemble, however, it’s hard to try when instructions and parts are not included.
1	The packaging is total different from the one I purchased it doesn't stick to it the instructions are wrong it did not work at all! It doesn't read the finger print
1	Ordered these shirts for a custom tshirt order. Couldn't be more disappointed with recieving an item that looks like mice ate holes in. I'd recommend ordering the ones from hanes.... there was no issue with theirs (they came in the same box)
1	The colors are not as shown, also it starts to peel in one day. I think you get what you pay for so I’m going to try another name brand.
1	I got OtterBox because I thought they would be tougher. One of them broke the 2nd day. On the plus side got them quickly.
1	After one day using it, the hoop will not stay up, keeps falling down..had to use duct tape...Too much money for this to happen.
1	Six of the eight are dead within a month of having them up. Not sure if it is the battery or the solar panel, either way do not buy this.
1	Did not get what was advertised
1	I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT STILL, PLEASE LOCATE IT TO BE DELIVERED TO US.
1	Product looks nothing like advertised photo. I would like to return them and get ones that have more color or just get my money back. Please ans thank you.
1	Received without all the pieces. Also seems used as there is packaging missing and torn. Do not buy.
1	This is what I received. After pulling forever to get it apart it's not what is pictured. It's plastic on plastic. What is pictured is what I need and now it's not eligible to return. Wtf
1	I bought a set that had 2-3 ft, 2-6 ft and 1-10 ft cords. What I received was 2-3 ft, and 3 - 6 ft cords. I was looking forward to the 1 - 10 ft cord to use in my bedroom so my husband could charge his phone when he needed. Now, I do not have it. The other cords all charge, but I still do not have the 10 ft cord.
1	The sound is terrible you can hardly hear anything. I expected a lot more for it being a littman
1	The batch that I received was permanently affixed to the paper backing. When I tried to peel the stickers away nothing but paper came up behind them. Either way, these are probably not ideal to use on a wall. Based on what I saw I'm guessing that even if the stickers did peel off of their backing correctly that they would not be easy to remove from a wall even if you didn't leave them there for very long. I was especially disappointed because the label said this product was made in the U.S.A. - which I would like to support 100%. The alternative product that I ended up using (it is amazing) was made in England.
1	Purchased this showerhead as a replacement for one I purchased a couple years ago This one is identical to the one purchased before....I THOUGHT!! It looks the same but it is NOT the same. I purchased the previous one at a higher end plumbing/fixture store. This one on amazon is made for mass consumption and is not the same quality. the water flow is not as great as the low of my older showerhead even though I removed the water-saver mechanism in the new one. Its a cheaper product. Ended up using the older showerhead.
1	It would be good if not for an annoying problem with the volume As other reviewer note the volume goes from low to high abruptly, sometimes I have to put it very low because if try to raise it turns it very loud So I guess there's a problem with quality control somehow Better avoid the radio and look other alternative
1	Broke after 6 months.
1	Product was open and leaked everywhere
1	Purchased in July 2019, color is peeling off.
1	I tried this several times and nothing was different. Very disappointed after spending $35.
1	Worked great for a little over a month. Now, the end of the arm near where the tablet is held is severely damaged. It will technically still support the tablet since the black portion of the “arm” is very rigid. It’s near the end where it is wrapped in white rubber that uses a smaller type of bendable metal that has broken down. The tablet just kind of dangles now and can’t really be set to view from almost angles. Bummer.
1	Does not work. Error after 1 minute playing
1	Giving this a one star BECAUSE they sent me the wrong item. Very disappointed with this. I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN.
1	Expensive and not functional. I spent a fortune on this product that I didn’t like at all. Please, do not waste your money.
1	I am not new to wall decals, so I am pretty good at mounting them up, and have to say, this was the hardest mounting I've encounter. The transfer sheet was too strong that the letters did not want to come out. The paint on my wall was lifted off on some areas, and I the end I winded up with tore letters,and a damaged wall. I dont recommend anyone to buy this product.
1	This doesn't stay put on the car vent, and struggles to keep a phone in the position. Dispatched into the trash can.
1	My finiky dog (Maltese Mix) wouldn't touch this stuff, I gave it away.
1	Terrible. Not even close to the size that it marked. Will not buy again and definitely do not reccomend.
1	tried it three times and each time it fell off after two or three days
1	It works but you have to go to their poorly coded web page which seems to only record a weeks worth of data. It doesn't connect to any usefull services except a couple that you have to pay for. Regretting spending the money on a device that won't connect to my smart home. Worthless. Every time i try to add a service to push data to, it fails and says my meter is offline for hours to a day. Seems to be broken again. Guess I’ll send another support email in the morning. All my data is missing.
1	If you are looking for a humane, catch and release trap, this may not be the one for you. We caught 2 mice in 2 days, and found them both dead. We are quite certain this was due to suffocation. The location of the air holes gets blocked by the peanut butter (or other bait). And the size of the air holes is clearly not sufficient. Other reviewers here have reported the same problem. The air holes should remain where the bait goes so the mouse can easily smell it. BUT there needs to be ADDITIONAL holes for air exchange in the body of the trap as well. I have contacted the company, and they have promised to look into, and remedy, the situation. But, until they do, I would not recommend this trap. I would recommend looking for the same type of trap, but where the air holes are located in the body of the trap, and NOT just where the bait goes.
1	Item was delivered with barely anything left. I basically got an empty bottle.
1	Bought 2, 1 froze up after 3 months
1	Won’t stick to my phone :( never had an issue with other pop sockets
1	A lot of people had mentioned that it had become a documentary of our times, despite it's humor-based start. That could not be further from the truth. It does live up to its name.
1	This pops right out of the sleeve. Very poor quality
1	Thought when it said mini they would be smaller than what received.
1	Ordered 4 bottles. Received 3 in good shape, but the 4th leaked through the packaging. Post office was not pleased.
1	Very disappointed in this product. The first time I used the oven, the adhesive failed. I followed all instructions. Do not buy.
1	It has already cracked in under a week. Don't waste your money!
1	They broke the first day my students used them.
1	Phone was locked and it's an international phone. Very poor product avoid. Unfortunately Amazon sellers like mine took advantage because they sent to Amazon a faulty phone.
1	I had ordered this before the first customer review. The glass is straight black even though it clearly shows clear glass in the pictures. I either want a refund (including shipping) or a new piece of clear glass.
1	does not work at all returned all of them ,dont need to buy it does not work
1	Recieved a tiny cake pan size. I've ordered before there was no mistake. No response to fix the issue.
1	Keep your money! I bought this so I could check my husbands BP. I took it out of the package, set it up, and took his BP. The sphygmomanometer broke in the first use. I didn’t even get to finish taking his BP. It felt really cheap too. I also didn’t like that I couldn’t hook the sphygmomanometer to the cuff. It is part of the pump.
1	Unless you are 100% 200% that the size you order will fit your foot do not purchase from this company. I ordered 2 pairs trying to get right fit, I love Crocs. Being they don’t offer 1/2 sizes I ordered one pair that was tight around toes and one pair next size up that was slipping on my heals. I lost $20.00 on restock fees and paid for return shipping. Shoes were never wore and returned right after fitting and in perfect condition.
1	Case was broken and worn when I received it in the mail. Not worth the money.
1	Hi, I am upset because the photo shows both the container and the cap in the picture. I expected to receive that. But no, you just get the container and have to pay another 8 dollars to get the cap for it. That is way too much money for such a little part.
1	They suck Evan at 300 degrees it melts shitty bags that I need to throw away almost 30 of them cause they can't handle ever 300 degrees
1	Not impressed. Barely gets warm
1	There is a dead bug inside this case!!! So gross!
1	This was NOT the Muller report at all!! It was the same piece of misrepresentation by Trumps lackey lawyer
1	These people somehow got my number and harassed me to give then a review. How the heck did they get my number that’s creepy. No totally unacceptable
1	Don't waste your money
1	Can’t even review it because they sent me the wrong product. Ordered a black short sleeved dress in size large and received ax XL cold shoulder T-shirt. Not impressed. We’ll see if they screw up the replacement.
1	These are total crap. They stopped working after two weeks.
1	The sparkles are rainbow colored nothing like the pictures
1	I read this book trying to understand where the author was coming from. The fact that Kelly was so upset about Amber being pregnant and posing nude, just didn't make sense to me. Young people mimic what their role models do. Everyone in town knew that Kelly and Mike were SHACKING UP, even the priest that let her sponsor Madison . Then I get to the end of the book and read the sample chapters of a book she recommends . It makes me want to bring back book burning
1	Fake batteries don’t buy them!
1	Faulty part- stopped working after 3 days -
1	Absolute horrible. Tips broke off of all cords within a month.
1	The worst program I have every tried to use. Horrible
1	I bought 4 of these. 2 stopped working after 3 weeks. I emailed the company but they didn't bother to respond. There is a 30 day window to return, but I because I ordered these a week before the phone came, and my boss didn't get switched over right away I missed the window.
1	Don't spend money in this product, Nothing grow in this pipes ,water don't flow and they are so thing that you get green algae, since water don't run !! Now they avoid to return money!!! stay way from this seller !!! Things like that keep me way from on line shoping !!
1	These did not turn on .. need My refund
1	I did not receive the package.
1	My 15 year old lab chewed it down to this in 6 hours.... and be barely has teeth!!! Not sure it’s worth the money. Maybe good for small dogs.
1	First vitamin that effected my stomach and to make things worse I couldn't return
1	Never received the item.
1	After ordering, I immediately onto steam in order to redeem the game. Says it was already activated on a different steam account. I have contacted amazon and will update this review when I get a reply back. Edit 1: I was able to get a refund Edit 2: Once acquiring my refund, I bought it again, hoping I will get a code that has not been redeemed yet. Again, I recieved ad code that has already been redeemed... Looks like I'm contacting amazon again...
1	Poor quality. Very flimsy and magnetic separates easily from the image and foam.
1	I’m pretty sure this is not the original model, break Down after few uses, the charger port doesn’t work anymore. So really dissatisfy
1	Did not read so I cannot give a review
1	Sorry but I didn't find this helpful at all. It provided non valuable minimal repetitive information and was about 4 thin pages. I'll do my own research trial and error in the Hope's I can get some positive credit union results.
1	So bad. I feel like the dishes would’ve been more clean if I used nothing. Dishes came out dirty and filmy every time. Couldn’t even tell if I ran the dishwasher or not and was having to rewash every dish.
1	Not properly packaged. It came in just a plastic bag. Visible scatches and burrs. Grinding works great. Don't send as a gift. Totally unacceptable at this price range compared to others.
1	This product mostly does what it is supposed to: count down time, but... Too many steps to set the timer, too many opportunities to have to start over. I want to enter the time and push start. I do the same time often but if this goes to the clock the timers all zero. You have to go through the long process every time you want to set a timer. I would send it back but I mistakenly assumed that it would work like other timers and tossed the packaging. Best I can do is warn you dear reader. Not useful as a kitchen timer
1	Not good if you plan on getting your Fitbit wet. I wear my Fitbit during aqua aerobics. It just filled with water and clouded my screen. Only way to dry it was to take the bands off, and then take the cover off. Too much trouble so I returned it. Would not recommend.
1	The radio case holder came apart after using the case holder for approximately 21 hours over a period 7 days. Is it possible to return for an exchange?
1	The vinyl melts when pressed on to the shirt, so when you peel the transfer paper off, it stretchs the vinyl because it is stuck.
1	It broke right away and was unfixable
1	I ordered it because I liked the model, I received a round regular ashtray
1	has a weird taste. Packing is different from what I normally order from Fiji website.
1	I got this product for my one year old for her birthday and this buggy is not worth what i paid for it. It is very flimsy and constantly falls apart while she’s pushing it
1	I never received the tape measure, please send! Thanks
1	I swear this made my dark circles WORSE! I can’t believe this works for anyone. I also got red bumps under my eyes afterwards. Might have just had a bad reaction. DONT BUY!
1	Our first bike arrived damaged. After returning the damage bike, the second bike arrived a week later and appeared to be in good condition. Assembly was a challenge as the instructions were blurry, parts were missing, and the tool that was included was not the right size for our bike. But I put it together and the only problem left was the flat front tire. I thought I could fix this by pumping a little air in but no. The stem to the tube was broken off. I had to take the brand new Go Glider bike to a repair shop for them to replace the entire tube in the front tire. The bike repair guy told me stems don’t just break off, it had to be done with some force. So Go Glider had sent me a broken bike. Again. 20 dollars and 20 minutes later (plus one week of you start the clock from the first damages bike we received) this bike is now fixed. But I will never purchase from this company again. And if I had it to do over, I’d GO TO THE LOCAL BIKE SHOP INSTEAD OF WASTING TIME AND MONEY WITH THIS WEAK OPERATION. P.S. My son doesn’t like the bike at all. He wants the balance bike he was riding at the bike shop while we were waiting for the repair! I should have just gone with the experts from the start. Sigh...
1	They sent me the wrong mug and it came broken besides. I ordered a nana mug and received an aunt one. I get AWEFUL. It was my mother’s christmas gift I sent to her house in Texas.
1	The material was cheap looking and it fit me too small. Had to return.
1	Lame. While moderately stylish, it does not glow in the dark. Returned.
1	Wrong color i purchased a silver set i received black also no bracelet unsatisfied with purchase.
1	Worked great and now doesn’t work at all. Only charged it once. Never charged or turned on again.
1	Maybe just me, but I broke both screen savers in a matter of minutes trying to position them correctly on the car's screen. I've put glass screen protectors on my cell phone and tablet with no problems. Not nearly so easy with this product. I could not get the protector squared correctly, nor could I get air bubbles out once it was on the screen halfway square. I do think it would proved great protection if you're not picky about appearances.
1	These Twix bars are produced in the Netherlands; they do not taste the same as US-produced Twix, so if you are expecting the US version, you will be disappointed. The expiration date on the lot I purchased was 2 days after the shipment was delivered.
1	Came in a bag inside a box but half of the liquid had leaked out of bottle.
1	It doesn't work or download any data to the app
1	never received what i ordered, wrong item was sent
1	We received the wrong size. I’m due in 2 weeks and they still haven’t refunded my return that they received in the 10th of January. Hoping i get it before my baby arrives ! It’s kind of Important 😐
1	Not wanting to stay on phone
1	Beware of the misleading information about tis protection plan. They will do everything to get out of actually protecting your product from offering false information from the time that you call to file a claim for a defective product to the time to offering reimbursement. I purchased the protection plan for a defective keyboard and when I called for replacement options, I was initially told that they do not replace items but instead will issue a refund of the full amount to your bank account. Acting on this information, I went ahead to repurchase a new item to "replace" the item since I will be receiving the refund of the value. A couple of days later, I receive a phone call from Asurion changing their statement to state that they would instead offer a gift card instead of refund to my account. When I tried to explain that this defeats the purpose of replacing the item since I would have no use of the gift card, the customer service rep on the phone went ahead to school me on the difference between insurance and protection plans all the while avoiding a key mistake that an employee of theirs made by providing a different information earlier. Its not worth the headache! Choose a different protection plan
1	Actually i didnt want to put no star because i bought it less than one month
1	Never received in the mail tried contacting the seller never heard back from them. It wasn't that much money but that's not the point. Don't waste your money.
1	definitely not happy but too lazy to take apart and return it. it is not worth the price!!!
1	Will not be buying these again. When I walk in them my heels really hurt. I contacted the seller to return my purchase, hopefully I can get my money back. Would not recommend, save your money for a nicer pair of shoes that are comfortable.
1	The controller lasted a couple of days and broke by itself while I was playing GTA 5 and no longer works Also the battery is complete crap and I only get two hours of use out of it
1	Very small. Not easy to clean the silverware holder.
1	Part two disc for the third movie is defective and does not play. How do I get it replaced?
1	Don’t buy. It breaks eventually
1	The cross fell off the necklace the 3rd day my son had it on.
1	DEFINITELY NOT water proof they way they say it it. It kept coming off, I even tried it with a primer and a setting spray and it wiped right off onto my black uniform. And it DEFINITELY DOES NOT come out of black clothing. I had to spent $80 on a new uniform shirt thanks to this crap.
1	Product came with just the cat mug... no soil or seeds.... very sad
1	Not a very sturdy case. I loved the design on the case so I bought it. But had I realized the 2 parts are separate I would not have purchased it. Sorta wish I had sent it back.
1	Did not absorb at all! Pet urine just laid on top.
1	I bought this to use in my salon. After about a month it stopped charging. Of course I had thrown the box away. The cord works, tried on a coworkers shaver... but mine won't charge anymore, and I had bought 2 additional heads to go to it
1	With shipping and tax ,this cost me almost $30, for the most awful muffin I've ever had in my life... incredibly salty (despite no added salt to the mix), bitter, mushy texture.
1	Very cheap material. I would not buy again!
1	Weighs WAY too much, or clip isn't strong/big enough. I couldn't get this to stay on my head for the life of me! Very cute, but I'll be sending it back
1	Complete junk the grill protective lining comes off as you clean it. Dangerous for your health
1	My unit broke after the first use
1	first time ordered they only sent chair no cords. The next time they sent just the car cord, 3rd and 4th time they sent wrong model cord. I eventually had to buy a 12 volt to ac converter to get it to work. After all that they did give me a refund.
1	Requested a return twice, still no response.
1	Not the same look as advertised
1	Very uncomfortable to wear.
1	Lots of leaky tubes don't waste your money.
1	It was ripped apart. I need it the pages that day, so I could not return it. It seems that others has the same problem
1	it does not keep all the steps you take maybe half
1	Snug fit. Red one fit remote perfectly but the blue one's holes were off. Silicone is very thick which makes the buttons inset deep so it feels odd when pushing them.
1	We have always used Bambo diapers and never had a rash but lately the pull-ups are too big in his waist and they're leaking. So we tried these bc they're organic and he got what looked like a bad rash/chemical burn within 2 night or using only for bedtime.
1	I got 10 pages in and had to quit. I don’t like quitting books- but this book was horribly written and had so many run on sentences....I have no idea who allowed this to be published this way. Seemed more like a first draft.
1	iPhone 7 not compatible with this product. Wouldn’t allow us to use it at all.
1	the lights is not even working.!!!
1	We were very disappointed with this product and plan to return it. Neither of us is a train hobbyist; we purchased this to put on a table top around a small Christmas tree. Parts were broken, misaligned, and did not easily 'push' together. The notes below detail these issues. 1. One of the linkage bars on the train engine was not attached to the main drive wheel and just flopped around. Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track. In several cased I had to use the tip of a knife to lift the metal clip up into place while pushing everything together.
1	Got a smaller bag than what I paid for
1	I didn't get a full refund.. it's nothing at all like the photo
1	I wish I could give it zero stars. Not because of the hair but their shipping practices. The first order I never received my hair. I spoke to Amazon who told me they would give me a refund and then to go ahead reorder the hair, select expedited and you will get it on Friday - this was thursday when I called. Did all that and as soon as i clicked buy, it shows as arrival date MONDAY... How? How is my arrival date monday when the rep told me it would be here on Friday. Mind you I have an appointment on Saturday and ordered the FIRST hair Saturday evening - the first hair was supposed to arrive on the 31st. No communication from the seller or Amazon regarding any delays. So here it is Thursday and here it is nothing. My event on Sunday, hair appointment on Saturday and now I'm scrambling.
1	This product did nothing for the inflammation in my knees. Maybe my symptoms are to far gone.
1	That were the wrong ones they said they would fit not so !!!
1	Way to skinny. Returned it as soon as I opened to package.
1	does not always enable.
1	I didn't use it for a couple months, then when I was on a trip at the beach the moment I opened it to put my phone it, the plastic that locks the top ask keeps the water out broke. I was unable to use it and take the picture I wanted.
1	Worked ok for less than a year. Then the quality was terrible - volume would go down so low that I couldn't hear, coming up periodically for no particular reason.
1	I only got 2 cubes instead of 3 and they have stickers which they’re not supposed to
1	A white van leaves packages on porch in plain view, it would take two seconds to put packages behind chairs or behind bushes so the thieves can’t see them, Very poor delivery service,
1	Does not work at all my phone shattered and I've had it on my phone for a few days . Disappointed.
1	I wore this pretty much constantly until today. I sat down & the case fell off. It ripped on the top of the belt loop. I had not noticed any problems before. It "looked" to be a good, sturdy case. I was sadly mistaken. I would have returned it for a replacement but I'm out of time since January. Buyer beware, looks are deceiving.
1	It says in the title 25-30 and there is MAYBE 10 in there. It was put in the mailbox while I was at work, even tho I requested it to stay at post office, and all of them were dead. NO where on the box did it say live bugs! It also says in the description that these are smaller ones because they’re meant to grow, but a few were absolutely huge. Will not be ordering again. Rip off.
1	Glass is too thick and bulky. Literally hurt my fingers I had depressed so hard. Got 2 but can't use them
1	NOT a G note. Tuner reads it vacillating between E and B and doesn’t even sound good at those notes. One star was generous.
1	This is not rose gold. It's clear... It looks nothing like the picture Seriously it's clear,n
1	Small and cheap looking.
1	Will not stick to screen being repaired
1	There was a hole In the item received
1	Absolutely awful. These are meant for children. I am 5’2” and while I have a little junk I’m in no way big. I couldn’t even get them over my thighs. These also had a run in them. 😑 Annoying
1	After few days the shampoo dispenser started to leak by the pump
1	If I could give it zero stars I would. DOESN'T WORK
1	Amazon does not stand behind plants and mine was apart inside the box and dead. Do not buy live plants from amazon.
1	Stopped working after 3 months
1	Stopped working within two days
1	I was excited to get these as I was tired of having a gross rubbery mat, and these are really cute. I dried the tub thoroughly, then cleaned the tub with alcohol. Once that was dry I applied the stickers. After only 2 showers they were sliding and I almost fell. Absolute flop and now a waste of time and money.
1	This product did not give us good results. I don’t feel it phased the moles at all. Those little guys are resilient! But....what made the mole leave in no time at all was...dryer sheets!!! Stuff a dryer sheet down the hole, and cover! I was amazed!!
1	Pretty disappointed when it arrived. The wig looked nothing like the picture and was pretty shiny.
1	Straight trash. Like others have stated, it does not adhere to the edge of device, this after trying multiple methods. Additionally, even in the parts it does stick to, it has a clarity issue to where the screen loses some of its luster.
1	Received on August 2nd and they are already breaking down. The wires are already coming apart and not charging my cell phone. Very disappointed!
1	Only had them for a few days and they are already tarnishing.
1	Bottle is great. Company is annoying for emailing you until you leave a review. So here it is.
1	the first time I rode my bike with this tube I got a flat tire.
1	I never received the item. Contacted seller requesting shipping information to track item; however it was never provided. The seller stated they would look into it but a week later, no response.
1	product did not work. return, one month later still haven’t got my refund. don’t buy it
1	I paid for 2 day shipping. My items arrived in multiples packages and I never recieved the bodysuit! So disappointed!!!!
1	This bra was way too large and bulky on me. I followed the size guide.
1	**UPDATE: the other sole blew out on me after 4 months. I'm having to use gorilla glue to salvage these shoes until I buy a new pair** These are not for wide feet. My little toe is not a fan. One star because I've worn them for less than 2 months, and the sole is already separating from the shoe.
1	One of them has a short in the headset and now they won't charge
1	Poor build quality and not even half as bright as my stock halogen blinkers, and the one behind the exhaust melted on the first ride. Don’t bother buying these, oh and mine were wire backwards so red was connected to black and black to red to get them to work.
1	This did not come with installation instructions, but did include 3 different wipes and some positioning stickers. I thought I'd applied it well, but a week later, it just fell off my phone. Disappointed because it had such high reviews.
1	Waste of money, doesn't work at all!
1	May be great for the phone it is actually intended for. Does not fit my J7v properly as advertised, covers the camera giving you blurry pics.
1	I have had this couch for a little less than a year. The cushions have compressed to the point of being flat, regardless of how much you “fluff” them. There is very little down in these, it’s a foam pad wrapped in feathers which poke through the lining. I wish I had known that after a few months these would be hard an uncomfortable, I would have bought something else, as they were not cheap! Of course it was right after the point of being able to return them. If the idea of down appeals to you like it did to me, keep looking.
1	these are the worse plastic spoons I've ever bought/used. if you're only stirring coffee or eating cereal you'll be ok....anything else and they will break
1	Doesn’t hear good out of
1	Although it's a very beautiful set it is turning my finger green that's why a low review
1	Ridiculously small, can’t cover anything. Edited: Only received 2 tiny stickers.
1	Very loose for my baby, they easily fall off.
1	This hurt my head. There were a few excerpts that were decent, but I know 3rd graders with better spelling. Go to the library if you’re dying to read it, seriously it will take you 30 min to read and put it back on the shelf, where it belongs.
1	I didn’t receive sim card pin eject removal
1	I love the look of the clock, but... it can't keep an accurate time! It has a battery back-up as well as the power cord. I have reset the clock several times, as it seems to lose a minute or two a day. Very disapointed!
1	While I appreciated my shirt arriving on time I ordered a 2XL shirt and a large was shipped to me. The shirt clearly states LARGE but the sticker on the outside says XXL. Your quality control is not good and has messed up a birthday gift.
1	They are very soft, but shed terribly. would not order again.
1	i saw zero improvements
1	Broke after second use
1	It suppose I will get my package today, bought it 6 days ago with prime delivery and it has not being even sent
1	It broke down in a week
1	I just got this March 26th and it already broke. Changed batteries has soap and won’t do anything. Don’t buy this
1	This product was nothing like it was advertised online. It was different.
1	Very small and seems well like plastic material is too thin. Lock seems well made .. too small.
1	Does not even come close to the book . A Hollywood production
1	I have been using this exact brand and item but bought at Ulta. They are great. I got months of wear out of them. When they no longer carried it I ordered it from here. I got 2 pairs. They both did not stick to my skin at all. They couldn't be worn.....fell right off. I found them at CVS and did not have a problem with those. This was supposedly the same exact product. I'm not sure what to think but I would not recommend buying from here.
1	One of the cords quit working after 1 week
1	This is actually a delivery issue. If the delivery person is going to give the package to a resident, they get a photo of said residents. As proof it was given person. I never get my package or have any proof it was actually delivered.
1	The book has a sampling of stitches, but not that many. And the author admits to searching out old embroidered pieces and cutting them up and/or adding more stitches to it. I don't agree with that. To me those are heirloom pieces, not something to be butchered so you can say "see what I did".
1	Very poor quality. Don't waste your money.
1	This did not work at all. I cleaned and bathed my dog to get a fresh coat, applied the collar and she's still infested. We've treated the house too. This was a waste of money.
1	This is the second pair of studs I've gotten from this company and I really should have known better. They should include at least one extra earring back with every order. The backs themselves really are impossibly small and impossible to hold onto. Even the average sized fingers are too large to handle these backs. Within 5 minutes of opening the package and trying to put the earrings in, one of the backs is lost forever down my bathroom sink drain. Oh well......
1	Pulled off plastic arm and black ink went everywhere.
1	I never received this item.. this seller is a scammer
1	This was the worst purchase ever. After using it every few days to blend food and soups for my baby, it started emitting a plastic like smell and it stopped working. Do not buy in hopes that this wont happen to you (I did that) now I have to spend another $40+ on additional blender.
1	Very inaccurate description
1	Lasted two months...
1	I kind of feel like this is a rip off!! I’ve been seeing bugs everywhere and I brought six of these things!!
1	I thought led bulbs were supposed to last longer!? Passenger side bulb is out after being installed for 3 days. These are garbage do not buy them!
1	It's an ok wig if you're only going to use it once or twice, but if you're a cosplayer or plan on wearing this wig multiple times then you might want to keep looking. When I got the silver one the picture showed a middle part with no bangs but when I got it in the mail it had front bands and a tear in the head cap. You can see the cap when you move the hair around the material is thin and feels like it's going to fall out any moment. Moral of the story check the reviews before you buy a wig on Amazon
1	Once I received the product, the top part of the product began to break apart. Not happy at all with this product.
1	bought in April 18, 2018 and minute hand is broken!! less then 3 months pc. of j***
1	These are crap!! Glue peels off the pocket stretched out!!! Lost my cc many times:(
1	This did not work in my printer... according to the description, it should have.
1	Arrived with no adapter, no lighting element. It is junk folks. Ended up cutting holes so the light would shine through when used as a lamp shade a other lamp stand.
1	Doesn’t even work for a small bedroom. Extreme heat and humidity in a room will not be relieved with this machine. Get a real air conditioner.
1	What a load of BS. Turns out when the book gets good you're directed to go and join Amazon book club. Don't bother with this very disappointing
1	Broke the first day, didn't bother using the other one. Waste of money.
1	This product is very hard to get it to stay just where you need it. It also broke right at the clamp so I had to throw it away after 1 month of trying to use it.
1	Pretty disappointed when I unboxed it and the whole top part of the desk was covered in scratches. Looks like it was returned once already and sold as new. Will return...
1	Says delivered but never received , emailed company and nothing. :( Ps. Product may be 5 star (idk) but service or lack there of is less then 1 Star.
1	I'm curious as to how the seller can say velcro like, when the only part of this little "kit" that is velcro, is on the backing pad. When trying to clean, the abrasive discs go flying all over the place. Additionally, the hex arbor that screws into the backing pad, unscrews while using it.
1	Sorry to submit such a poor review, but this product is poorly made. The plunger is a total of 4" wide, very small, and the handle is very flimsy. The concept is good but construction poor.
1	Doesn't work at all. Seriously. Ordinary glue would have the same effect.
1	Amazon is great with their refund policy. I never could get this bell button to pair with my chime even though they are from the same company and the description assured me it would work with any Zenith chime set. Wrong. Thank goodness for Amazon and their amazing customer service. Many thanks. For now, anyone wanting entry will just have to use the 5 knuckle method and knock!
1	BEWARE - I have been ordering this Alessi kettle for 20+ years and this is most definitely a fake. The bird for the kettle melted over the course of a month. The weight of the kettle is lighter than previous kettles (purchased direct with Alessi) and the overall kettle feels cheap and flimsy. Purchase this kettle direct through Alessi and spend the extra money to get the real thing.
1	Bought the coffe maker April 26, worked great until today, August 3, quit working, blue start light just keeps flashing.
1	I will not use it again. Made my dogs feel bad. One of my dogs lost hair because of this product . I had to end up washing my dogs to remove as must as possible .
1	I only received 2 blades.
1	My order didn't come
1	My dearest friend lost her husband of only 9 years and I was very excited to be able to send her this gift. When she went to put it on the clasp broke. Very upsetting!!
1	I got a used product which did not come with the necessary pins for the wheels. Only needed it for one move and was very disappointed that I needed to move everything by hand because it did not come with these parts.
1	This product is not cotton, as stated on the product page, which was disappointing.
1	We've had these batteries for just over 30 days and one has already stopped working. You have 30 days to return these and now we are stuck with them. Don't buy them!
1	I received this book for free. I love dragon stories and was super excited to start reading. Having read that the writer had an amazing series that this tied into, I was hoping to have another favorite. Alas, this will not happen. The actual story had me intrigued. The use of so many words to say what a few would do, had me annoyed. I quit half way through. I lost interest. It took way to long to get anywhere. I loved the idea, but dragging out conversations and no notice of location changes made it hard to follow. I love learning new words, but it felt as if every page needed a thesaurus. Perhaps the other series written are not this way. Honestly, I just began to find it too much trouble to read. The story didn't flow, and it felt like it was just thrown together so the author could say another book was written. I do not recommend this book. Sorry.
1	Very poor quality doesn’t stick very well Not recommended at all
1	Just wrong fit, color, expectations... everything, I read the reviews and took a chance but was disappointed!
1	After 2 uses, this product stretched out and would no longer achieve suction on my daughter's arm. I would not purchase again.
1	Not a glass screen. Very disappointed.
1	These bottles leak if the are tipped over and when you gently shake them.
1	Failed the first day,it just don't work no matter how i try ,don't waste your money
1	Ordered about 8 back in March and 2 have already gone out and no longer work! Amazon wants me to pay to send them back for replacements...and when 2 more go out...then 2 more...?! Nope! Just save your money and don’t buy these!
1	Ridiculous, pun intended, seriously these rings are so thick and cumbersome that they are virtually useless. Im not small so i don't see anyone finding these useful. Keep shopping. There's better options.
1	After using for half of the product, it does not do much. I have not noticed any difference or reduction in wrinkles.
1	what do you expect for 20 bucks, knowing what i know now i would have opted for a more expensive pair, this was throwing 20 bucks into the wind
1	the brass sounded nice but the hose fell apart at the brass hookup to the spigot.
1	Bought this for my wifes IPhone 7. The ring on the back broke with in two days. Case is nice. But the ring is the weak link.
1	This tea used to be so awesome! I've ordered it on subscription for a long time now. Then they decided to change the recipe. It's not even close to the pictures above. Now it tastes like plastic!
1	The screen protector started to slide off the phone about 2 days in. Also, there were weird lines across the screen protector that affects regular phone usage. I tried to bring this issue up to the seller, but they didn't care. No response from them.
1	The charge lasted 20 seconds after a day of charging. I suspect I had a defective unit. Returned.
1	Absolutely garbage. It stopped working in less than one hour of use.
1	I literally didn’t even get to wear these for one day.... mid day one dropped and broke.
1	Buys their reviews. Garbage product.
1	3 of them broke after a few months... they just stop charging. Not worth buying if you have to replace them every 6 months.
1	You sent me region 2 not America. A waste of $35. No indication that American version was not available. Very bas business for one who buys on ma regular basis.
1	I tried many times to place them to no avail. They don't make the curve of my eyes. Just go straight and don't bend. I cut them, did what they said to make them fit but still no luck. Really wish they had worked....
1	This product is not what it claims to be. I didnt get all the parts and when I contacted them I never got a call back or even a written response. The power of the vacuum.....non existent . No suction and when u add the attachments theres no suction at all. Extremely disappointed and wish I didnt fall for the false advertising.
1	Never received my product but my money was taken
1	The bra itself was what I expected, but was stained a dingy yellow in several places and smelled so strongly that everything else in the package absorbed the odor. Very disappointing.
1	This unit was to be a direct fit, it was not and no wiring diagram so I could make it fit. The company was no help at all. I sent it back and got a EONON which I would recommend to everyone!! P.S. Amazon was great!! It wasn't there fault it was the company.
1	It was supposed to replace my existing battery for my IRobot but it didn't work.
1	My package never arrived.
1	No screws in package. Will be returning
1	Ordered last year and just got around to installing...... or atleast I thought I would. Unit is missing the * button
1	Good design but of poor product quality. The left rear wheel broke and dropped off from the space shuttle when the product arrived. It could not be re-attached to the shuttle as the part was really a defective one. And the paint finish on the shuttle shows signs of wear off. Upon closer inspection of the packing box, it looks like it may be a product return as the box was sealed with cheap glue tape with poor craftsmanship.
1	I loved the boot when received,but as soon as I wore them in rainy weather the boot fell apart. It seems like the rubber sole is coming a loose and the foot insert is non existing it totally shocked me for a boot that's maybe 3 months old. Don't wear them outside.
1	Junk! Broke within 2 days of having it. The piece that plugs into your phone broke off in my phone. Would work for a few minutes then I would get a message on my phone saying this iPhone doesn’t support this accessory.
1	Did not get the bonus sticker as advertised
1	Returned. Because it did not fit Please confirm refund.
1	Put this screen on the cell phone and within two days,(DID NOT DROP IT), it was cracked, about halfway to the bottom. Very disappointed. Would not recommend.
1	Cheap locks/latches pieces broken upon arrival, super soft wood and smaller than expected.... Instructions not very helpful had to guess on hinges on nest section. Would have returned it but the 2hrs worth of work to assemble it I have to try and use it, not sure it will hold 4 hens, maybe better for 2 hens or a rabbit
1	A very helpful note would be that THIS BULB WILL NOT WORK IN RESIDENTIAL HOMES!!!
1	The handle ripped off after just a month of use.
1	This cookbook isn't simple, as claimed. I bought it for the photos and supposed ease of recipes, but the truth is most of the stuff in there is flavorless and more difficult than necessary. The most frustrating part, aside from it not being recipes most people really eat, is that the 'simple' recipes require having other recipes made before-hand, and then lists them as an ingredient. I sent it back.
1	I tried both in the pack and neither of them would even stick to my screen even after cleaning it with the provided kit
1	Never received, but paid for...
1	My product never arrived. Amazon status says package is lost and they did not bother sending another or returning my 45 dollars!! Not happy with having to hunt this item down and find out why it never got here!
1	Mine came broken in several places. Cheaply made and probably wouldn’t last long if it ever did get loaded with a sub. Considering a bonfire tonight, I’ll post a video of it going up in flames later.
1	Works well. Needles seem to be a bit too thick. Worried that using this may damage my basketball. Have used it twice and it has worked well so far, however. UPDATE: I used this pump for a third time on my Wilson Evolution Basketball and it pushed in the rubber circle into the ball, popping it. Need is TOO thick. Buyer beware
1	I bought and paid for this item but never received it. No explanation was given nor when I should expect it delivered.
1	Really did not like the scent of this dry shampoo at all. It made my hair feel dry and cakey.
1	Pros: - Inexpensive. Cons: - Would not work with the newer version 5 firmware for the Switch. I didn't realize that every time Nintendo released a version of firmware that this controller would also have to be upgrade (if it even has one) in order to work with it. - The controller doesn't have the gyro/motion function that the Pro Controllers do. This is more important than I thought. I would suggest waiting for the Pro Controllers to go on sale and buy them.
1	DISCS ARE SCRATCHED!!! At least 25% of them have issues! We opened the factory seal on theses but they were horrible!!! We love this show but the product we received was absolutely terrible! It was a gift and I wasn't told about the issues until after the short return period had ended otherwise I would have returned these!!!
1	Great concept but didn't work. Tried all of the recommended bottles & none of them fit. Returned it.
1	DOES NOT FIT LG STYLO!!!!!! Way to big, cannot trim it to fit.
1	This case is not compatible with the official OnePlus screenguard, it causes several air bubbles through day to day use.
1	I purchased this battery for my 2001 Audi tt. Despite the application being listed, this group size will not fit. The battery box would have to be completely cut out and modifications done. My intention was to return the item, but returns are not accepted! So, I have a $200 battery that fits nothing and I have no use for. Good job.
1	This product was of the lowest quality and would not apply. The eye shadows would not even make it onto the brush or apply to the eyelid, and the eyeliner would also not apply.
1	This was part of a present for a loved one and the top coat gel was totally broken, it was dry and all over the box (which was HUGE BTW) REALLY DISAPPOINTED. I won't buy from this seller again.
1	We bought this for our daughter for Christmas and it didn't work out of the box. It was smaller than expected, felt very cheap and did not work when the buttons were pushed. We were returned it.
1	Not what I was looking for. Need planner for work and this particular planner was overwhelming and too busy for me.
1	had modify to fit my f250
1	Great product for the first 3 weeks - then .... the strap breaks. Gutted.
1	Received went to blow up for granddaughters party it had a small hole on the top of the balloon couldn’t use for the party bought it for nothing disappointing
1	When I first starting watching this, I thought that it was satire; sadly, it's not. Houdini needs to come back from the dead to debunk this show and others like it. Humanity has no hope.
1	Absolutely horrible, the whole container barely kept a 16 ounce bottle of water cool. Threw them in the trash, garbage. Buyer beware.
1	I ordered 2 pairs of earrings and only received one pair. I received the moon stone but am missing the amethyst. :(
1	Never received this item and i paid for it a month and a half ago i wouldn't even rate this seller a 1 and as far as the item i dont know
1	Not the right size. Way too small. I may be big but by buying the XXL I should have had a lot of extra room, it didn't even fit.
1	The bottle leaked and arrived only half full. The box it was packed in is covered in oil.
1	Terrible. I got a used pair in the mail. So much for new. Someone’s greasy eyebrows were still on them.
1	It broke after only having it for 3 weeks.
1	...unless you want little wads of yarn roving floating in your fish tank or terrarium. I received a little cup of small, damp, grayish-green balls, but being new to marimos I didn't really know what to look for. Over the course of a week or so in the tank they slowly became more pale and gray as if the color was fading out of it like a dye, and I did a bit of research and realized I'd been swindled. I dissected one and I'm fairly certain it wasn't even any sort of living plant matter, it seriously just looked like a balled up piece of synthetic fibers. They went in the trash and I found some actual lush, green marimos.
1	It stopped charging and then over heated for the entire day and still wouldn’t charge
1	So I bought these filters as a cheaper option to k&n or something similar, I thought the red color was just the color of the cloth used to make these, but it is actually paint, I've used brake cleaner, k&n air filter cleaner, and also left them to soak in paint thinner for 4 hours and this paint will not come off of these filters. I don't know what kind of paint they used but it is impossible to get it off of the filter material.. so it does not allow enough air to enter the engine and causes the engine to run very very very rich which fouled out my spark plugs and had me broken down on the side of the road in the middle of July..
1	This was the 2nd one I had to order because TSA made me throw the 1st one out. Unfortunately, this one didn't even last 2 months before it fell apart. I don't know what happened to it but something inside broke; the slide switch no longer works. I definitely won't be purchasing this one (or any other like it) again.
1	This Fitbit wristband broke within a few weeks and was not repairable. Had to contact Fitbit customer service for assistance. Not worth the money.
1	bought 6 for the whole family. 2 came with battery issue. plug in to a charger and the screen shows a battery charging. but after an couple of minutes or an hour, even left it all night, it didn't charge the battery. unplugged it and it turns off... the other seems to be working fine..
1	Not that great. Purchased to run the cable for my dash cam. It does not hold the cable, and they simply detach and falls off.
1	I purchased twice and both times it had leaks I emailed about the “warranty” and they made me send a video of the leak and claimed they sent another one out to me, however, when I asked about shipping info I never received any. Very cheap material save yourself from the trouble.
1	My Wheaton Terrier had it destroyed in 10 minutes. Blue pieces everywhere 👎🏻
1	It’s simple- do not buy this product- only one worked out of the box- no kidding.
1	Difficult to hook up and plays in black and white. I returned it and ordered a different brand.
1	Had a change of address with the vendor to continue my subscription and nothing happy. The last one I got was November 2018.
1	This replacement glass is not what we ordered. It wasn't glass at all, but it was plexiglass and with a blue tint to the plexiglass as well. Was not clear glass as the item description suggests. Would not order again.
1	Its cheaply made it tore within the 1st mouth.
1	I did not order these nor receive them.
1	they do not cut worth a darn
1	Didn't receive item?
1	This came with all the materials to apply the screen and it was easy to apply. However, it lasted only a couple days, then a giant crack. I replaced it with the second one. The same thing a few days later. The phone had NOT been dropped. My screen has been fine for the year and a half that I've had it, minus one scratch. I don't understand why these protectors won't last.
1	I get that the price is cheap compared to retail from mercedes and by that one should assume these are knockoffs. But using a picture of authentic Mercedes center caps, including a picture of the Mercedes label's, in the description is just straight up trying to mislead people. Take the photo off the ad so it isn't misleading. That aside, the quality of these is very poor compared to the real Mercedes made ones. You get what you pay for I guess. The real ones are around $25 each but made considerably better and look better. If you want a cheap solution and don't care about quality at all these are the center caps for you.
1	Cheap material, three items broke in first two hours of having. Realize it's cheaper than other sets, but not worth it!
1	I purchased this jacket as a replacement for my fleece jackets i am currently using. The temperature I was working in was 25 degrees, as I am not a polar bear it did not keep me warm. The zippers are very small and cheap, the slightest pressure on the lower end of the zipper while it is zipped up and it will separate. It is very difficult to use the zipper with gloves and the sewing of the jacket is porous enough to allow the down work it's way out of the compartments. You look like a molting duck! I would have returned the jacket but I snagged it on a bush and it now has a small hole so I'm stuck with it. This is not the quality of jackets I am accustom to from Eddie Bauer. If all you are going to use this jacket for is to get to the car to the club or store then back to car, it will work. But then why don't you purchase a good quality fleece?
1	2 flushes then it is gone. Horrible product
1	My fault, I failed to read the negative reviews!!! I was in a hurry and this seemed like a good item. What good is it if there is no power option provided!!!!! I have a universal charging unit with multiple sizes and none fit. Again this is a timely thing and I would have spent more money for a unit that included a power source!!!!!!!!
1	Unfortunately, after following the instructions to a T I have experienced much lower hatch rates than other brands on Amazon. This brand claims to be 90% hatch rate. I’d be lucky to get 50%. They claim to have a money back guarantee. I will be testing that out. The price was right, hatch rate not so much.
1	This hose literally broke is 30 seconds.
1	I have small home put in several places. still have mice and all that comes with that.
1	They suck not even worth returning so some other sucker buys them. Way too small had no traction
1	This product didn’t last 5 months........Never buy Used,just go to a truck stop and buy it New 😡.
1	It doesn’t actually absorb liquids, it is permeable and they still stain the floor. Now this matt is ugly and deformed and merely covers the oil stains it has allowed to hit the floor.
1	The hooks were separated from the body of three of the hangers during shipping and I was unable to reattach them. They went right into the garbage. I would not recommend this product at all.
1	A shame I can’t give zero stars!! I followed the instructions and before the 2 minuets were up the product began heating up as noted. I began to apply per instructions and before I could cover the patch the mixture was already hard!! Less than three minutes!!! $10.00 gone for nothing but a mess!!
1	This chair is roughly a year old and it's breaking down already. Armrests are cheap and wobble like none other. Chair itself if stiff and doesn't provide much support. The warranty is essentially useless and doesn't cover much of anything you'd expect for paying the price. Additionally, customer service doesn't respond to calls or emails. Do yourself a favor and go Secret Lab. In the meantime, this is $350 (at time of purchase) that I can't even say was well spent after 1 year of use. The most frustrating part is that nobody seems willing to help despite reaching out to Amazon and Noble Chairs.
1	Bought this product because it had many great reviews, but it has not been that great for me it has made my break outs worse and has not cleared up my skin in any way. I don't recommend this product due to the price it is not worth it.
1	Terrible quality, didn't fit as promised. Horrible customer service
1	Save your money. These bags don't eliminate any odor that I can tell. What a waste.
1	Costume quality. The top of the wig you can see right through and see the wefts.
1	The sound quality of these wireless earbuds is excellent- the reason for my purchase. Unfortunately, they stopped working after 6 months of light use (occasional in home use- 1-2 hours per week, kept in case). Obviously disappointed. Cannot recommend.
1	Mine had the most unpleasant smell to it when it was wet. I used it once and had to throw it out. Very disappointed!
1	Material is flimsy, I wasn't even pulling on it.
1	The design and band would be great but it does not clip into my blaze frame. Too big. Useless
1	We have not received the package. Please return our money
1	10 days, total of 16 days clean. Still positive.
1	I have to side eye all the positive reviews because this is not a good product. It would not allow me to transfer more than 4 videos/pictures. Never again!
1	I thought that not having to pay 25 dollars for my Boosted Plus' belts would be a steal, and so I was influenced to purchase these belts which are much cheaper. However, upon opening the package, I noticed that both of the belts were ripped. This unfortunate experience has turned me off to this product that I have only purchased once. I will not be purchasing again though. I would just recommend purchasing the belts from Boosted as they are good quality for what I have always received.
1	These are SUPER SMALL. Wish I didn't purchase them.
1	Molded and not in good condition. I cannot plant these. Not labeled. Do not buy!
1	Biggest rip off. It just pushes the hair around and the cover pops off after a few pushes. Very disappointed
1	Received this item a few minutes ago and was glad to see it arrive. Put it in the printer and immediately received an error message that the cartridges we're both low. The photo shows the computer readout indicating the color is just below half full and the black is almost gone. These are brand new and haven't been used yet, because the printer has a feature and won't print with cartridges that low. Very disppointed! As I continue to contact Valuetoner, I will update my review if handled.
1	The product didnt work. The plumber installed it and water was flowing out of the heater and flooding my bathroom. Couldn't get another one because by the time I installed it the refund period for it which was 1 month was up.
1	I never got my bands. No body responded to My email either!😡
1	! I was hoping that this product would do as good a job on my expensive cast iron enamel kitchen sink. It did not do the clean nor polish. Very disappointed with this product.That's what I get for trying to save money. Back to buying Delta Cast Iron Sink cleaner at $15 a bottle and using it sparingly.
1	If you don’t require the earrings to match, then this is perfect for you. I received two different earrings, they are completely unusable.
1	Do not buy these! Leaves a blue stain on the inside of the bowl at the top of the water and has a strong smell. Wish I didn't buy these in bulk. I'll give them away free if I could.
1	Product was broken when it arrived and is unusable. Very disappointed
1	The camera hole is in the wrong spot
1	Cute dress but washed it once in cold water and it shrunk and was not wearable for me, had to return
1	Very poor quality . Bad stiching , the pockets started coming apart after 3 days .
1	It was sent in a large box with a little bubble wrap around it totally shattered ..not a smart way to send in the mail you think?? Disappointed
1	These will not hold a charge. Save your money for something better.
1	Sound quality is alright--for about 5 minutes; the headphones volume cuts in half within a few minutes of using, to the point your music is nearly inaudible in a room with ANY noise in it. This is from a FULL battery, mind you. I looked through reviews and didn't see this point, so I'm thinking I may have gotten a defective unit that can't deliver proper voltage from the battery during usage. In any case, I'm very disappointed with my purchase.
1	Each sponge came off the base within a few days. One came off on its first use. Very poor quality. I would not recommend.
1	Did not get any results from the products.
1	Been buying this a while now but the last 2 orders the quality has been terrible. It has greenish patches and my cat won’t touch it. Waste of money as this product is expensive to just toss out. A couple of the pouches looked normal, but my cat wouldn’t touch it-and he loves this food.
1	The pants have a belt loop sewed on backwards, so the all-black pants have a white stripe on them. I ordered a replacement, and it had the exact same defect. This seller is a scam for selling defective merchandise.
1	No dust removing tape, no alignment tape or anything help with alignment. Exact the same size as screen area, so not ANY margin for misalignment. Cannot move at all once let down on the screen, so almost no chance to do it right. Not a recommendation at all.
1	I was so excited to get this but when it came it was not the box set. They sent me the 4 seasons in 4 different cases like I ordered each one separate. I ended up sending if back for a refund. I'm now looking for another seller for this item.
1	Never again! Yeti leaves a bad taste in your mouth! America First! Shame on you Yeti!
1	The black case attracts to must visible dust and does not look clean at all. The screen protector did not stick onto the edges so had to take if off and throw it away. Not all all satisfied with the purchase! :(
1	I haven't seen this anywhere else to buy so will have to return and re-buy. Frustrated that I don't have the option to exchange and the price on this fluctuates but a lot daily! The first one came with a dent on the top, so it wasn't round and looked bad. The second one was all scratched around the knob, looked awful and you couldn't even see the scratches until it was taken out of the package. Way overpriced for what this is and since so far all damaged metal. Hoping the next one will come in decent enough condition
1	I read all the reviews re: size of these slippers before making this purchase for my son who is a big Boo fan. But the sizing is still off. It was smaller than expected and because the head of the Boo is big, you have to be careful not to trip!
1	All lights had been intentionally sabotaged. Packaging was intact from Amazon but when I opened shipping box the individual light boxes had been opened and the pull chain switch had been yanked out.
1	Received Cat Litter that I did not order!!! I have had so many problems with delivery and orders with Amazon.
1	I would not buy these again, They ripped open day one.
1	Love the style and the finish but there is cracks in the paint and damage to the corner. Would like a new set. Other than the inconvenience they appear to be adorable and minimalistic modern attractive. Perfect for a studio!
1	Looks cheap and ugly.
1	WE did not receive this order.
1	Said it would fit my truck and it didn't...and it was too late to return.
1	The Kenley Car Gel Seat Cushion was a big disappointment, it was so comfortable, but today the gel part leaked. I bought it for my son, who weighs 160 pounds and was very careful with the cushion. The gel leakage caused us to put it in the trash.
1	I bought this item and it came damaged , oil spilled out. I have video of it. I emailed the company and I have not heard anything back. I will use another company with better customer service from now on!
1	Not compatible with same brand door bracket, although listing advertises them as compatible parts and Amazon lists them as frequently bought together.
1	This power hub is not inexpensive. But the quality is non-existent. Out of 10 port, less than half works. Some ports worked yesterday (the day it arrived) does not work today. Very unreliable. I didn't even get for enough to test performance. LED light does not light up, and PC does not recognize those bad ports. Total JUNK. I suggest potential buyer avoid this.
1	This product does not create spiral noodles at all. It creates curls of the vegetable. The directions provided are insufficient and minimal. Worst amazon purchase ever!!
1	Never did recieve them. Amazon said I recieved and signed for them, but that was incorrect. They did reimburse me, but what good is that when I need the magnets. I'm sure they are great, they look like they would do the job.
1	The face is very distorted and barely looks like a face.
1	I really like it but too small
1	This material was definitely not worth the price. Came in very wrinkly... and you can't iron thw wrinkles out. You almost need to add a real suit jacket so it looks semi okay
1	I pumped it over 200 times and nothing cane out I opened the product and saw the was no tube inside, so this is why i was unable to pump it! This product came without box, so its either a fake product or was used before sent to me
1	Arrived quickly, so I can say that. Did not work and had to return -- very cheap feeling and looking device -- buyer beware.
1	This product did not work with my iPhone 7. It said it was not compatible. So I wasted my money and can’t get a refund
1	The heat from the interior of the car melted the glue and the cover has all but come loose...
1	the volume control broke after 1 week of use and they won't allow me to return it. Bad quality product!
1	Extremely small! This is my fault for not reading the specs... but pic was deceiving on size for sure. This item is not sturdy and collapses unless packed full... Waste of trunk space.
1	My daughter always has worn a size 10. For the first time, they were too small. Unfortunately, I have now waited too long to return, but we have never had a problem from other Amazon sellers for a size 10 sandal. These will have to be discarded and we will just have to find a more accurate Amazon seller with the correct size.
1	The sealing surface is too small, it leaks all over the place. Very poor design a waste of money and time.
1	Broke into a million pieces and cheap
1	Tasteless. Tossed them
1	These are JUNK. The design of the handle is so bad that you cannot make a proper cut. So I would say they don't function as scissors.
1	Comes with fuses that were too powerful for our dryer, ended up blowing out both circuit boards on dryer which would have costed $375 plus labor to fix. Thankfully we ended up finding exact same dryer super cheap on Craigslist and used the circuit boards off that.
1	WE bought 2 The first stayed red and made a buzzing noise. Second one worked for a week and then we could not get it to work. was in process of returning them but the ended up in the trash by error but go figure
1	I wanted to work my way through most of these assorted coffees before I posted my experience ... and I would bet that 60 to 70 percent of my cups have had bad, old, expired coffee! I have simply been pouring out most of the cups because of the awful taste. I will not order this again.
1	I received these all broken. Very disappointing as I needed them for a cake decoration and I now don’t have the time to reorder.
1	I ordered this knife and Amazon was not able to find my front door and drop it off to me even though I live in a large suburban area.
1	Gun ad in the back pages of the book. I DON'T APPROVE! What the heck? Amazon is not allowing me to include the photo... :-( Requested and received a full refund.
1	Very disappointed with these balloons. One of the big rings came with a hole in it and another two balloons popped as I was filling them with helium.
1	This product does not work too large for my kureig
1	While the duvet insert would have been absolutely perfect, size, fluffiness, and soft. It came with two huge yellow and black spots on it. Since it comes vacuum sealed there's not good way to return so I'm bleaching it in hopes it'll come out. Just disappointed that it looks like I got a returned one.
1	Did not like this item.
1	This product stopped working after about 2 months, which is of course out of the return policy. When we plug it in, it doesn’t heat up and there is a red flashing light on the controller. We had a similar blanket that lasted for several years before being destroyed in an unfortunate accident. We thought this would be a good replacement, but it did not turn out to be.
1	I ordered this product not even a month ago and the gold has worn off.
1	When I opened the container the paint was completely hard and solid, unusable. I am very disappointed it was not worth the money.
1	So thin you couldn’t wear it I would love to return ASAP!!
1	This is the second time I ordered it. The first time it broke just like this and was able to have them replace it. Now it happened again and the window to return it closed. So now I have to find another because I love having this in my car. I do nothing but fill it and have it plugged in and yet again it stopped working and when I took it out everything had broken. Truly disappointing. If I could it wouldn’t get any stars
1	The product description was misleading. The rolls are normal or slightly small than normal sized rolls.
1	I paid for this product and never received it so i cannot say if I liked it or not. Sorry still waiting.
1	Defective product in a worn box.
1	One star for cuteness and color variety. The rest needs reworking. The touch sensitivity is annoying as it changes colors & modes every time you touch it, which leads to the biggest issue with this nightlight. You HAVE TO PICK IT UP to reach the hard to get to, tiny power button in the rear next to the charging port. For some inexplicable reason, the remote does NOT turn the unit on unless you first press the power button (again, tiny and hard to access in the rear). Poorly designed. So basically to turn it on, you pick it up, press the power button, and since you’re still touching it as you put it down, it cycles through modes. Did I mention it deflates/collapses easily, so you have to reshape it first before putting it down. By the time you set it down it usually ends up on the fast color cycle which is super annoying. Just make the remote able to turn it on so you don’t have to manhandle it every time. Also, the charging port itself isn’t a great fit for the charging cord. Really feels like you’re brute forcing it in. And a full charge is surprisingly short so it’s pretty much plugged in most of the time. This product obviously didn’t go through any honest testing. Definitely disappointing and would not recommend.
1	The arrow was broken/head-band was cut/wings had a large spill stain . The bag had been cut open. Will not purchase again .
1	This did not work with my iPhone. iPhone requires that you have a special connector if you are trying to connect to a non-apple TV. It is advertised as if you don’t need that piece.
1	This extended warranty goes with a computer that was never received.
1	If I could give zero stars I would. Came in broken now I have to pay to ship it back to get a refund don’t waste your money!!!!!
1	Never got to use it. Did not fit my Expert. Money down the drain.
1	For the second time I received an Amazon envelope unsealed and empty. I would like a replacement sent to me. I can send a photo of the empty envelope if that would help.
1	Dislike.... battery life is only 45 minutes.
1	I ordered oil rubbed bronze, and this us what I got.
1	Come to my attention that amazon has shipped a few broken speakers of this make. Checking reviews I’m not alone. I supplied the hardware they did not. Hopefully I’ll get my money back as speedily as they got there’s.
1	DO NOT BUY!!!!! These earbuds are poorly made low quality knock offs that broke (both pair) in the first day of use.
1	I ordered the hose but seller said they could not help me and refunded my money back..I would still love to order oe if its possible?
1	I enjoyed the first books in this series, but the writing drones on and on. Where is the editor to curb George's ramblings? The character don't really grow.
1	This is without a doubt the worst phone I have ever owned. Scrolling drags, sound is terrible, battery life sucks. Anyone that give this phone five stars must work for the company.
1	They sent the wrong size that I ordered
1	At first it started to work, then the animals like cats and dog just walked in my garage area and popped all over the place. What is supose to do, it doesn't. Black Ball
1	Extremely dirty & had to return and had no cords, memory cards or controllers
1	The product I received is definitely a fake. The packaging and brush looks different. I’ve used the product for a long time and it does not look or feel the same at all. This is a scam.
1	beautiful color and arrived very quickly... but I can't get the lid off...
1	Piece of junk thought in the trash after two uses
1	Extremely cheap- worth $1-2 max. I will not pitch from this seller again.
1	This product sucks! Not only the package arrived damaged and all the bolts/nuts were all over the place, the instructions are very bad. It took me over 4 hours to put it together.
1	I never received them!
1	Great price horrible wig, was not the wig pictured. Purchased two and both are completely different. Tangled as soon as it was applied. Very unsatisfied, false advertising.
1	This was so tiny it's less than 4 inches long. Don't be revived by the supposed 1 oz mold this is a micro mold it's tiny as Heck
1	It's a very cute case but Its not very sturdy inside. One side of the case doesn't stay snapped in and there is a little space for my phone to move around in it. Not compatible with screen protectors either. Feels like cheap plastic. I dont recommend this case
1	Thin and little to no protection of the phone. The case broke next to the power button after about a month of light useage.
1	Junk - save your money and sanity - don't buy this thing! Computer (Windows 10) would not recognize dongle. Could not get this thing to work. What a piece of junk and waste of money!
1	These did not work in my printer no matter how many times I tried to clear off the ink on the connectors and they wouldn't allow me to return them claiming the day I contacted them my warranty has expired the night before.
1	This product cant be specific to the Note 9. It hasnt fit correctly since initial application. My note 8 protector fit like a glove, this one is horrible
1	Fit was correct for a replacement on my 2004 polaris magnum 330 ATV. Petcock seemed to be decently made, however the valve leaked right out of the box. Will have to go elsewhere, probably pay 3X as much for an OEM replacement. You get what you pay for.
1	I ordered this ring after years of waiting to own a citrine that I would love. Shipping was way out and so they Ended up refunding my $$. I wasn’t going to leave a review seeing as I got the ring for free at that point. However, a stone fell out the first time I put it on. So, even though it’s free, now it’s junk. Don’t waste your $$.
1	Don’t fit well and cannot return them
1	These chargers are garbage. Don’t waste your money. I bought them about 2 months ago and every single charger in the pack has stopped working.
1	Very cute but no animal is going to keep these on their head.
1	Very cheap material sowing very poorly patter did not match most sets include 2 sets of towels for 2 people thus were thin and one set not happy ok
1	These lights leach water into the tubes, thus creating a hazard. Living in Florida we get rain, guess i will have to seal the units once they dry out. Not happy
1	These batteries are horrible. They do not hold a charge for more than a day. I am ready to buy a different brand.
1	Ordered 2 ornaments. One was painted ok but one clearly had mistakes. Hand painted makes it sound unique however, the clearly obvious mistakes makes them look like a child's work. Overpriced for the poor quality.
1	When I opened it up it seemed like I was using 2 month old mascara. I do not recommend!
1	Material feels like sandpaper
1	Worst than sleepin with a cast on
1	Zero stars if I could. States 420 coins. Only got 320. Need to find an additional 100 by Wednesday.
1	No spacing between the words. Poor workmanship!
1	Would not order that brand again
1	I purchased two and they were both open. I had to return it :(
1	This is not the color advertised.
1	Item sent was 10 food storage containers
1	Was not as described
1	Total waste of money. Doesn’t look anything like that.
1	Wouldn't play. Stopped 3 x and then wouldn't restart at all. I won't be doing this again anytime soon!
1	Not what is pictured. Sent back!
1	My 4 month old bearded dragon did not like any of the different packages of food. The thing that holds the cups is decent. The cups are tiny and not really reusable. I wish the holder just came with a cup so I can use my own food
1	The hose connects to the top and doesn’t have a good seal for all the air leaks out when pumping. Was a bit useless and disappointing.
1	I only got 4 brushes.
1	I did not receive it them, I was call amazon and they left my package in an other address. They put my money back in my account
1	If you constantly wear them, the plating will tarnish and the base metal will appear, you won't see it right away because it'll be the skin of your ear eating away at the plating. So please don't buy unless you plan on wasting some money. Also it is cheap and that should tell you what will happen.
1	The shape was what I was looking for but the bristles are way to soft to get through my hair. I even have very fine hair.
1	Received item. Both keys broken
1	Bought in January and now the numbers are not showing.
1	This product didn’t work and the battery hookup seemed defective. It seemed cheaply made
1	I bought 20 patches and I never felt or saw any changes.
1	Didn’t have an issue with this product. It just wasn’t what I needed for an art project. I processed a return and I still have not had my money refunded back into my account.
1	They don’t raise the lift gate to the very top of its travel.
1	The product was not delivery and the provider is not answering.
1	This arrived and was a normal razor in razor comm packaging taped back together. Didn’t even have batteries...
1	Worked well for about 3weeks the starting being really flaky. Threw it away.
1	You can purchase 4 of these bulbs roughly the price of 2 more expensive brand name bulbs. Ultimately you'll end up with ZERO, because they are not reliable or work well. I have 2, One failed to connect at all the other had minimal success. Some technology requires an investment, purchase the industry leading brand and enjoy. Skip these unless you want expensive regular light bulbs
1	Hi i am still waiting to receive my order. please advise regarding Thanks and regards, Gal
1	Unit was defective . One motor did not work and no camera feed . Sent back. Will re order hopefully have better luck with the next one. Update Will not reorder . They have had my return since wednesday it is now sunday and seller has not processed my return .
1	Don't Buy!! The materials used are very cheep.
1	WENT to the beach at night once. The collar worked there but not back.
1	Disappointing. Only had then about 2 weeks and the 3 foot cable has already failed.
1	Card is showing "corrupted" error when first putting into phone. I will return and try another from same company hopefully with better quality.
1	Not ingraved waste of money
1	One transmitter quit working after less than a month. Still trying to figure out how to change the battery. Item won’t work in a power outage. Easy to install.
1	Did not work! Still have a dog that is suffering!
1	I like the color and material but that’s about it. THIS WILL DO NOTHING TO PROTECT YOUR SCREEN OR CAMERA. My screen stuck out from the case, and my camera almost sticks outside the provided lip. It’d be worth spending a little bit more to protect your $1000 phone.
1	I originally purchased this because quite a few reviews said you just plug and play. I did everything I could to make it work for me and nothing happened. Returned it and requested a new one. The second one doesn't work either. Don't know if there's a bad batch of these or what but this product isn't for me.
1	Went to use it the second time and the hose adapter won’t expand. If you don’t have to use the adapter it works well. I can’t use it now
1	I loved the look of them but they didn't fit my 3/4 axle:(
1	Poor quality!! Using for my little ones pee pee moments during diaper changes. When I cut in half fluff dust us everywhere!!!!! Super duper duper thin
1	the colors are very dull and not at all like in advertising
1	Worked good for first 2 weeks. Now none of the outlets OR USB will work. Terrible
1	I purchased these for my daughter for Christmas. We were out of town for the holidays - warm weather - so she didn't get to wear them right away. She loved the boots and worn them a few times. Within the first month of wear - worn only a few times - the seam on the right boot came completely out. Now she is afraid to wear them since she is worried the entire boot is going to split at the seam. She has worn them so few times, there isn't even wear on the bottom. Horrible quality for the high price.
1	Does not work as intended. Missing slot for braces to keep the bag open.
1	Doesn't work at all. I live in Hawaii. We have plenty of mosquitos. I've used the indicated attractant, 3 tanks of propane, moved it to areas outlined, did everything but sit on it and let the mosquitos use me as bait. It just doesn't do anything. I have about a teaspoon of dead bugs in the hopper. Don't waste your money.
1	Bought this in February and two weeks after we got it had to get a replacement as blades broke. Well got the replacement and today the blade broke again.
1	Hello, this item was not very good. I tried in every socket in my house and the last chargers I ordered are not usable. I really liked the pink i once ordered. Just wanted you to know.
1	Product is not very well built and did not last more then 2 months before completely falling apart. I had to throw it away. Also doesn't work if you have any kind of case on your devices. Doesn't hold and iPad Pro 9.7 without falling over onto itself. I don't recommend this product. Wish I could have returned it for a refund.
1	Too cumbersome. It needs a wire or blade to make initial cut into snow
1	It’s actually really pretty. But they sent me one. So that was awful. I ordered for my wedding and had to have a friend make some last minute instead.
1	I ordered 10 of these. They never arrived. For the first time ever I received a message from Amazon saying "your package is lost". I just re-ordered. If they arrive I'll change my review...hopefully!!
1	I love the product; however, ordering online is a mistake. One of the caps came off and there was a soap mess in the box.
1	Did not work for my f150
1	Trying to get ahold of company for a week no response poor customer service and they charge you to return despite prime shipping
1	The cable that I received does not work.
1	the piece of plastic that connects the lid to the bottle BROKE IN LESS THAN A MONTH! I didn't even use it as roughly as I have my previous Nalgene bottles :(
1	I've had this mirror for less than 1 month & the charging port is already not working. I put.good Energizer batteries in it & the light& it is very dim I am very disappointed with this cheap product !
1	I began getting significant foot and calf cramps (in the night and especially in the early morning) after taking this as directed. I stopped and for a month had no cramps. The cramps resumed upon taking this again.
1	Do not buy this grinder!!! It started jamming up within 3 months of purchasing. I have to stick a butter knife in the grinder and manually mash the coffee that gets stuck at the bottom of the grinder to try to get it to work...then it jams again. Stay clear of this grinder. Spend your money wisely on another grinder.
1	Do not order from Tora foods. This is the best tea, but I never received it. Need this for daily living. Not happy.
1	Broke first time I used it!
1	didn't arrive in 2 days as advertised
1	This is a toy at best. There is no sound variation, it all sounds the same.
1	Not as picture shows. Such a disappointment I was expecting Easter toys . Was wrong
1	THEY TOOK MY MONEY 2 MONTHS AGO AND NEVER SHIPPED THE PRODUCT TO ME. THIS PLACE IS A SCAM. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM EVER.
1	This product is not the correct product for my vehicle! I specifically ordered it based on the information provided for my vehicle a 2006 325 XI all wheel drive. Now I cannot return it due to the expiration deadline was December 13 2017. I will never purchase another item from this seller.
1	this ripped right under the plug and is very difficult 2 use now. Can you send me a new one?
1	This did not come as a ball.. it came already fluffed as if someone had already played with it. Probably is a knock off as others are suggesting. Awful packaging, the box was all torn apart. Also took forever to get here. did not receive it by Christmas as the seller indicated. Please don't waste your money on this scam
1	I bought this Feb. 2018. It is April 2018. I used it a total of 4 times before it basically went to hell as far as the suctioning and the clip broke which allows you to open it. Now I can't even get my money back or a replacement. Two words ...STAY AWAY!!!
1	I ordered this product 2 times and received the wrong item each time. The package says it’s dice but they are actually 7/8” poker chips.
1	Boo this seat only lasted 5 days before the seal broke from me sitting in it in my car... I weight 135 pounds. Do not buy
1	We have central A/C. This product developed mildew in less than a year, and it won't wash out. A complete waste of money.
1	Been waiting months to recieve this order... still waiting! I have tried to reach out to them but they do not respond.
1	Not worth the money. Earphone has statistics come out when listen
1	Arrived in terrible condition. There is a wrinkle in the material and it has deep dents on the front. When you open it, glue is visible at the seams. Even if the front wasn't dented, it still looks cheap. I was too busy with school to return it during the return window, but needless to say, I will never be using this.
1	I ordered Maple Pecan k cups for my last two orders and was sent sugar cookie.
1	Bag arrived ripped open with candy strewn about the box and some of the candies were partially unwrapped - I’m throwing the whole thing away
1	While this product marked as delivered, I never received it. I receive an error message every time I try and leave the seller feedback. There is also no way for me to dispute the transaction or contact customer service.
1	I would give it 0 stars if I could. The box was disheveled and the label was half off. There was no seal on the box nor was the tube sealed in any way. The product looked used. I contacted the seller and was asked if I wanted a replacement or a refund. I responded that if a factory sealed product was the replacement, I would be happy with that. I have yet to hear back. I believe I have wasted my money. In this instance, Amazon’s lower price option was the WRONG option.
1	I know these are cheap gloves, but extremely poor quality, even at this price. Odd fit with thumb too long, fingers tight (sized according to chart) Stitching looks like it won't last and seams are all over the place. Would have returned them but needed to use them for a ride as soon as they arrived. On a brighter note the touchscreen feature works well
1	Mine leaked after using it for a week. I thought it was surely something I did wrong, but everything was nice and tight and yet it leaked. Unfortunately, it was in my bag at the moment, so it leaked all over everything. What a shame! I was really enjoying it... well until it leaked. Not sure what happened, so can't give you more details, but certainly is not something I would try again.
1	I bought this in August and here it is December with only 1 of the 5 cables still working. Definitely not worth the money.
1	Got this for the grands...even they didn't care for it.
1	These markers don’t work very well. My toddler was not impressed with the faint color it provides. The crayons are much better! (However, these are much easier to clean off!)
1	Broke within minutes.
1	It works only few minutes. It is useless. I wonder how I can return. Who charge delivery for return???
1	These both exhibit a poor fit in my phone and headphone jack. They constantly fall out and cause digital distortion. They don't seat fully in a Pixel 2.
1	I ordered this and never received my order.
1	I receive the powerstrip and when moving it around I heard something rattling around inside. Upon opening it I found one of the clips for the brackets holding the power wires in place floating around inside. I do not trust this product to hold the live AC wires in place and not short each other.
1	Chair leather was damaged when I removed it from the packaging.
1	Sits too high on my head
1	Only marking this down because I ordered 2 of the 3 packs and one of the packs was completely damaged. Emailed the company and never got a response or refund.
1	my son got this from "Santa" about a week ago, because we had to postpone our xmas due to a very large storm on xmas day here in maine. well when he opened it he was so excited and put it on immediately, when he did we found that there were 2 holes in the tail. my son was so disappointed that "santa" would send a whale tail with holes in it. i had to tell him that santa was so busy and made a mistake...he still wasnt happy and wouldnt stop crying. i am very disappointed with all the reviews on how nice it was that i got this and didnt compare to theirs. it is more expensive than the snuggie tails i figured it may be better quality, but now this momma is out her money and has to look for another one so my little man will be happy.
2	Didn't work. The heating element was too small. We had better luck with a faux-fur heated blanket.
2	Love how this phone case looks and feels but it’s crap! Don’t buy it! It falls apart all the time. After time it stretches and makes it loose on the phone.
2	Leaks around the lid. If you care about leaks do not buy.
2	The shoes came in a timely manner. Looked really nice. But they were too small... I wear size 12 and ordered a size 12. The shoes were tight on the sides. The toe part was almost rubbing. The toe guard hit my pinky toe and rubbed... a friend of mine tired them on and they felt great to him. He wears a 10.5-11 so if you do buy them buy them a size bigger maybe you fair better...
2	Sent it back. Was disappointed. Did not like material and collar was weird and so was fit of belt and bust was lower than i expected.
2	It only lasted about 2 weeks before the post broke off the earring completely. I knew it was going to happen eventually, as it was delivered with the post already bent at a 45 degree angle and I had to bend it back, at which point I noticed the post was VERY brittle. So if you need this last minute for a cosplay at a con, its great. But don't expect to be able to wear it as a daily.
2	They open weird when you rip the seal off it doesn’t come completely off and they are bulky
2	They look nice but one arrived broken. I don’t want a refund I just want a replacement.
2	Unfortunately, this made my neck itch and returned it.
2	Didn't like the fact that I couldn't get my package on time
2	Ordered an 11, box says 11, got a size 10. They seem to be in great shape, but now my daughter cant wear these for her homecoming dance.
2	This product is very easy to install, but the glass is terrible quality. I had a small area begin cracking within the first 12 hours. Then on the third day after installing, there are four separate areas around the edges that are cracking/showing a spider web effect. The phone has not been dropped or mishandled since the screen protector was applied. Waste of money, will be buying a different product.
2	I was disappointed in this one. Recipes are mediocre. The book has lots of typos and no photos. It does have nutritional information which was nice.
2	Order a two sizes up. I ordered a medium and I normally wear a small..
2	Remote control doesn’t work most of the time. Very frustrating.
2	Stuff really stinks. Gets jell like so have to warm the bottle before using the dropper
2	The unit has a buzzing noise coming from the valve behind the LED cover. I have to assume this is a defective unit. How do I file a warranty claim?
2	I was sent the wrong size shirt ordered a medium and received a large
2	Hardware didn’t even fit. Had to use original screws. Not sure what the spacers are for. At some points on the mirror I see a double image which is throwing me off. Get what you pay for I guess
2	Plants were in bad shape when they arrived. I let them sit out for 48hrs before I tried to replant them, had over 50% mortality rate. Very disappointed.
2	I was very excited when I first got them! Then I held them up to the light and realized I could see through them completely. Then when I went to try them on, there was no stretch. If I stood completely still, they fit perfect, but I could walk in them without them moving down my hips.
2	I ordered this “extra-long” plant and the plant I received is anything BUT that. It’s possibly four inches long. The leaves were broken on arrival and it is not doing well at all. Buyer beware.........
2	I have used a few different screen doors (net curtain). This one was not super easy to install and didn't snap shut until i customised the set up. At which point it worked well. Although quite flimsy. I don't have much traffic in my home yet after 2 months one of the long magnets fell out.. (see photo) the fabric is just far too weak.
2	I bought it on the 15th and its already dead on the 21st.
2	The lid came broken. Not even temperature throughout.
2	Not enough paint for some colors, and they dry up easily. But it is fun.
2	Took out the watch and everything was fine but nothing on it is working, not the small hands i cant even change the date on it either. What am i supposed to do with a broken watch like that when nothing is functioning??
2	I've had this USB drive for about four months. I reformatted it to use for different data, and it only gave me 56 GB. Formatting again didn't help. Disappointed.
2	it came broken so am sending it back. I reordered but your packing lacks protection for the feet. Please please send the next one with better packaging. Otherwise, it will go back too if broken.
2	The product is so hard to set . I'm not even sure if it works . I will play more with it and find out . I'm good with many electronics except this one is the strangest .
2	Just received...... Where do we charge ? Nice device haven't used it yet.
2	I've used this brush consistently twice a week for one year. Quite suddenly, hairs are falling out of the brush every time I go to lather it on my face.
2	Restraining leash that is built in to hold pet in place will not shorten to length required. Dog was out of the seat and hanging by his harness before I got in the drivers seat.
2	Really pretty, just wish shipping didn’t take so long. Edit: These polishes didn’t last a month, they must’ve been old or just poor quality because they were so thick and gummy. I even tried thinning them out and it didn’t work so I just got rid of them. I recommend spending a little extra to get a reliable brand.
2	What I received was not fresh and there were a ton of yellow leaves.
2	Much smaller than I expected and the fur is slightly falling out.
2	in the picture it shows that it will come in a grayish black it came in a blue
2	I would put a sippie spout on the top lid. Its akward to have to have to undo the big top, drink then put it back. The tub also sweats a lot from condensation. Include a bottom with a sweat edge that will catch condensation in future models.
2	I can't finish these. They're just not very good in my opinion. Mileage always varies between folks with protein bars so maybe it's tastier for you.
2	I need to white out text at times and this product is not very good. I usually have to rub it on, then wait until it dries, then put on a second coat. Even after that I can still see the original text.
2	The app continues to crash and wont load games. Currently i have audio but no video. just a black screen.
2	Didn't notice much of a difference
2	These used to be the best wipes. But they changes them. We had a subscription and the last time they can the packaging was blue, like in some of the other new reviews. Checked the ingredients list to see if that had changes, and they had added a couple ingredients, but they were at the end so we figured we'd at least try it. Well, my baby has never had diaper rash... We give this new one a try and she cries when we wipe with them, and got diaper rash really bad by the end of the day. Horrible! So disappointed because we loved these wipes.. also pretty upset with Amazon for still advertising them as the old ones and randomly sending us these new ones :(
2	This book has a interesting storyline but I found this book about as much fun to read as a textbook. Reading it was like slogging through a bog - it just didn't flow. If lack of proper punctuation and misuse of words (their for they're, your for you're, etc.) annoys you, don't bother with this book. I did persist until the end because I wanted to see how it played out. Guess what? There is no end. Everything is left up in the air, nothing is resolved! Ugh!
2	The protection I think would be great on this case however you can't type very well with it. I guess if you needed to just have a waterproof case that didn't require to do anything but talk on the phone, this may be a good option. Was disappointed in the lack of quality in typing that could be done.
2	The item was just what I was looking for, petite and delicate.. Unfortunately after a couple days I'm my nose or started to swell, turn red and become warm to the touch. So I took it out of my nose and tried it in my cartilage. Again after a couple of days, the same thing. So I don't know what the material is because I've never had this problem with gold.
2	really large drops in the spray cannot be used for setting makeup just ok
2	this speaker sounds ok and is loud unlike other people have said. DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO CONNECT TO MULTIPLE DEVICES AT THE SAME TIME. this was a big disappointment to me as i use in my office for my tablet and my phone at the same time. When i have it attached to my tablet it keeps skipping songs on Pandora by itself as if the button is being pressed but doesn't on my phone.
2	Really hard to see while wearing.
2	The item does not match what is in the photo. The pin provided doesn't fit the hole that has the 1.25" square tubing(no the 1.25" Square Tubing does not run the whole length of the outside tubing.)
2	Does not hold the Galaxy S9 plus phone. The phone seems to be too heavy for the stick and causes it to rotate down when attempting to use the selfie mode. I tightened it and it still just rotated downwards. It's a shame as I was very excited when I unboxed it. The tripod seemed to work just fine, but I needed it to work in the selfie mode too.
2	This is unbelievably bright even on the lowest dimmest setting. It completely lights up the room! I am returning it since I was looking for a clock that you can read but won't light up the room.
2	Wack. Took forever to arrive and the puffy fur started falling all over my room after a few days.
2	This reader was hoping for incisive analysis from a former Secretary of State. Instead this is a sentimental reminisce of well known events in the long civil rights struggle. I don't know if it was ghost written. There is nothing sparkling in the style and nothing revelatory about the events described.
2	The product works well, the problem is the failure that came with the case. It is marked by the pressure of the magnet.
2	Broke within a month or two. Not good quality.
2	It arrived in a beat up box with holes in it. One nut and bolt was missing ( had to a trip to the hardware store ) . The stand is pretty sturdy , I don't like the plastic top everything slides off it . I wanted to use it to hold a mixer , maybe .
2	This product did NOT work.
2	It would be a great product if they all worked. Replaced the “M” but my printer keep beeping & not letting me print anything, them replace it again same thing happened.
2	it is NOT leather, it's just plastic and has a weird smell too ! I was easily able to scratch off the "leather" off of it with my fingernail !
2	Three of them did not work.
2	The fine sands sticks to my cat's paws and she will trace it all over the floor. That causes dusts and when it gets wet,,,, even worse! It starts smelling funky as soon as I replace with the new sand. ( it is more a sand smell, not my cat's) I still get the regular Double Duty one.
2	We didn’t realize this product is for an aquarium. Probably more our mistake.
2	Way too tight around the hips and too long around your lady bits
2	After less than 2 months the clasp broke and have not been able to contact the company for a replacement item.
2	This adapter last almost 2 months. Longer than others I tried but still unacceptably short life.
2	I have had a lot of LITOM solar lights and most have been great but this is the worst !! The 1200Mah batt needs hours and hours of direct sun to work for more than 3-4 hours on the dim to bright setting when motion is detected. It is now in the trash and have ordered a different brand.
2	I ordered a pair in white, and wore them just a short while before they started getting uncomfortable. I washed them, and now there are yellowish blotches on them. I'll try bleach, and hopefully that will come out.
2	it is quite durable looking but the colors were is a little dull and did not look as classy as the images.
2	This wig is worth the price; you will have to use gel and make some snips to make it look like the picture the seller shows. I dislike false advertising-rather disgusting. The back of the wig will lift off your head and look like a hawk in full flight. I saw people staring at the back of my head and laughing.
2	No were close to 4C hair! Clip ins are very thin.
2	Over all these are a sturdy option for wireless earbuds, however the sound quality is not great. Very little bass. There are probably better options for the price.
2	Keys did not sink up to ignition. Only good to unlock door but the key fob can do that
2	Unfortunately this rice cooker broke after only a few uses.
2	I used this pillow for a few months before it separated width wide. Now it has 2 parts. I’m pretty disappointed with the product. I thought if I spent a little more it would be a good pillow. Not so!
2	It came in fast and the shipping box was in mint condition but for the product I ordered that’s a different story. When ordering I was hoping for by ordering something new the packaging would be in great or even better mint condition for being a collector of sorts but it looks like it took an old school WWF Attitude era beat down, very disappointed. The figure it’s self looks excellent and in good condition, in the end I’d rather been told upfront that it was in a damaged package and it was at least $6 less than what I payed.
2	If you have the ability to have this on PC do yourself a favor and get it on that. The console experience spoils a fantastic game. On the PS4 the frames dropped below 20, the game would pause and take more than a second to register what you wanted your characters to do. The loading times were down right annoying. Wait for your mission to start, wait for another loading screen to finish creating the map, then wait for you to just start playing and if you have to load another save it repeats all over again. If you have the option do yourself a favor and play this game on a computer.
2	Broke within the first week,
2	The white base is very sturdy and as described and perhaps I didn't read it correctly but know that it does not come with the bulb so therefore you have to find your own.
2	The length on this charge cable was nice but it wasn't very durable. Mine broke a couple of months after being used. The cord where it connects to the plug broke off. I'm always careful when plugging and unplugging so I didn't get how it broke so fast.
2	If you sleep by yourself it's ok. But if you sleep with someone else, you roll together, and with it being memory foam even if you move away the indent is still there and you just slide back together. It also gets really hot. Even with the "gel" it seems to hold heat, and can get uncomfortably warm. Maybe if I went with a smaller thickness.
2	Very light weight with no backing. Will not put them on an expensive blazer
2	There’s a hole in the sleeve and the turtle neck was awkwardly loose
2	After 16 days it stopped working! LOVED THE LENGTH! But will never buy again due to only working for a short amount of time
2	Paper and cover are nice quality, but the way the binding is attached to the cover is horrible. The first page and last page are essentially a small amount of glue being held together by one piece of paper, the whole cover fell off from the pages within 9 pages of mild usage.
2	Not an easy chair for my 14 month old to get in and out of because of the table. Poor design, also the screws that come with it to assemble don’t hold up well. Wish I could have returned it
2	Cute idea, for a dog that doesn't chew up stuff. My lab had this torn apart in less than 2 hours. I bought it because it had the KONG label, and I made the assumption that it would be less destructible than it was because it was a KONG product. This would be perfect for dogs that truly don't chew stuff, I've just never owned one that didn't at least thrash toys around.
2	Grill didn't fit securely and once I tried to snap it in place a clip broke off.
2	The motor cover projects too far over the treadmill itself and if you are walking and holding on to the handles it is too easy to trip over it. We had to return it to Amazon which has been an ordeal unto itself unfortunately.
2	The Bluetooth reception is rather good, but there is a very loud and constant static when pairing that is not there with a wired connection. I tried cleaning the aux output and then resetting the device, which made it unusable altogether since it is stuck blinking red and blue lights. I initially got this because I was impressed with the different capabilities of the device, but after using it, I am unlikely to purchase any product from the manufacturer unless I am in the market for something that flashes red and blue lights on a five hour battery.
2	Wrinkled all over. Would have been good if firm.
2	Really did not work to deter not enthusiastic wood pecker.
2	The size chart is way off. Not sure if anyone is monitoring the 'Size Chart' link vs. the sizes offered for selection. I selected an XXL because the size chart says an XL is a US size 8. I needed a US size 10 or 12. Well, the shirt is exactly what you would expect a typical XXL might be. It's very confusing as I've ordered some of these Chinese made shirts before. Sizing is all over the map -- sometimes they follow the size chart and sometimes they are the actual letter size. Makes it very difficult to guess which one it might be. Wanted a few new tops for my niece and of the 6 Chinese-made tops I ordered, only one fit. It's a waste of time to wait for them and then to have to send them back due to this type of error.
2	I got this wallet around two years ago and initially really loved it - it is very convenient and holds everything you would need for travel. However, when I used it again on my last trip I noticed that the entire lining became very sticky and left a sticky film on everything I had in the pockets (including credit cards, money, passport, etc.). I did not spill anything in the wallet or leave it in a particularly hot area that would have caused it to melt. I also only used the wallet when travelling abroad, so in two years it only had a few uses. Although i really liked it when I first got it, it's basically useless now because everything I put in it comes out gross. Very disappointed!
2	I'ts a beautiful picture and vibrant colors...BUT, The diamonds won't stick. Disappointed
2	I was initially happy with this product. The only major ding against them was the battery life. They tended to last 5-6 hours instead of the advertised 10. But to be honest, I never actually expected a full 10 hours anyway. Battery life claims are universally exaggerated. This product was no exception. Over the past 12 months, that already-iffy battery life got even shorter. This past weekend the headphones died altogether. They won't charge and they won't turn on. It's not like I overused the headphones, either. Since my purchase 12 months ago I estimate I have used them fewer than 50 times. Compared to people who practically live with buds in their ears, that's nothing. I don't expect miracles, but I do expect more from a product like this. I won't purchase another product from this company any time soon.
2	Many of the flower petals were falling off as I opened the package. Not that life like. I don't think they'll hold up outside in the wind. If you have an indoor planter where people can't get close, ok.
2	Fits pretty small and the fabric is not the quality I expected.
2	Not getting any foam. When this is attached to my pressure washer it takes away most of the power. I assume I must be doing something incorrectly. albeit I haven't figured it out yet. Have used hot water mixing half and half with car soap. Might try different soap but when compared to online videos the foam is coming out at a greater force than on mine. I'm using a 1500 psi pressure washer. Minimum required in description is 1000 psi.
2	Nothing like the stuff that comes in the box. Think sharp vs mild
2	I’m not into thongs thought I’d give these a shot. They’re comfortable as far as thongs go- I prefer g strings wanted to try thongs. Front pouch coverage deceiving cuz the only photo with a model allegedly wearing one shows a much narrower front pouch- I like minimal coverage I wouldn’t have bought these if I saw there was so much fabric in front. That being said, I like the waistband sides are like string bikini and tail is comfortable would’ve gave it 5 stars if front was narrow like the 1 photo of model allegedly wearing it
2	The comb is nice, but the scissors are crap. They do not function smoothly, there is too much friction while operating them. Hard to explain, but as if they are catching on something when trying to open/close them, if that makes sense. Feels like faulty manufacturing.
2	The pour spout seems to have some secret means to drip everywhere regardless of how careful I am. I have an older version of this 2-cup measuring cup that does NOT drip like this. Otherwise nice enough.
2	This was very cheaply made. Very thin material, not at all as cozy as my other carrier hoodie. Big gap around where baby’s head comes out so it’s not very warm.
2	Playing with the switch in handheld mode, using this product has a lot of input delay.
2	While they stuck they were good but then they all fell down
2	When I placed this outside the cage there was a small gap where the bottom didn’t touch the cage. Seeds still got all over the floor.
2	One of the four arrived broken. There is no way to contact seller to get one replacement.
2	I've been buying these vitamins since 2014 and I have always bought 150 count. When I got my bottle today, it said 120 on it yet was going for the same price as the 150 tabs. Also the vitamins look different than my previous bottle (see picture). What is the deal?
2	Broke....had to return it....but it was a funny shirt
2	When the 3/4 power step were to low an arch I briefly tried them and put them back in box. Checked the return box and filled out requested info but no response on return.
2	The corners don't fit well. Getting ready to return the band. I ordered new fit watch. 3rd try to found the right band.
2	I like the earbuds bcuz the are small & comfortable. They were easy ro pair. The only thing I don’t like about the earbuds is that I haven’t has them for long & already the right earbud doesn’t work. Which stinks because that’s the one tou need ro talk on the phone.
2	The quality is great but if for some reason you shake it the cards drop... Hope you improve it.
2	Pretty but slips and slides. Very light weight. No backing to speak of.
2	I don't know why the book say Amazon Rentals when I purshased the book I send the picture of the book
2	I bought the dark chocolate and the milk chocolate was mailed to me
2	The product did not communicate with my garage door., although my learn button is yellow on a Extreme Garage unit
2	The product is excellent minus a few points when I tried to answer a call and the caller couldn't hear me. After a few months the right earbud stopped retracting and I tried filing a claim with Asurion, which they just passed on insuring it and said contact the manufacturer, but now I have no phone number or person of contact.... thanks a lot.
2	As soon as I pulled them out of the package the limbs started breaking not all of them But a few
2	My 8 pound dog destroyed this in about an hour
2	Did not help remove the rounded bolts. In fact it just rotated around the bolt even though I used power tools to tighten this device tightly onto the bolt. Then there is the required need of extra space just to fit the device which makes using it a bit tricker in most tight spaces. I would not recommend it.
2	The battery life is incredible, but the device make a weird beeping sound when playing audio. The mic has no noise cancellation. Fits like normal earbuds.
2	Received yesterday charged all day today and 2 dont work.
2	My screen cracked after a few days with this case. The case isn’t durable itself either. The plastic has chipped on all of the corners.
2	Well made for what it is ---- but what it is is cheap plastic. Sent it back.
2	Really didn't work for me
2	I like the finish on the product however the real issue was the size. I expected it to be larger like another one i have but it’s thin and tinier. Since i already put it together i have to make due /: just check to make sure it’s the size you need
2	I love matcha. I believe I am addicted to it. Typically I have two matcha lattes in the morning, and its like jet fuel that energizes and motivates all day. I got this one trying to save some money. Everyone is different, I suppose, but I really don't like this. Compared to others I bought, it tastes awful, in my view. As the item is non-returnable (I accidently ordered another one :-( ), rather than throwing it out, which was my first impulse, I am keeping it to experiment with it in cooking. Will update as I add it to recipes. It may become a welcome ingredient - who knows?
2	Good product but doesn’t fit all inner wheels check before you purchase
2	The paper is fine quality, but super disappointed in the packaging. It arrived with the plastic wrap completely torn off and many of the sheets are bent on the corners.
2	The digital numbers stop working on the read out , now it’s a guessing game on the amperage
2	My mattress is 7” and not 8” as described. Mattress was vacuum sealed and no way we can pack this back to return this.
2	The case itself is decent. The fingerprint unlock does not work with screen case. Attempted numerous times. It will work on screen but not when in the case.
2	Box was damaged. With medication products, I prefer not to have damaged packaging. Won't buy from this supplier again.
2	After 3 days or so it fell by itself avoid this. 15 dollars thrown to the trash
2	The clock radio was great at first but the display has stopped working after a month and a half of use. I'd be happy to change my review if the company can fix this or send a replacement. I haven't been able to contact them yet.
2	Very hard to use because it's too wide for your braces to really move around. Gonna use mine since I bought them and suffer the uncomfortableness. But won't purchase again. Great "idea" though.
2	They fit my 2005 M50 with no problem. Screwed right in. First problem, the lines on the lens, the left side is parallel with the ground, the right side is 45 degrees off. Makes the bike look funny when looking at it. Second problem, after 3 months and 3k miles, one of the smoke lenses popped off the "chrome" part. I think I will just invest in LED's next time.
2	They are very leaky. Very hard to control how much paint to use
2	Starting to fall apart after a couple months
2	I am sure it might work for you
2	This is a good looking case that stands up very nicely. Unfortunately, the corners broke off after a couple of months, rendering it useless.
2	More buttons which add shine to the jacket than I thought. In the picture the jacket looks clean but in reality...too many brings (something which I personally don't like)
2	They are heavy for swimsuit and really don’t do much
2	Don't bother - almost think they don't make different sizes in this shoe, esp. if you're a sz. 9 or up. Tried twice via two sellers and ordering two different sizes got the same shoe each time...never fit. Wasted effort. Can't speak to the durability, but note it is a heavy shoe.
2	Instructions are incomplete. No instructions nor images to show how to add cards. You say above "Shoppers find images and videos more helpful than text alone." So do purchasers, but alas, nothing here.
2	Like most, we learned to love these little candies in Italy where the are manufactured during the winter months. Unfortunately, I have yet to figure out how to enjoy them back in the USA. I have ordered them from 2 different vendors on AMAZON and, in both cases, they arrive with a crystallized or leaking liquid center (the coffee). Simply, they have an extremely short shelf life and are very sensitive to temperature extremes. If anyone knows a vendor who can provide a fresh product, please advise - many of us would like to know.
2	most of the product was empty. pigment not so intense.
2	The temps do not match what other temps give. I would hit a spot first time it is once temp the next time it is a totally different temp and never has given close to same temp twice. Next time ill spend a little more money to get a better product.
2	ok until it fell off the wall and broke.... cheap fogged up a lot, hard to read.
2	This was poorly written, my ebook had multiple editing errors. The plot was boring and typical. I go into romance/erotic books knowing that it's going to be played out but there was nothing about this book that stood out to me.
2	These brooches are not ideal for making an all brooch bouquet. They maybe ideal to adhere to flowers for a combination bouquet as I did.
2	I absolutely love the look of this. I’m sad to say that it constantly was popping off and I finally lost it. I’m tempted to order another one hoping it was just a fluke that it didn’t snap on super tight but probably won’t.
2	In general the image is good, I only paid 80 bucks for this projector, but if you pay the full price, you can find a few better options for a better quality image and a more silent unit for the same price. Honestly, the fan is LOUD and awful, if you use the unit in a noisy environment then is not a problem.
2	The product was doing well for a few months and then suddenly it stopped working. The part which you step on to create pressure in the tank stopped working and filled up with water.
2	Very disappointed with the packaging. FedEx driver handing me a thin plastic bag with no protection at all. Box was ripped and had some dents on the corner of the battery.
2	QC issues all the way around. The first order I cancelled was charged and sent anyways and the order I did want came in wrong. emblem itself looks pretty good though.
2	Sensor Wayyyyyy to sensitive.looks nice
2	The batteries came in 5 small boxes of 4 batteries, but the outside box says 24 batteries so it should have been 6 boxes of 4. Are these fake, why would each box state 24 and only 20 batteries were included. Others have the same comment. Anyone know why the small boxes of 4 are put in another boxes than states 24 and not 20? The product description states 20 so I got 20, but it seems the batteries have been repackaged.
2	tree too small, my wife didn't like it.
2	I bought this hoping it would be more like the Wrangler Riggs work jacket. Sadly, it was of significantly poorer quality, had only buttons rather than a zipper front, the hood fabric was very thin, and the size (I ordered a 2x) was way too small, more like a Large, with very short sleeves. I returned the jacket.
2	It is poorly made. It hold water when it rains and rusts. The height did not really work for me. A waste of money.
2	The length is great. But, the mechanics used to squeeze the jaw is extremely stiff and it's difficult to get the jaw to close and grip tight on whatever you are moving (see picture) It's all plastic and feels like it's gonna break. I would return it, but I've already used it.
2	They seemed fine at first but smell like urine when the dog chews them. Odor is noticable without getting very close.
2	Did not work once it was in the water . the pouch camp opening up letting water in thank God my phone is waterproof
2	Very inaccurate for marking
2	I dislike the fact I have only received 5 pair of socks vice the 7 I paid for with this transaction.
2	I bought two of these mugs, and idk why this black mug sounds like it has sand inside it. The other one, a golden one, is just perfect it also comes in a travel bag
2	Bad fit and dead spots on the screen
2	I purchase this item June 22, and it stopped working four months later. It does not charge.
2	This toilet paper ran out really fast, it was thick but didn’t last long.
2	Owned this item for a couple year now. Cute novelty gift, but very poorly designed/executed. The batteries are very difficult to install. Display blanks out some numbers about once a week, usually clears up after you cycle through modes. Overall - Meh.
2	All the main features work (power, volume, input select) . The menu select only has BT pair so it cannot adjust bass, treble, night mode, or any of the other features the soundbar may have.
2	Nice but not what i espected.is just some liquid with sparkles.The smell is nice by the way
2	Portability is really the only thing this keyboard has going for it. It has an awkward layout, slides all over the place when typing, and it pretty much non functional for any productive tasks.
2	Would never sync to the hourly chimes. Extremely frustrating and not worth the exchange.
2	I’m not so sure about this. The directions say let it run for thirty seconds. Mine only runs for about four. I’m still looking in stores for them.
2	Its been two weeks, still have not received. would not recommend
2	First, these are so expensive for some small, cheap, plastic drawers. But they came to me very dirty and had scrapes that I can’t get off. If it wasn’t for the scrapes and the expensive price for such small drawers, I would have liked them more.
2	I wanted to return, as it was described as shag plush rug. but were going to charge me $10 to ship back. this is not cool... Item not as described, I should be able to return on their dime... buyer beware
2	Worked well for first hour or so but then started clogging and sputtering. Had to water down the paint so much that it was really runny. Can't get into the nozzle to clean it out. Finally went back to brushing because we were changing the heads so frequently.
2	This particular Pop! is of lower quality, which explains why it was an "add-on". You can see the glue at the back of Benny's head, and the paint job on his face is less than stellar. Just goes to show, you get what you pay for. I will not be buying something as an "add-on" again.
2	This product is attractive, but it doesn't do what I thought it would from the description. They show it being used as a backsplash, on countertops, etc. I only wanted to use it to cover a wooden box that I used to stand a mannequin on in my shop. It sticks, but just barely. If you bump it or something brushes against it, it comes loose. So I pulled it off and used it on the floor of the cabinet under the sink, and it does okay for that. I cannot image it being sturdy enough to be a backsplash or a counter cover.
2	The plastic connectors are terrible. They leak.
2	This is a beautiful and challenging puzzle. Sadly, when we got just two pieces away from completing it, we discovered that two pieces were missing. Two other pieces were duplicates. Reading the reviews, I discovered that this seems to be a problem with this puzzle. I returned it for a full refund. It is very frustrating to spend hours on a puzzle and not be able to complete it. Also, the pieces are not interlocking, so assembled pieces come apart easily. A shame since this is one of the most beautiful designs of a puzzle we have seen.
2	I want to love this shirt I really do... When I first got it had a very strong odor to it. So I decided to wash it before using it on my son for his 2nd birthday party. After washing it there were several cracks in the truck where green fabric show through. I'm still going to use it because it's only for one day however for the $15 I paid I expected it to make it at least a few washes... Oh well it's still cute and the truck made my guy happy
2	Necklace attractive but was too tight, may be smaller than 16"
2	I ordered these because the picture and description specifically indicated that they were for the Fusion Proglide (NOT Fusion 5 Proglide). The Fusion 5 Proglide cartridges do not fit the older Fusion Proglide handle. The service was good in terms of shipping (which is why I bumped the rating up from one star), but please update your product picture and description so that it is not misleading to others, as it was to me.
2	My physical key didn't transfer over well. The spring action never smoothly allowed key open when I pressed the button. Everything else lined up smoothly with the chip / board inside and felt of good quality. Still need one sadly.
2	The product is quite nice but the description lacked a size for the inner pot and that turned out to be not much larger than my 3 qt. double boiler.
2	Love these bars, but I ordered the variety pack and i got a weird variety pack with flavors I've never had and don't really like. Upset.
2	Super thick, good coverage, way too oily. I don’t have acne prone skin but I broke out with this. Also need to wash your face several times to remove completely
2	The perforation between each bag in the roll is not quite finished so tearing each bag from the next is more of a ripping effect than breaking clean away. Other than that they are not bad.
2	The light tape is fine, but when ordering, nothing is said up front that there is not an adaptor included. Luckily, I had some adapters that I could use. This should be in the product description.
2	It dries out too fast but it it's good for a glass fountain pen I would not recommend it to use the refillable cartridge on this because it will dry out in it and you will have to Queen.
2	I have ordered this twice now in TEAL and each time I’ve received a light blue!! I’m including a pic of what I get as TEAL,and this is not the picture shown for TEAL!! I’d very much like to get the Teal if you have any ideas?!
2	I've taken many pump powders. This one has been the least effective. Notice no difference at all in the form of pump nor endurance. also, you cannot mix this with a preworkout as its very sweet on its own. the taste itself is rather good.
2	This is how I received my order. Great reviews, but unfortunately poor delivery and/or packaging.
2	The pattern is similar, but still quite different and disappointing. The colors are dull and not nearly as vibrant as those displayed on the website. I would not have made the purchase if I was aware that I would not receive this throw..
2	The product would likely be good if it didn’t arrive having been previously melted or melt in shipping. Just ruins the quality. Messy upon opening because the chocolate coating has been ruined.
2	The trunks are fine when new. However, within 4 months of normal use (I swim 2-3 times a week at a pool), my black trunks have faded into a strange green color.
2	it didn't work to good
2	I was so excited to get this classic movie and show it at school, but the case came pretty cracked leaving sharp edges. The dvd plays, but the case is ruined. Nothing else in the shipping box was damaged, so I’m tempted to believe that the case was damaged before shipping.
2	None of my earrings fit through the holes. So disappointed
2	Used 3 drops in diffuser, no smell.Put 10 drops in diffuser and could barely smell it. Won't buy this product again. Not strong enough.
2	Wanted to like it but the smell of this material was very strong - almost mildewy like - and it also did not fit comfortably across my body. which is why I returned it. Unfortunate, but I would not recommend this.
2	Worked twice. Then did not. Neither with plug adapter of batteries.
2	Window shades keep falling off the window. Don't stick very well or at all. Trying to figure out in purchasing suction cups so shades can stay up. Waste of mone
2	I bought this for my wife and while she loves the scent, it does not last for more than 1 hour.
2	look great but all bulbs burned out exactly 4 months after purchase - no indication of warranty
2	It says that it is stainless steel, I used it on my boat just once, and went to use it again 3 days later, and it was already full of rust, I guess the stainless steel is poor quality..
2	Weren’t as big as I thought
2	Poor design. not only is it corded only (Which I get), but it uses a Bluetooth USB loose cable, so the chances of it unplugging from either end are greater. Only viable for very confined setups. There's better options.
2	I really like this sweatshirt. It fits well and is very soft. I’ve had it for a few months and always wash and try it on normal cycles with no problems. Until I accidentally wash and dried it inside out. The lettering fused together and rips when I try to separate it. So after a few wears it’s completely ruined. 😔 I’m so bummed.
2	I send it back, the ped was stiched in the worng place. I hope it was a mistake because the fabric it self was good and it fit great.
2	Didnt give me the wave i was hoping for, too late to return it now :(
2	make spark when changing the number for fan. bought two but need to return the other one. I just don't have time to remove it and return the one already installed. wouldn't recommend this for any one.
2	Box and table were damaged. Some reviews said this seats 6, which would be a really tight fit. Will seat 4 comfortable. Medium weight.
2	The material isn’t that good it still shows off every dent nook and cranny even if you wear another dress over it.
2	Not very sturdy, works fine with slippers, sneakers though.
2	These are very soft and cute but they're kind of tight and the bridge does not extend enough, so it's hard to wear them like you're supposed to without messing up your hair, but if you have a small head these would be perfect!
2	Bought the set as I had 160 holes I needed in some support braces. Using the 1 7/8" bit, I was able to drill them but noticed halfway through that the edge on two of the 4 carbide edges had chipped. Given the soft wood I was using, I'm concerned about the durability of this set. This bit still left a flat hole as the other two edges were still intact. Kept the set but am not impressed.
2	The noise cancelling works fairly well. The problem I have with the black pair of the ear plugs is that I could not get them out of my ears. The center stem was too short to get a good hold of. I had the get a smal pair of needle nose pliers to pull them out of my ears. The other pair wasn’t bad. I actually expected something a little more heavy duty. It’s a nice carrying case but the plugs I can’t really give a good rating.
2	ended up returning these, the material feels much better than the faux leather ones but these just are not very comfortable at all to me. I'd stick with the 6mm one and put one of their covers over that much more comfortable
2	The bottom portion of the razor holder is not bent enough to hold the razor in place. Shower door shuts and the razor falls.
2	Bulbs are bright as advertised. But in a batch of 72 about 6 have already burned out. I see the comment about them being in enclosed but they are burning out in non enclosed
2	Handle was bent over when it arrived due to how it was shipped. Base of item is cardboard, so may not be very durable. I hoped to put the OXO wipes dispenser in one side (it fits) but I could see that it would weigh down that side and bend the cardboard more. Returned.
2	Lacked of functionality
2	The fire starting component is butts.
2	Heap looking founders. Didn’t even look as good as a cheap drugstore set
2	Not such a fan of this mixer. Bought this to make cookies this Christmas season and it can barely get through some butter and flower. Very weak mixer
2	Perhaps I didn’t pay enough attention to what this product is made to do, but for me, all it did was add weight and grease. There is no additional lift, no definition.
2	Looks like a neat little trailer but the product was cracked and needed extensive structural repairs. Appears it was dropped during or prior to shipment. Shame on you Amazon
2	Like the look. Can not figure out music function. Instructions are vague at best.
2	Took a long time to get it and it runs too small
2	I LOVE the cup, but the lid leaked from day 1 and you can't take the lid apart to wash it. They need to provide better lids.
2	It was cute, I’m plus size and this fit bad. Bug in the top because I’m short and tight and unflattering.
2	I like the sturdiness of the case but in just a week the stand ring became too loose to use to stand up my phone from any angle. If it wasn’t for the fact that amazon Has become too cheap to send FedEx UPS directly to pick up items of this price from my home even though I’m a prime member, I would have returned or exchanged this. Very disappointed. I had better performance from a cheap promotional pop socket in terms of durability of the stand.
2	I was hoping this would be a sharper instrument but it was not. Disappointed
2	Nice a glass sticker it’s on the entire screen but the glass is not so clean..
2	Pain to take. It seems that every product wants you to take it on an empty stomach. Not going to do it.
2	The picture shows the earrings as ovals but they are circles.
2	Bought this in Feb 2017 as a replacement to the faucet I installed Feb 2014. First one slowly clogged with relatively soft water. Second one lost the on/off button in 6 months of very minimal use.
2	Didn’t realize it was a refurbished machine. The filter was full of dog hair when I received it .
2	This brush pushes hair to one side where one can then vacuum it up to a certain extent. But, I found that it missed too many hairs that are deeply embedded in cloth. I also found that if I got a small plastic dish with water and dipped my finger tips into the water repeatedly, my fingers worked much better than this brush at getting hair out. Perhaps, in a wetter climate, this brush might work better. I really wanted this brush to work after reading all of the positive reviews, but it has been pretty much a bust.
2	Just received these in the mail and will say that these look really nice and seem durable. As a few others have mentioned, I compared charging speeds and they do charge very slow. Another thing I didn’t like was that they wiggle by the charging port with may or may not mean that the charging speeds are affect but enough to question it. I will be returning them and possible look for a fast charger.
2	The straps are too narrow to fit the very wide strap mounts. The strap mounts looked crooked and misaligned. Very disappointed in this camera and the fact I'll have to carry my camera in my hands at all times during this trip.
2	Supposed to be compatible and not machine specific. The characters work fine but the Spider-man playset (world) does NOT work with Disney Infinity 3.0. Disappointed our 7 and 6-yr old boys. Too bad.
2	It seriously smells terrible!! If it didn’t smell like it does it works just fine but honestly dislike using it because the smell lingers long after use.
2	I purchased this in a small and it's massive. Even after washing and drying it trying to shrink it it's still too big. I gave it to my friend who normally wears size medium and it was even too big for him. The quality seems fine otherwise. It smelled strongly of chemicals when removed from the package.
2	I love the fact that it comes with a lens cap I just wished the lens would stay on the piece that slides. My wide angle fell apart completely and not from heavy use. Definitely a good product idea just cheap materials
2	It take to long to get
2	I tried using the iron twice, and it leaked! Even on the high 'Cotton' setting, I wasn't able to steam the pillowcases: they were being soaked with water. It was returned. The hidden cord wrap was a feature that I liked for storage.
2	I was very happy with this charger up until now. It’s just stopped working, not even 3 months after purchase. There’s no rips or anything physically wrong with it, it shows the charging symbol on my phone but it’s not giving it any juice. I had it on the charger overnight and my battery is 44%. Not too impressed.
2	It lights up but on day two it would only change colors right when i turned it on then after a few weeks it wont change colors att all. It red and only red now.
2	Disappointed in description of product
2	Darkening effect went out once during use right in the middle of welding. (No, that wasn't scary at all *sarcasm* ... and a little blinding). The screen does not work at all like it should. I find I have to hit the top part just above the screen most every time I use it. The screen will flicker before coming on. Sometimes it will release back to normal visibility. Sometimes. If it doesn't ... *whack!* to get it to stand down. The battery compartment has come apart along the top as the battery cover is a severe PITA to remove. (Removed battery to check it to make it wasn't dying and causing the problems). Save your money. Get something better
2	It's not very practical.
2	Cheap, plastic came bent. Not a very good scratch sensation when compared with other backscratchers. Very small in size
2	The product picture is of three discs but only one arrives. SO FRUSTRATING!
2	They run small at least one-two sizes smaller. Ordered a 36 waist. More like a 32. Sadly will have to return them
2	I bought this to feed the cat when we are away for weekends. It seemed to work but sometime on the weekend some other animal (probably a raccoon) got into it and ate all the food in the hopper. Fortunately a friend came by to check on things and noticed it was toppled over and empty. So would work indoors e.g. for a person with unpredictable work schedules or the like, but not as an outdoor feeder.
2	It advertised for an electric set and it was battery.
2	not made really well
2	The plastic around the edge broke at the headphone jack within a few weeks. Cheap and not worth it.
2	it worked good for a few months then the pump got clogged. I looked up ways to fix but I still could not get it to work
2	Honestly, I don't fell any different. I have no idea if there is any benefit to taking the product after 30 days.
2	I bought my first two of these at Walmart for really competitive prices, lost one when I left it in a Tokyo Hotel. Couldn’t find them anywhere over here so ordered these from Amazon, and had them shipped to my PO Box. I wish I hadn’t of. First they are about an ounce or two smaller than the ones I bought at WalMart secondly, since one of them is defective, in a big unusable way, for just one useable one, it was really expensive. I do not reccomend that you get these from Amazon. I might be able to find a new flange for the one with the defective lid, but I am not sure how, or where, and sending them back from overseas seems a pretty big hassle. It leaks like a sieve. Totally unusable.
2	The salt shaker has 1 hole and the pepper has 3. So it takes FOREVER to salt your food.
2	I've handled many different HDDs for a long time and I've never seen one kick the bucket so suddenly and with less provocation. I get it, not every HDD ships perfect. Never had to deal with Seagate support before, so hoping this goes smoothly and I can update this review in a few months with something more positive.
2	Great design, however I was shorted a few bags.
2	The adhesive does not work at all. It stayed up once for the car ride and wouldn’t stick after that. Huge disappointment because the rest of it works but pretty useless when it can’t stay stuck so it’s always falling over
2	These were nice at first but I've only had them a month and the lights are different colors like ones white and other is off white. Finally today one just completely went out.
2	This stevia powder is not very sweet. I have to use 3 times the amount I use with other brands of pure stevia and it is still only mildly sweetened.
2	This item had lots of positive reviews but I didn’t have a very good experience with it. We had 20+ 10-11 year old boys to play capture the flag for a birthday party. One orb kept stopped working which was basically a game stopper. The wristbands don’t stay on and would frequently break. I spend so much time dealing with the wristbands that don’t work well and unsnap easily then break. The markers also didn’t all work correctly and took about 20+ minutes to get some to work. This has good potential but the quality of the products is low. After spending $90 for the main kit and expansion I was quite disapppointed
2	I did not get the nuts or bolts any of the hardware that came with itI wrote a review about it and have never heard back I need the bolt that screws into the skill saw
2	I am disappointed that my stool came damaged. About 20% of the seats rim is dented. The legs appear to be sturdy; but, the material on the top is cheaply made.
2	I did not like it at all. It was watery and the color was yellowish and not a great consistency or coverage. Not at all what it was advertised as.
2	It does not work with my Fire TV Stick, only with the Fire TV. Like the old YouTube App.
2	Over all these headphones work well. But with my experience the cord is a very rubbery material that bounces around a lot which causes a lot of noise for the person on the other side of the phone call. Sitting still and\or listening to music is great tho. I was also disappointed that the mic is now having trouble picking up sounds after just a few months which is sad as I really loved these for listening to music
2	Package was damaged and torn open. Spilled out in box . Poor packaging with loss of product.
2	Ok, so I bought these gloves for work. I just needed something to keep my hands warm and dry. Not really doing anything but being in the rain. After about 30 minutes or so I notice my hands are getting wet. Their warm still but wet. So I switched pairs since I bought them in a two pack. Same thing happened. They say "water proof" right on them. But my hands where soaked in only the rain. They are not water proof or even water resistant for more than the briefest of contact with water. I should have been able to submerge them in water and still be dry to be water proof as advertised. In my book these are a fail for water proof/ resistant gloves.
2	Nice material but I wear 16/18 40 DDD and ordered a 6x it’s very tight on my chest but fits my stomach
2	It's way to big for my daughter who's a toddler. I tried using it once and I find it to be very uncomfortable...I'm comparing it to a Brookstone travel pillow.
2	Loved the look and still use it but the little wool hook broke immediately
2	cannot operate this without using 2 hands. doesnt that defeat the point of using it in the car? I didnt realize how difficult it would be to mount it with a pop socket on the back, too
2	Would have liked directions. No clue how to attach loose strap and whether to use, when, and how.
2	The pages inside are a low quality, if I had seen the inside I wouldn’t have purchased it.
2	These worked for a while and now several of the markers just don't work. They are runny and do not look like chalk at all.
2	I used this along with the Biotin shampoo and my hair did not feel soft after each shower.
2	Poor toaster. Would only toast on one side and could not get dark enough returned it. We did like the color however
2	These were very easy to install and fit my draperies on them. What I dislike is the back rod doesn't stay in place on one end. Those foam holders you use does NOT keep rod in place on one end. I've tried contacting the rod maker for help but the page won't load. Not impressed at all with this company.
2	Shelf came in warped and one of the arms was longer than the other. Also, one of the nuts keeps spinning on the arm. Went ahead and hung it anyway. Looks nice in design and color, just has the flaws I have mentioned.
2	The item arrived damaged so I returned it. The broom is easy to assemble and the quality looks fine but i did not order a replacement because the dust pan holder was not weighted, so it requires manual adjustment for opening and closing. Perhaps it was new but that was my deciding factor
2	Wrist support is too low, it is like not having one
2	My rabbit is 6 years old and free rage, so he is well potty trained. I wanted to replace his old cage with a new one. He only uses his cage as a litter box. He will not use this cage because of the wire floor. I was reluctant to buy this cage because of this feature. I ultimately bought it because I thought if he was only using it for the bathroom it would be a quick in and out and wouldn’t hurt his feet. Bottom line: WIRE BOTTOM CAGES ARE NOT GOOD FOR ANY RABBITS OR OTHER ANIMALS. Especially if this cage is more than just a litter box. Do NOT purchase this cage as a rabbit home, because it is way to small for a proper rabbit home.
2	Looks cheaply made. Stripes are not black, but more of a dark shimmery purple. The stripes look like they were printed on to the plastic case, but it was printed on crooked. Definitely would not buy again!
2	I ordered this for my 5 year old and it was a waste of money. It didn’t last long and it’s very light so once’s it drops you can kiss this baby good bye. May be it would better suit an older more mature kid.
2	Fishing rod came damaged
2	Unlike me others may want to note the dimensions. To me this is not a helpful size for an adult cat to get full stretch n scratch. Disappointed
2	Very thin and not warm. Spend a little more money and get a good blanket
2	also can't be returned, sadly
2	poor quality, most of them fell apart before take off.
2	Never received the product but was issue a refund. Hence the two stars.
2	I like the looks of this clock and the led lights up nice in the dark.
2	I don't know if it's the steelseries keyboard or if I have a defective model, but various keys have stopped working or work only sometimes. Even as I am typing this review I have to copy/paste every 'L' character I use because pressing the keyboard simply doesn't work. I am very disappointed in this laptop. I guess I've learned my lesson for wanting gaming AND portability, it's just not feasible at this price point so they must have cut costs when it comes to the keyboard.
2	Gave these a solid try but it’s just not for me
2	Hook came broken in half, had to glue back together
2	I took my camera on a 2 week trip to Thailand, I only carry it on my pocket or bag, and the lens got scratched really bad, it worked well uder water, I do not recomment it, had I know how fragile this camera is I would have bought one of its cheaper competitors
2	The colored sticky tabs you’re supposed to use for quick reference were all stuck to the paper- every single one of them and the front cover was all bent. I was not too pleased but it could have been worse I guess. Luckily the other two codes books were okay except on one the spiral bound part at the top was coming apart.
2	The color never faded or changed like it's supposed to, even when directions are followed closely
2	Cute, wears well but very thin material. See through as well. Dress ripped after one time wearing it.
2	It's lightweight, but a little larger in diameter than I expected. Doesn't work well in my water bottle holder on my bike, which is why I bought it. Return shipping was half the cost of the bottle, so it wasn't worth returning. There are better options available. Keep looking.
2	I don't even use these anymore. They are too dim for use
2	Just got this delivered Friday, pulled it out of the undamaged box...product had big dents in top and bottom, and the grate was bent out. Just asked for a replacement. I'll update my review once I've received the next one.
2	I liked the design and form factor. For this size and what it was supposed to be capable of, I though it was a deal. But IT DOESNT FAST CHARGE. The main reason I bought this one over similar products was for the fast charge capability, so naturally I'm dissatisfied. I guess I got a dud. Which is common for Chinese manufacturers. Not happy but it still works...just not well.
2	These were cute but run very easily.
2	Broke. Literally snapped out of my hand and broke. So sad. I really loved this one.
2	I didn't like the cleaning process. Also, the smell of the plastics in all my food. Was disgusting no matter what did I cook.
2	I used about 30-40 pumps of this and it made some small bubbles (not "proper" bubbles but more like the tiny ones you get when you use soap or shampoo in the bath) after a couple of minutes all of the bubbles had completely disappeared. I've given two stars as the scent was nice. Perhaps it's better for babies who have extremely short baths?
2	I bought two of these. One broke after the first use. I would not purchase from this company again.
2	The app would be 5 stars but for the ability to watch shows in Spanish. I'm trying to teach my toddler Spanish and several kid shows are available in Spanish, provided you're able to enable it. Done some research and seems no one had thought of this, which is disappointing.
2	Lesson learned because I was honestly expecting a comparable product to similar products on the market. I've purchased 10 other similar shelves and this is by far the lowest quality (lighter gauge metal, weak casters, vertical shelving rows without cross bracing versus the usual horizontal base on the shelves). If you like quality products made with quality materials I would not recommend saving a few bucks. Gave it a star because it could work in a very low performing area like a closet for someone else. So in the end, depends on what you plan on using it for.
2	The bracelet broke the third time I wore it.
2	With all of the choices to choose from, what I didn't want was a loud fan motor. This is not the one. This fan motor is so loud, I can hear it outside of the building it is in. LOUD! Unsatisfactory. Too late to exchange. A big fat dirty diaper of disappointment. Lame, weak, loud, heavy, loud, fan motor.
2	Nice cut...nice style...skimped on material quality.
2	I ordered two boxes and both boxes had damaged ink cartridges with ink is leaking and spilling out. So basically, two cartridges were no good. The undamaged ink seems to be ok though.
2	The product itself looks really good. The problem is that it makes the case itself so slippery to hold onto. It falls out of my pockets so much. I’m thankful my phone hasn’t been broken.
2	The boys had a great time laughing like a pack of hyenas for about 10 minutes - that's how long it took for them to come apart. They tried & so did I to get them back together but couldn't do it.
2	not that great quality
2	This new med does not work as well as regular Sudafed . My doctor suggested to try this, but it's not as effective
2	Love the tapestry but the hem lines are completely irregular.
2	Im still unsure. This package came in a bc destroyed box and the socks look le they've been worn. There's even some hairs on them. Ummm....
2	Going back to my scrubbing bubbles and brush, just awkward for cleaning the tub and sinks for my large hands.
2	Shipping was horrible. This box was shipped in a bubble envelope and was absolutely smashed. What were they thinking?
2	Poor quality, two cases arrived broken. We'll see how long the others last.
2	This bag is cute and the color is great. My problem is that it is heavy and the lining is weird. It feels like plastic paper and the zippers are very cheap. I carried it once and promptly changed back to my old purse.
2	One of the lavalier wireless microphones did not work, and the other that was working dropped out constantly. And as a result the product was returned to Amazon.
2	When we plunged the set it did not work. Had to send it back
2	It is not a good product. Some spices took time to grind. For example, Cummins took a lot of time at least 20 minutes to grind well.
2	I always wear a medium so I got a large. The fit was fine but it looked nothing like the picture. The back was not as long as pictured and the “black” was more of a dark gray. It was also extremely see through. I returned it immediately.
2	I will have to give this a 2 stars only because I expected it to be better. I usually don't care to write reviews but when it comes down to durability this stroller is not good. Second day of using the stroller it the wheels won't turn smoothly or correctly. It is hard to push around corners. Im thinking of oiling the wheels. The cup hold is very cheaply made. Other than those two things I like the shade it gives my daughter.
2	It’s a good bottle but with a toddler that is teething. The nipple won’t last. He has gone through three nipples. Leaks everywhere.
2	I’ve been wearing Clark’s 9M for over 20 years and they always fit perfectly. Unfortunately the last 2 pairs of Clark’s that I have ordered have been at least a half size too large. Either my foot has shrunk, or Clark’s has changed their sizing. This is a cute style, unfortunately these shoes won’t work for me.
2	I bought these erasers for my classroom and have decided not to use them. They smear your board rather than erase.
2	Only dislike is the part you put your neck on it. That bother the neck
2	Very pretty, but discolored my outdoor columns. I purchased this product because you could use it Outdoors.
2	Too bulky to wear under work out clothes. Kinda defeats the purpose.
2	Very easy to install. Although its about an eight inch too small on each side. I have a galaxy j7 crown
2	So granted I have a 1 year old bluetick, 9 month boxer and 6 month german sheppard....might just be their puppy stage but this product did nothing to calm them down....wasnt expecting a drastic change but something would have been better than nothing. They do however enjoy the treats for all thats worth.
2	The tie knot makes the shirt fit loose.
2	I purchased 2, 1 works great and the other not so much... it doesn’t put out even pressure and is much louder thatn the other.
2	It makes for a decent topper when it’s cool/cold. However, come spring or summer and this mattress topper makes you sweat uncomfortably. Disappointed because this was my main purpose in purchasing a topper. Having spent a lot of cash, I’m now having to spend more money buying the same product of a different brand!
2	Excellent variety of plants. However, arrived dead to my home. I live in Minnesota and they were probably out for delivery all day (frozen). I was comforted to read in the literature that accompanied them that an occasion freeze would revive them. Not so this time. Have soaked, had in indirect light, and cared for as directed for two weeks and am down to two of eleven that have not rotted apart.
2	Run super small. 6 to 9 months can probably fit a newborn
2	The staps where it clips to the head rests loosens on its own. I've had to adjust it several times because when it's not tight, it moves around.
2	Didn’t work well not a high quality product
2	I think this bathing suit was made for a size 3 person. I ordered an extra large thinking OK this will fit , no way it did not fit
2	When recd, the pkg was ripped open, box smashed & 2 jerkys were open. Very sad si ce it was a fathers day gift i can not give now :( The o es we could eat tasted good tho.
2	Unfortunately it did not work on our tower inflatable paddle board so we had to send it back.
2	Not a very good product. Doesn't play DVDs cleanly.
2	I felt that this would be a good purchase. I received the product in good condition and did the intial wash in my dishwasher on the top rack with my other baby items. The tray came out warped. I tried to bend it back but was not successful. I am going to try and return but I just wanted to inform people to beware of cleaning in the dishwasher. Even it top rack it is not safe.
2	I was hoping for more pockets for SD card and a better fit for a hard drive.
2	art doesn’t go with covers. Art is all blurry . You can tell these are not original. Low quaility on picture . I Should of read reviews before buying .
2	Not comfortable. I’ve been wearing them all day and my calves are hurting. They’re hard. No cushion.
2	Holy cow, this hat is small. And deep! I normally wear kids size hats on my small head and this one was tight. Also, the depth of the hat is weirdly large. If you pull it down even remotely close to having the top near your head, it's down past your eyes. Really weird fit. Sent it back.
2	Definitely disappointed in the spring form pan the coating came off after first use. The rest is good
2	not as clear as advertised for night driving for me.
2	I really wanted to like this hat but the bill is very long and though description says unisex, it is not very flattering on a woman (in my opinion).
2	A couple of them came broken and don’t stay on my knuckles unless I bend my hand like the picture
2	The case is attractive and seems to offer good protection, but is NOT charger friendly. I have probably a dozen different cords and none of them are able to function effectively with this case on. And I'm not going to take the whole thing on and off each time I want to plug my phone in, so this purchase was basically useless to me.
2	Love the concept so much! However, they do not stick well
2	I would give a higher rating, but when a product shows up with missing pieces(missing hand pad) it kinda puts a damper on everything else that went right. Shipping was quick, they fit & were good quality... but like I said, missing pieces.
2	Loved how they fit. I ordered green and a pattern. The green were a perfect fit and pattern were really big. After washing I couldn't wear the green. The others still fit. Both shrunk in length and width. Expect probably 10 to 20% shrinkage.
2	The hat came ripped. I did not notice the seam unsewn until after my nephew opened it. I sewed it right there. The gives are.no more than dollar store gloves. Although, he loves them.
2	Used product for months and did not see anything improvement
2	The dress would have been great but the reviews stated to order a size up that it ran small, it runs large. Also, the ruffles on the arm are attached sleeves.
2	The string to tighten the cover ripped out of part of the cover the first time it was used. Now the cover slips off in high winds. In normal weather it works.
2	I ordered two Charles Rivers jackets received them fast but both was to small.I sent them both back in same package and have only got credit for one. Don't know what problem is.
2	After using it to cultivate some of the backyard 6 of the spikes broke off. Spend the extra money to get a power tiller if you plan on working on hard soil
2	I caught a mouse, but it was really late at night so I was going to wait until morning to release it. However when I woke up in the morning, I found that the mouse had chewed it's way out.
2	I love the look but it falls off the watch constantly.
2	Every one broke in the area to place the cord. However, they still work by simply clamping the cord against shirt.
2	The neck is not stretchable. The XS could not fit over my 5-pound chihuahua's head.
2	Ordered and it never showed up. Was told they could not replace the shipment but received a refund from Amazon
2	It's a beautiful box but after three months, it's coming apart. I'm very disappointed.
2	These arrived leaking and broken. I understand that it’s creamer getting shipped through the mail however I’d like more bubble wrap or some other type of packaging contents.
2	This shirt kind of breaks my heart. I love it so much, the birds are so cute, the fabric is nice and light, but it has no give and truly does run far, far too small. This shirt would have fit me alright, except my chest is far too large for it. As soon as I put it on it squashed my boobs right down, but hung loose on my waist. I opened up the page to initiate a return on it, as I couldn’t go any larger in size on this product, and this seller does not accept returns. I genuinely was so excited for this shirt and now to wear it I would have to allow my breasts to be squished to oblivion. On someone with a smaller chest and less violently curved proportions, this shirt would be lovely.
2	Typical Chinese, build quality is sub standard, way overpriced
2	Don"t like the fact that the cover chipped and it doesn't work now, not buying it every again, its a leave of crap, cover gets chipped can't be used anymore, dissapointed
2	Very misleading, not virgin hair. The hair is reddish. Feels like beauty supply store hair. Hair was true to length bundles were thin though. Will not buy again.
2	Very attractive and comfortable in sandals. However, the socks cut across the tops of the toes and were very uncomfortable in closed toe shoes or boots. I would like the same degree of support with enclosed toes. . However,the socks cut across the toes and were very uncomfortable in closed toe shoes and boots.
2	Fit was tighter than expected.
2	The screw that is supposed to connect the two pieces together isn't long enough. It still works, but the two pieces can't be connected with the provided screw. Disappointed.
2	I like this smart plug but what I really don’t like is that they sent me used one while I ordered the brand new one. Since I don’t have a time to request for replacement I just write it here. I can even ask for the refund cuz it’s about trusting issue... well, it’s working well but I don’t like that fact that it’s not new... Don’t do it again. I give 2 stars since it’s not new.
2	It is huge and the bill is grey. Did not receive what was pictured.
2	I didn't realize that I have to continually recharge the headphone battery. Why doesn't it recharge as it's being used?
2	I didn’t realize how much vulgar language there was in it. I had to send it back because it was just too much F word and other words that were in appropriate
2	After a few weeks the mic stopped working.
2	The pancake batter gets all gunked up when trying to mix. Cleaning is at best hard. If you do buy this inferior product; please make your batter mix thinner than usual Also forget about adding blueberries to your mix. It will get stuck in the nozzle. Add your blueberries to the batter already cooking This maybe the worst item I’ve bought on amazon, and I’ve bought hundreds
2	The case is nice and clear, no scratches or stains yet, but the bottom cover does not fit correctly. It doesn't lock into place like the top cover does, so it almost slides off whenever I grab my laptop. The cover comes up enough to secure one side, but the two shorter sides are not secured at all. I'll probably have to buy a different case. The keyboard cover is fine (not completely clear--more like frosted). The case is not matte but smooth plastic, so if you're looking for a matte case don't get this one.
2	Since the headrests don’t come off in my car I couldn’t use these. Bummed too because the return shipping is not free! The material seemed nice, but I’ll never know how well they would have worked since the design is pretty silly with having to completely remove the heat rest to install.
2	Loved the Jeep but the steering control broke really quick. I emailed the vendor a few weeks ago and still haven’t heard anything back.
2	I wanted to love this. But it's incredibly light weight and has some weird lumps in it when I make my bed. Like it doesn't lay correctly out flat.
2	I love the sleek look of this case, but I didn't at all feel like my phone would be protected if I dropped it. The edges bent down pretty easily as well. If you aren't an accident prone sort of person and never drop your phone, this is a great and beautiful case! Otherwise, meh
2	I had high expectations for this item but unfortunately I’ll be returning it! Looks and feels cheap! I’m afraid of putting items because I don’t want it ripping apart. I guess I’ll have to keep searching for the right one for me..
2	burnt the first time we used it. maybe we did something wrong. we had to throw it out it smelt like burnt popcorn even after I tried to clean it.
2	It was overwhelmingly obvious what was going to happen at every point in this movie.
2	It says it's a full once with a zipper to reseal the package. What I got in the mail is a small paper packet that says half an once and has nothing to seal the packet back up after opening.
2	Like the gloves, comfortable, but I had to return due to a hole in a finger.
2	it was great for about 3 days until the mag stop wore down and now doesnt stay back when the clip is finished so you end up wasting a ton of air especially in full auto when this happens. Accuracy sucks even in single action. The sights are also off but I couldn't get a grouping for my life. My daisy powerline pistol is 30x more accurate but doesnt feel as real as this. Its a real shame Umarex doesnt recall these or answer you other than saying theres nothing we can do.
2	Smelt like straight up hot glue and was missing a chuck of the fake leaves
2	I have bought these from another seller and they worked great! These not so much
2	I like the dark gray color and overall look of the sheepskin. This seems well made, but unfortunately gets too hot for me and within minutes. I ended up flipping it back and forth to get a 'cooler' side for the duration of the ride, eventually giving up and removing it. And it wasn't even warm/sunny. The search continues.
2	Product seems nice and sturdy, good design but doesn’t actually work, no matter which way attached to the light bar, the bar you are attaching it will won’t have any clearance.
2	sloppy fit on SBC crank snout, standar size. It is aluminum as the description says. I recommend finding a steel socket if you are going to use something like this very much.
2	I have tried to watch this animated movie twice. I just can't get past the stylized animation that I do not care for. This showed up on Amazon Prime, so I thought I would give it a try again, but without success. It seems that others are not put off by the primitive style animation.
2	For some reason the flavor really brought me to the holidays and Christmas time in the winter really good flavor but the coloring is bright green and it’s very grainy Textured I am really not a fan but maybe a holiday treat
2	Cheap material used around seams. Black color started coming off. Had to use black permanent marker to cover up color showing through. 😠
2	Ordered & received 3 bottles. One for each Harley saddlebag and one for the garage. The spray nozzle operation became intermittent on 2. Real pain to get dependable spray. Final straw. During 6 day California ride spray quit completely. Ended unscrewing nozzle and flipping fluid with pickup straw onto the windscreen. Only one bottle sprayer still works. Going to Walmart see if I can find smaller compact spray bottle to fit in the Harley saddlebags
2	Heres the thing the vanity was completely torched upon arrival. Just in shambles, legs cracked off, Panels cracked in half, broken top, bad. The company did the right thing and refunded the purchase in full.
2	Worked like a charm till it did. Of the three fans, one stopped working and another spins very slowly. Lasted a good 7months. Expected a window fan to at least be rated for and last a whole year.
2	The bag looks good but it's kinda flimsy and unable to stand on it's own. The top opening sleeve and lack of a luggage strap makes it hard to travel with. And it scratches really easily. Barely had it for a week and it looks like I have been using it for years. I also found it to be heavier than other similar bags I have held (colleagues have them). Overall, not quite the long term bag I was hoping it would be.
2	Turn table works great but the mint green color I ordered is absolutely not what I received. The color is robin egg blue which is very disappointing.
2	Not very entertaining
2	If you buy this, immediately cut off the straps (see photo) that are designed to go between the seat and back. Our husky got under the cover and got his head stuck in the strap and started choking. They are too small and a danger to the dog. I cut them off.
2	It was OK but wouldn't purchase again.
2	They would be really nice if they lasted but I'm already down one of them and haven't used them very much yet
2	The pink pillow sham as pictured online is quite different from the orangey-pink color shams i received.
2	Beautiful Scale.. Exactly what I was looking for... Update: The scale is inaccurate.. Close to 6 to 7 pounds off.. I went on two separate scales and they were the same.. I guess I have to subtract the difference..
2	purchased to hang art at a festival, grid is a nice quality piece but came in a box that was so terribly ripped and had many holes, the butterfly clamps fell out i’m guessing because it only had one clamp. extremely disappointed. will have to try to make work with zip ties. other than that, nice quality.
2	The rear holes didn't match up properly with the Samsung Galaxy J7
2	I’ll give two stars because they aren’t toys. It’s nice to find the key but they sound bad. A lot of bad holes and feels flimsy. I’m comparing to Marine Bands so for a beginner or just a hobby player these would probably be great. But not really for a show or recording.
2	The Bobby pins work well, but the case is hard to slide
2	Barely works. Very finnicky to actually get it to charge.
2	Didn't like kind of greasy.
2	The bottom cracked soon after I put it on my laptop. The case barely stays on and it definitively doesn’t protect my laptop. The case is inexpensive but still isn’t worth the price
2	Nice quality kraft paper cards with a rustic look... but the cards are a very tight fit in the envelopes. Major bummer. Would definitely NOT recommend.
2	It worked for about a day then broke.
2	It’s okay. Bought two, one for myself and husband. I don’t care for it because the material it is made from is hot.
2	They were much thicker than the original insole and with them removed did not fit well in the shoes even after cut to size. He tried anyway and the fabric came off in the first day. We ended up giving up and just got him new shoes. The insoles were for kids adidas.
2	I'm a woman Marine and this collar device is NOT for your lapel on blouses or uniforms. I know, I use to wear the lapel pin. Notice this says collar device. One of the male customers on Amazon gave feedback and called it a nut and bolt and he is exactly right i thought he was just joking when I read his review. He was not joking at all. This little device has a little bolt and you screw the back on. It will not even leave a tiny hole in your garment, it will damage your garment and leave a large hole in it. I telephone the company and told them that it is regulation size and the eagle globe and anchor look really good,but the back of this device is not for a collar. Do yourself a favor as I will do, go to an Army surplus store in your area and all the branches are there. The lady that I spoke to at this company didn't really give a rip. So, don't waste your money or time to return to Amazon, which I did without any problems from Amazon, and I got my money back.
2	Advertised as durable, anti-scratch, etc....and of course they have the 3M name, and are therefore more expensive than most others. These scratched faster and easier than any pair of safety glasses I have ever owned. Not again.....I will stick to the cheap, durable ones.
2	Not really 12' x 12'. Used it under my 12' x 12' dance floor and it was a foot short on both sides.
2	When the hell did they reverse the order of the pieces? 1 used to be the best now 10 is?? I'm still not used to it!!
2	The item worked great for 3 uses but then one of the support arches come out of its holder so we had to glue it back in place. Then the next time, a spring broke in the device that keeps the umbrella open so now it doesn’t work after only a few uses. It also can’t be returned because it’s been too long.
2	We love this new slip-to-grip gray doormat. We put it across our front porch between the front steps and the door. It looks very nice. Unfortunately, due to its being rolled for packing and shipping, the surface is uneven. Different sections are at different heights. We both have balance issues, so we trip on the highs and lows of the mat. We love the color and texture, but it is too dangerous for us. We had to stop using it after two days.
2	Hoped to have this app provide convenience but might as well just load the website through amazon internet.
2	When we received this charger, it didn’t look like the picture, however it worked fine so we didn’t return it. 4 months later, and it stopped working completely.
2	Item came in excellent packaging and in a timely manner. The reason for the 2 stars is because it contains high fructose corn syrup and it was purchased for my disabled husband and he can't eat food with this ingredient and I wouldn't have purchased if known otherwise.
2	I was disappointed with the product because it kept coming out of my ears. The cord was also uncomfortable. Unfortunately, I had to return and search for a more suitable pair.
2	I've been using sage for years. Thought I would try this combination of products. The Sage is good, but the smudge sticks are just piece of wood with a little aroma ... not worth the money.
2	I have dry hair and it just made it drier. Maybe, it just wasn't for me.
2	I tend to like dark novels, but I didn’t like this one. I found it a bit on the slow side and had to make myself finish it.
2	They were great while they lasted. The needle broke off one of them after only the third time wearing them
2	I received my package today. Service was fast. I paid for two orders. One order was nice and dry and the other was wet and smelly. I was not happy about the wet package as this product is to be used to create gifts for an upcoming function.
2	Very small and not expandable - Flimsy material. I travel weekly and was looking for a small bag for a couple day trip. This bag is very cheaply made (although not so cheap in price). I would spend a bit more and get name brand luggage.
2	I ordered this used and the dvd was of a concert, not the one guaranteed to come with it. ): I couldn’t do my project for school and didn’t find out until too late to return the item.
2	No photos, typo on the back page. I started to read through and found the prep instructions hard to follow because they are a giant run on paragraph. Some of the recipes sound pretty, good wish the layout was more readable this looks like a high school kid made it.
2	I love the look of this and it’s so cute but it falls off often and I don’t notice and then I am having to look around and find it because it has fallen off. I wish it would lock around the bands or something so it didn’t fall off
2	I really love the color and how light and stretchy the band is, however, this frame is too big and will not fit the Blaze. Comparing it to my other frames, it looks like its the same size, but my Blaze just falls right thru it, and there is no way it would ever clip to the frame.. Waste of time and money.....
2	I have to turned always up the brightness to see it
2	I gave this as a gift to a loved one. Within a couple of months, the waist pouch clasp broke. The product says there is a lifetime guarantee, but there does not seem to be a way to get in touch with the seller. My friend says the whole set up is great, but the fact that the clasp broke so soon is a big bummer.
2	I bought these for broccoli sprouts. Sure, they work well with jars, but they won't last long if the first batch of sprouts caused the mesh to rust. The quest for a quality non-plastic sprouting solution continues...
2	I bought this thinking that it would teach me how to write calligraphy, but it's mostly blank pages for you to write calligraphy on your own over and over again.
2	None of my lids match up. They look so cheap sitting there with a crooked lid, which also causes them to slightly leak. I wouldn't order again.
2	Reservoir does not hold soap at all not enough for a 1/4 of a car.
2	This table is not worth the price. It was entirely too small. In the picture, the table looks much bigger to me.
2	My son hates it. Played it 3x and now its in the game grave. Im old school...Played Sonic on the Original Sega. This game has a strange overhead view and nothing like most Sonic games. Graphics are a bit lame and there simply is a reason why its only 39.99
2	Wear down very quickly
2	My girlfriend got for us each a lunchbox, same product just different colors. However, when i opened it, mine only comes with a spoon and the spoon is just a random spoon that they just threw it in and packed it. Its made in China i mean... just... have to be ready for some kind of shit right?
2	These were not stained like the picture. And they don't turn. I have them on the bottom of a light wooden box and it wont roll. Would not recommend
2	Two times we had a problem with break and stability of this stroller is not good.
2	I was disappointed about the size of these. I thought they were bigger than they are.
2	Very flimsy. Ice cube facets aren't nearly as sharp as pictures suggest.
2	Love these pots, but they have a short life span. Both Breville's have lasted about one year and they always break at the handle where it connects to the carafe. The carafe's are not replaceable, so for $200 you would expect them to have a better quality. It's too bad, because I really like the unit, but after replacing it twice for the same issue, I will have to look at a different brand.
2	I absolutely love this product. It really works to get rid of warts fast. However, I have always had serious problems with the tube it comes in.. Every time I use it, it does not seal properly, and the gel leaks out and gets wasted. I have had to buy this product 4 times because I can hardly use it since it keeps leaking.. And when I go to use it the tube is all blocked because the gel has hardened. I really wish this would come in some kind of different tube or something.. I have had this problem every time I have bought this and I'm sick of buying it! Unless I am using it wrong, I really wish the manufacturer would do something about this.
2	The case itself seems fine, but it doesn’t work well with my phone so I need to return it. There was no return label included or option for exchange. This is really frustrating and will mean that I will choose a different product.
2	I like the idea but it’s to big it should have a longer Velcro
2	I had a great deal of difficulty understanding the words. I needed sub-titles.
2	This recorder does not pick up voices in a room unless your mouth is right near it. Only good for maybe notes to yourself , but a cell phone can do that.
2	Cheap Chinese garbage. No holes for wires so be prepared to drill those out. Compared to the si wing I currently have on my car (replacing because leak) the dimensions are similar but definitely different enough to be noticable... If this doesn't mount to the factory holes when it finally stops raining enough to do the work, the review is dropping to 1 star and will be contacting for return.
2	Arrived missing pieces. The canopy ripped as soon as we placed it over the frame (which we make shifted since pieces were missing) only gave 2 stars because I imagine this greenhouse would be moderate if it came with everything and didn't rip before it was even put together.
2	Crunchy, fresh, but not really for me. I only like 2 of the flavors, but they were a little too strange for me. I'm too used to american flavored treats to like these flavors. But I do have to say that the chicken bbq one ACTUALLY tastes like chicken. It's crazy real. But if you like different unique flavor, you'll probably like this.
2	I don't want to sound rude... but if I can print in color, WHY CAN'T THEY? If your going to publish a fine book like this, can't you spend the extra $$ to make something PROUD of?
2	I got this amp a few months ago and loved it for about a month. The audio keeps going in and out. I am moving now and have decided to just trash it. Terrible amp. Get a better quality amp for more money.
2	Smells good. Doesn't remove makeup. Also doesn't lather.
2	I am 5'9", wear a size 14, have a large bust, and long arms and legs. The XL fit surprisingly well in the shoulders and bust, but was a bit loose in the rest of the torso. Probably could have gone with a L. The arms were too long, especially when wet. I could pull it down almost to my knees, so works well if you want more of a tunic or dress than a shirt in terms of coverage. I wore it one time with no problem, rinsed in cold water after my swim, and hung to dry. It definitely worked to protect from the sun. The next time I went to put it on, the left side seam came apart in two places, and continued to unravel throughout the day. I ordered it in preparation for summer so too late to return. Sad I paid so much for a defective product.
2	It’s cute and sturdy but the horizontal strip part that you attach to the wall is crooked on mine! It bothers me every time I look at it.
2	This is tasty, but clumps badly and won't pour from shaker despite careful storage. I even added edible anti-caking powder and stored it airtight with packaged desiccant. Still clumps badly every time, so is unusable without pounding out the clumps. Does it need the neon artificial color?
2	I love this dress but one of the pockets wasn’t sewn all the way around
2	I am not sure if my dock may just be defective or what, but the HDMI port isn't sending feed to my HDMI cable. My cable works with all my other electronics, so I know that is not the issue. However, whenever my switch is docked in this device, the little blue light illuminates but my monitor is not receiving any signal from it. It sucks because this was the primary reason I bought this dock in the first place. It does charge the switch very well, but other than that it doesn't work for it's primary purpose.
2	This dress is so pretty and the material is great. The problem is that the arms are very small and the dress overall is smaller than I expected. I need to return it but just haven't yet.
2	Too sharp which can cur your fingers too
2	Didn’t work for our dog.
2	VERY small. The sizing is very off and barely went over my wrists.
2	I wouldn't call this four-season at all. It's not very comfortable for more than 1 person and sleeping on the ground is never a good adventure under any weather. The windows are backwards. The screen can only be operated from the outside - which is a really dumb design. Also it is difficult to open the front "porch" door from the inside, even after I added parachute cords to the zipper to make that easier. The pole holders/chutes were functional but the fabric tore really easily. The stakes provided were functional but not capable of handling any sort of rough terrain and force when hammering - three were irreparably damaged when setting up camp. Lastly the tent had poor assembly instructions. The half-sheet that was provided wasn't very clear on what was what - I had to completely unpack the tent to find the inner half and that they were supposed to hoop through - I was building the tent upside down for the first ten minutes!
2	I bought this for my grandson for Christmas and after riding it a few times the lock bar broke and he was so upset. Too late to return since I bought it in August for Christmas.
2	Does not allow keyboard backlight to show. Wished I would have known before I bought, never would have got this cover.
2	I could not deal with the strong odor. It made me cough and my eyes watered. It was effective against bug bites but would not buy it again.
2	I bought this less than a year ago, and I've been having consistent problems. So I will preface that this computer was barely USED by me until 3 months ago, and I've had nothing but problems since. There was no physical damage as far as I could tell however I've been having problems since I've decided to use it regularly: The wifi is very unstable and sometimes nonexistent, since I had to move from my laptop to using this desktop, I've been attempting to play games with my friends, only to disconnect every 30 minutes. Now I originally thought the issue was my internet provider, but none of my other devices were having issues. I decided to investigate my router, no issues at all. I move to the pc and I noticed that the usb dongle they include that either assists (or allows not even certain at this point anymore) the wifi connectivity was no longer operating. I removed it, and plugged it into my old laptop, it functioned, I attempted to use it on a different port, nothing. I decided to swap the usb with one that I knew was working, and it didn't work, AND afterwards that port ceased to function until next restart. THIS WAS ONLY WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF ACTUAL USAGE. (Computer was left untouched for most of a year and picked up for primary usage in May). I've been having this problem quite consistently with the ports, and I recently attempted to contact skytech support, of which all of their lines were busy and they had me leave my name and phone number and they'd get back to me as soon as possible. I called at 11 am PST (of which they are open until 5pm PST) and I didn't receive a call since. Now while this problem is quite recent, I would like to point out that this PC is not HTC VIVE compatible due to the fact that there is a significant lack of ports that actually function, some of the ports are not connected to the card which means they will NOT function whatsoever, so if you are using this computer for VR, your only option really is to get a RIFT S for it.
2	Feels great but my own opinion not as protective as i like ,2 star is my own opinion
2	The picture indicated some kind of glittery effect. Really it was just printed plastic with a mottled mustard pattern. Very unflattering. It was also an awkward size, too long for a regular table, too small for 2 tables put together. The front drop was good.
2	These are so difficult to clean. I ended up using most of them only once and tossing them because I didn’t trust that they were coming clean. The cover is also tricky to get on/off.
2	Not the same quality as a previous purchase. Not UL rated and no indication the metal is brass instead of aluminum. The screw fitting is not as deep or tight. Product cheapened by a lot. Can no longer recommend.
2	I’m giving 2 stars because of the lack of support I received from the seller. I emailed them 3 times through here and the email address in the owners manual. The lights did not install very easily and they don’t fit the same way on each socket. The headlights are the same brightness in low or high beam. The manual said to contact them for a “kit” that they would send out for that issue. Never got a reply from any of my emails sent to the email address in the manual, or to the seller. All emails were not responded to. I do like how much brighter that they are than the halogens, but not being able to use the brights. I’m not impressed with either the seller or manufacturer.
2	This mixer has very little power. Tried it on mashed potatoes and it struggled.
2	I have 3 kids and have always liked Huggies best and I still use a different type of Huggies. These ones in particular leaked every single time by son had a poopy diaper where before I never had any issues. Won't buy this type again.
2	Everything work's fine but, the volume its too low, it doesn't use the 50% of the cars volume. I won't event use it, don't like it and don't recommend anyone to buy it.
2	I don't really get a more straight cut with these scissors. The laser doesn't help me, and just makes the scissors bulky. The blade cuts well, but the laser isn't as great as I thought it would be. Would not buy again.
2	I usually wash my car every week and I like my tires to look shiny. After applying the Shine Spray, (and letting it air dry) the shininess only last 3-4 days.
2	It was good but it stopped working. Only the volume button and G-buttons work now.
2	The Cheetos taste fine. My kids like the puffs better than the regular Cheetos. But instead of 104 packs stated in the description, I only got 88 packs in the box. Expire Dec 05 when they shipped them out at Nov 21.
2	Not a fan. The center attachment between toes stretches out. They are ok for a short time.
2	The basic tool is OK. What's not described in your advertisement is the tips. Hex wrenches usually have a rounded tip so they can be used at an angle. and fit deep into the screw head for a good grip. These had a flat tip, which would not grip the screw sufficient to turn. Also, the dimensions listed is the diameter of the shaft and not the dimension of the screw with which it is to be used. I was looking for Tee wrenches that worked with 2mm to 8mm screws. CLR
2	Tastes terrible, didn’t help my nausea at all. Better off with a regular piece of hard candy. Waste of money.
2	Arrived with one knee pad missing a strap
2	Nice looking but does not hold up his jeans
2	not as expected for pix
2	nice case, but not protective at all, my phone fell and camera lens cracked.
2	Don't bother with this "hands free" pumping bra. It doesn't actually hold the flanges in place to make it actually hands free. Also, the cut-outs for the flanges are quite small so unless your nipples hit EXACTLY in the right spot (spoiler alert - mine didn't) then it won't work for you.
2	Very repetitive and didn’t seem worth watching.
2	Avid reader. After so many positive reviews, I decided to try a new author. At first I thought I was tired after a long week! But after 150 pages, put it down. Too many characters. No background information. And long. Perhaps if you read his earlier novels this will make sense but anyone looking to start with this as a new author —- don’t!!!
2	I almost never write reviews, but this vacuum is so misleadingly well reviewed that I had to do it. This is a truly terrible product. I've used mine for approximately 4-5 months, and we're not talking excessively or roughly here, just to vacuum a small room and occasionally an area rug. About six weeks ago, the handle/cannister part started separating from the base while using it normally. It would just pop off and there was no way to secure it. I just had to push them back together and wait for them to pop apart again. Again, I was NOT slamming the vacuum around, the simple action of moving the vacuum back and forth (you know, vacuuming) would cause it to separate. Then yesterday, one corner piece of the base with one of the wheels just fell off while using it. A close look at it showed that one of the cheap plastic locking pieces that kept it in place had moved out of alignment. It is made to do this (lock and unlock). I went to put the corner piece back on and lock it into place. I applied a minimal amount of pressure to relock it and the locking piece snapped. Super high quality stuff here. I tried using heavy duty tape to secure the pieces back together and that worked fine, but now the brush no longer spins. So that's the last straw. This is going in the garbage and I will not be purchasing a Shark product ever again. I would highly recommend you avoid this one. see less
2	For starters allow me to say that the product seems great and feels sturdy enough. I just received the package today and was installing it when I realized there were no keys in the carboard box it came with. It had both sides of the door knob, the middle part as well as the small sheet of metal that goes on the doorframe as well as the screws but there were no keys...I essentially bought this for no reason as I cannot lock it. Again it is a good product, but somehow someone forgot to pack the keys...now I can't lock my room when I go out which was the purpose of buying this in the first place.
2	Shoes looked great, and reviews I read were nice. I thought they were cheap and thin. Not sure if it was just me, but I was led to believe these were almost like athletic shoes for water. (I've previously owned some from Nike that were great). These were cheap and smelled like new plastic. They remind me of something you would find at a dime store. For the price, there has to be something better out there.
2	The machine made great tincture. The machine stared leaking and overheating after 3 uses. Extreamly disappointed.
2	I love the chairs but the shipping with fedex was terrible. first they didn't even deliver them to right address at my work they went to a different office and then they were left outside in the rain, the boxes were wet and the one chair has a small stain.
2	Broken on arrival. Fairy will not turn on at all, I replaced batteries and everything. Looking at the negative reviews, it looks like its been happening to others as well. Never fun to have to take a toy back after giving it to your little one :( Added one star because it looks fun it it would turn on!
2	The moment you start to sweat they unstick
2	While these candles look very nice, they're so irregularly shaped as to be almost useless. Every night is a game of trying to see which candle will fit in which menorah without being so loose that it's going to fall over or so tight that it's going to snap in half while inserting it.
2	Was good for a while but then I began to notice it overheats, don't buy cheap android tv boxes.
2	This did not really work very well and the price is ridiculous. Much better on Amazon, but in general should not have to pay this much for an OTC product.
2	So apparently the handles that attach to the resistance band are held in place by a little rubber ball inside the tube. Unfortunately, the ends of the tube are open. Why aren't they sealed shut? I tried doing one squat, as directed by the provided instruction manual, and the handle broke off and the little rubber ball shot into the floor and almost hit my foot. I'm 6'2" which isn't too freakishly tall imo and squats are in the guide book! This is a dangerous design flaw. 0/10 recommend! It might still work for the other exercises that don't stretch the band as far, such as half rep bicep curls, but I wouldn't risk it unless you like getting shot in the face ;) I'm sending this piece of garbage back asap and getting one of those cheap ones without the handles or the hidden bullets.
2	Bought two. 1 has never worked..the 2nd worked for two weeks
2	I purchased these as a gift and upset that two of the lights are not working. I know they were inexpensive but I still expect them to arrive functioning. The other two that work are very bright and fit perfectly on my bike.
2	Nothing fancy. Bought product due to price. Haven't caught anything yet.
2	Never arrived, but I was refunded. Thank you.
2	It is very difficult to set the alarm. The button seems to stick which makes it difficult to change the time. Also I did not like that the clock did not come with any form of instructions.
2	Didn't have wheels and was hard to move on the floor. Didn't seem to heat as well as others I have. Returned it
2	I purchased this item because it had a high rating, wrong! This device works ok, will only work with one receiving device!! when asking for help you receive no help!
2	love it when i received i and it fit well, but few weeks after swimming a few times a week, it faded almost white.
2	I bought these in mid-February. The right shoe completely failed by late-July. By completely failed, I mean a huge hole had formed under the right heel, straight through the inner and outer soles. My heel was literally in contact with pavement by end of July. The day these arrived, they were generally fine. The only issue I had was a slight discomfort under the right heel. It felt like an imperfection in the inner sole, but it was not enough to stop wearing them. By month 2, the discomfort under the right heel had manifested as a hole in the inner sole. By month 4, the outer sole had worn through on the same spot, and by month 5, I could easily stick two fingers through the right heel and had to stop wearing them. The shoes were otherwise generally very comfortable with the exception of THE GAPING HOLE under the right heel. I really liked the Velcro fastener and the roomy toe-box. I thought I had found a hidden gem of a product -- why would I continue to pay 3X the cost for Merrell Trail Gloves? Oh, now I see. It's because they last 6X as long.
2	nothing spectacular about this
2	Poor quality, plastic sole and almost fell when I first put it on, because of it! Not enough support around the heel. It doesn’t keep your foot flat which is why I need the shoe!!! I have never written a review! I hope this helps in making your decision!!! I am not sure about ordering another one and NO RETURN POLICY!!!!! Which I wasn’t aware of when I ordered it! I am out $20 bucks and VERY disappointed!
2	Not the straight up lemongrass I hoped for much more spice than anticipated. Will keep searching for a substitute.
2	It was tremendously hard to take them out of the box that they came in. The first pair of headphones only lasted me a few days and then I found my old headphones in my sweater pocket XD
2	I bought this because of the price and I got what I paid for. The hands would not attach to the mechanism firmly and in putting the clock into the face was almost impossible as the hands would fall off the end of the spindle every time I got it together. The hands are also very easily bent and if not flattened would interfere with eachother. I will end up having to use superglue to keep the hands on the face, but if I have to buy another, I will find it elsewhere. In the end, it will work and did arrive undamaged, but the frustration with the fragile hands and spindle interface causes more problems than it solves.
2	I ordered an extra large and it was more like a small. Very pretty sure but I definitely will be returning it
2	Is it worth it? Not sure with the price. Making sauerkraut the small pieces can easily float up around the edges of this if using in a canning jar, which kind of defeats the purpose. I ended up figuring out how to make it work using an intact cabbage leaf on top of the chopped cabbage, packed it down and put the weight on top. It works ok with this method.
2	I have been using these types of braces for years for Ms foot drop.. I was excited for a black color. The strap was over a foot long and had to be wrapped around twice and just slid off the back of my leg. Poorly designed.
2	At first I was hooked. But then, the story became slow paced, twisted, farfetched, unbelievable. I really didn't enjoy it.
2	The money clip wears out quick and the top pocket side were you put photo I’d had same brand but too different types of wallets
2	Doesn’t work well at all!
2	Didn't seem like it actually charged the controllers, and the lights on it are way too bright.
2	Very thin stainless. I didn't realize how tiny these were - not the generous soup spoons I'm used to in Thai restaurants that I hoped I was getting. And the edges are sharp, not smooth. I've bought other Zebra stainless products that were phenomenal - durable, thick stainless, smoothly polished. These are more low-quality.
2	These are good pads. We have one I purchased two years ago. This time I ordered two 6x9 rectangular pads and received two 8 foot circular pads. Upon returning them I had one label and used the UPS store which said I would have to buy a $12 box to place them in since I only had one label. I printed two labels but they were the same and UPS said I could only use one of them. So I have Amazon Prime and it cost me $12 dollars for Amazon's mistake.
2	It worked fine for prepared beds but if you get into hard compacted ground it’s does nothing but spin on the hard dirt. It needs a better tip instead of the needle point that’s it has so I’ll throw this in the junk box in my shed
2	Cut and fit were good, BUT the first two times I wore two different pairs, one of each sock didn't make it through the day without a hole where my big toe was. I work in an office and put minimal stress on them, so they're not very sturdy.
2	Very uncomfortable shoulder strap can’t be held for very long
2	The chain on the charm is very smaller than I expected, but the charm is very cute.
2	nice design, but unsturdy and weak needs braces. unpacked to find broken peices of wood in box. will not buy from seller again.
2	As far as accuracy, I’m not sure if this is or not but it quit working twice today and changed my body height and weight by itself and I started a timer for my workout and it didn’t even log it! Sending it back.
2	These fit weird and look weird in person. Ugly shirt, I don’t like wearing them
2	Broke after week of use
2	I don’t know why but my cat refused to eat this food. Yes, he is spoiled, he is finicky, so I didn’t force the issue. I just figured it was him. But - there’s stray that hangs around my backyard; I thought he would appreciate it. No, a couple of bites and he’s gone. I can’t recommend a food that even strays won’t touch.
2	Very light and when the posts are assembled there is a gap. It looks cute from distance
2	some of the items in the package had the packaging open so not sure how safe this is
2	I cannot say what they taste like, I used them as part of gift bags. I will say that the count was off and shy 4 lollipops. If you are depending on the count... Buy more or buy from someone else.
2	Looked nice but didn't work as well as I thought it would
2	i got nauseated each time i tried to drink it
2	I received this item broken and have not received a refund after sending it back over a month ago.
2	Maybe it is me but I do not like carbonated water at all !
2	Used it once hunting and Velcro came off
2	Very Pretty Colors! But; I bought these as I thought they were very pretty and not being crafty I thought they would be a nice touch on the baskets this year. I opened the amazon bag and at first I thought they were the labels. Nope, flat ribbon no instructions not a clue on how to assemble these things. Very disappointed.
2	Did not come with the "permanent" mesh filter.
2	I researched for around half an hour to make sure I was getting a Velcro style tape that I can use for cable management in my home office. I wanted to make sure I got one that would hold very strongly and provide enough material for future applications as well. My only worry was that these would not hold strongly, but they are rock solid. The second I got them out of the bag they shipped in, I had to exert a decent amount of effort to separate them just by the small contact patched they had in shipping. Make no mistake, the effort is a pro, not a con. Unfortunately it is stronger than the adhesive it comes with and after trying on multiple surfaces, I have determined it is not a sufficient adhesive for the strength of the loops. This is unfortunate because it otherwise is a great product. I don't intend to use the remainder of the roll, and unless the seller reaches out to resolve, I'll just consider it a $12 loss and move on to a different cable management solution.
2	So I really needed these batteries for my outdoor camera so as soon as I got the package (aka today), I immediately opened it and I began to follow the instructions. I managed to charge two batteries before the cord refused to work anymore. Mind you, I needed 4 charged batteries in total, I only have two...so basically I can’t use the remaining batteries cause I need a new cord to charge them ... so yes their use is wasted. I’m gonna need a replacement or a refund. Save your money and don’t waste time on this like I did.
2	Supports quick charge, decent length, but one of the two Pack just fell apart on me. Completely unusable now, without taking it apart. Received the chargers two months ago. This was my daily use one, taken everywhere with me.
2	One of the bows plates was broken.
2	They were orange not red.
2	This says it is a 2 pack but I only got 1. Not clear if this was a mistake?
2	This is how I received. Wanted to like it but I think I got a returned/defective item. Now I don’t see any option to connect with the seller to get the issue resolved.
2	The heat/temp for application is different than some iron on vinyls but, this does work for the price. I do feel like this peels MUCH more often after washing. Maybe it was the batch I received?
2	Overall dislike of the shoe.
2	Much thinner than expected.
2	brush stop working after 4 uses
2	The picture quality is far below what a 14mp camera should take. Night photos are very poor as you’d imagine if daytime photos are not good. Once the rains came the cameras started to mess up. They would keep taking photos non stop. When in set up mode the shutter would keep triggering and it appears that the quality is low.
2	So, another review is saying one device at a time, well I dont think its accurate. As soon as I received the product, I plugged in my Acer switch 5 on the usb-c port, and charged really fast. That was great... Right after that I added my Galaxy S8 on the quick charge port and it recognized as fast charging, that was great too! Third step was to add another phone on the USB-A smart port, which I did, and to my surprise the tablet stopped charging...I unplugged the usb-a the tablet started charging again...bottom line the USB-a ports can NOT be used with the usb-c charging port... Bottom line, if you want to buy this charger keep in mind you can only use 2 ports, or the 3 USB-A ports... Buying this for the usb-a ports is not worth the money, buying this for the usb-c and quick charge port, I guess its a good deal, hence the two stars... It also comes with a usb-c to usb-c cable which is great, others in this price and even higher, dont. That being said, you do NOT get what you pay for, as the 3 usb-a ports are unusable and nowhere in the description says this. Specifically it says this " Use it to charge a USB-C and 4 USB-powered devices simultaneously at home or in the office.". I was planning on giving 3 stars just because its worth the 2 ports and the price, but after seeing this on the description I will have to drop it on 2...
2	They stained from soda and smoking the 2nd day and it won't come out of it....
2	Not as great as my mr.coffee I brought from family dollar for 10 dollars. Problems: Top does not always open when pressing the button where you put the coffee in. Takes 10 mins for one cup of coffee No indication when the coffee is finished
2	Well packaged product, and received promptly. They have a good taste, but a very gritty texture. Also, quite expensive for the size of the bar.
2	I have taken vegan DHA for 15 years and never had capsules taste so strongly of algae. I have to hold my nose to swallow these. I've bought this brand in the past with no problems but never this particular type. I would not buy this one again.
2	headphone jack hole not big enough for literally any 1/8" jack.
2	Won’t stay on arm. Not enough weight on other end
2	I had been doing some reading on Vit B 12 and found out Methylcobalamin type is better for you than Cyanocobalamin. I have noticed that my neuropathy to my feet seemed to not improve. I have taken the Methylcobalamin type before, and I think it seemed to help me more. The Methylcobalamin type is a little more expensive, but worth it for me. Otherwise, this product is inexpensive, I had no problem with a bunch of broken tablets as some people had, and the only problem, the covering of the tablets could be a little better, because they had a dusty like appearance on them. They de solve OK after a few minutes.
2	Leaves you chalky white
2	Out of the package I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw; several different light source settings, three different magnifications, and all in a compact case in design. However after multiple uses, I’m highly disappointed in this product it is met none of my expectations as the lights are Fairly ineffective and the higher. Magnification settings are too small to get cleared good visuals. I would not recommend this product to anyone and I was disappointed enough to try and return within 30 days and I was told it is in eligible for return so I wasted money for absolutely worthless product .
2	Interface is vary poor and confusing, app doesn't load video if you don't have a WiFi connection, play back is okay. Will not buy again may return it defiantly will buy a different brand!!!
2	Wasn’t what I was wanting for my red foot tortoises. Makes things too dry
2	today,i switched on my PC and there is a message "An operating system wasnt found." entered in BIOS and there is not anymore identified any SSD. worked around 30-35 hours. i am outside of U.S. so i couldn't get any real support. before there were never problems with Amazon.
2	Board does not erase well!!
2	My phone battery went DOWN while it was on the charger (and fast wireless charging WAS enabled). Samsung Galaxy Note 8
2	This gets warm but it has an auto shut off of 3hrs and no option to shut that off so you gotta turn it on many times in the night.
2	This item shown in the picture is not what I received. Very poor quality and all the items can fit in my hand. this picture is very deceiving. Im disappointed regardless of price it should still look somewhat like what you are advertising
2	Worked great the first few times I have used it. My little guy is 8 weeks old now and both pumps have holes in the bottom like it’s splitting at the seam. It now doesn’t hold any milk. I’ve only used them a total of 10 times..
2	it was very very cute, but tight/small. my biggest issue was the length of the inner dress. it barely covered my hiney. i returned it.
2	These are REALLY cool, they just don't fit well. I buy the same size everywhere, but these fall out. Kinda bummed.
2	This dress was pretty and the size was almost spot on. Only issue is that it came missing sequins. I ordered this dress for a party and having it show up damaged was extremely inconvenient.
2	Have taken these for years, but they have changed them now - taste and smell terrible. They melt, even when in the fridge. Called company and was told I could return them to any Walmart, since the brand is carried there...Walmart refused to honor the return, because they were ordered through Amazon.
2	I like the bracelet very much however it broke after only a couple of weeks.
2	I have loved the previous versions of this. The one I just got has sprayer that works finally but the fragrance doesn’t compare to the original sparkling spruce (?). Too many additional ingredients. Stick to the balsam
2	Says it would stick out it on one afternoon and by morning it had fallen
2	First off, I didn't watch the whole thing. I got bored mid way thru and skipped to about 20 minutes from the end. The pacing is slow and light on action, but does make up for it in character development as well as some stunning scenery. The family mansion is to die for. The plot is filled with clichés about the nerdy high school girl who is bullied and yearns to be popular but is just to damn quirky to fit in including the stupid side kick who is loyal but likewise an outcast. However the thing that bothered me most was the not so subtle occult theme throughout the movie. In the end the girl ends up having essentially the power of a God and she is tasked with saving the planet from the evil scourge of humanity...oh and she's gonna birth the savior as well. I was confused as to whether she was gonna save the planet with her powers or usher in the savior as the prophecy foretold. Whatever, the movie abruptly ends with her declaring she wants to help after resurrecting and healing several friends who had just had an accident. I felt the acting was on par with the budget which wasn't much I'm guessing. Some decent actors who's careers are over and they just don't know it yet lol...There's a whole sequence in there about how evil humans are destroying the planet and global warming and such which was a turn off to me as well. And the mom kinda turns into a brutal dictator mid way thru which makes you want to hate her...but she had reasons I guess. Seriously the location scout for this movie deserves a raise.
2	I have put together many pieces of furniture from different manufacturers and this is one of the worse. It definitely takes two people to assemble it and lots of patience. There were no pre-drilled holes for the screws and that resulted in the finish chipping. The top did not line up properly and we had to use an alternate hole to attach it. The only easy part was attaching the wheels. I would not buy another product from this company. On the Pro side it did fit the items I bought it for. I hope it lasts more than a year.
2	This product page is marked as "Made in USA". That's not true. The label clearly says "made in China". The material used for this item is nearly as thin as that "made in China" label. Rubbermaid is using the reputation built by US workers to sell this inferior product. The label is very difficult to remove. The product plastic wall is so thin I'm afraid to break it if I try to remove the label pieces any further. Sorry to say, I cannot recommend this product.
2	Cheap plastic that will break and leave your very expensive phone somewhere on the ground. You get what you pay for here folks.
2	The battery life isn't that much, you can feel the difference when you first use it.
2	Did not feel it met my expectations
2	The case fit, but is too slippery. I have to through away the screen protector, since it could not be applied properly.
2	We have a select number king split bed. I'm not happy with this bed bridge because it's not very wide. We can't strap our mattresses together because each side is operated individually. The bridge falls into the split in the middle which then doesn't really serve the purpose its supposed to. I guess its better than nothing.
2	The screen was torn we had to tape it didn’t look new
2	While the books arrived in a timely manner and in good condition, the 2 book package costs more than buying the books separately.
2	Way sweeter than I expected and not very spicy.
2	Items didn’t work and took forever to receive a replacement.
2	One of the strainers broke after a couple uses
2	Like the other review said. It is cute, but did not stick!!
2	I normally order a large because I like sweat pants baggy but according to the reviews it said to order a size up if you wanted them baggy so I ordered an extra large which I doubt they were because they fit like a medium. Needless to say it was a wasted purchase.
2	Very short! And I’m only 5’2”. Fabric is awful!!!! The print is cute but I can’t get over the stiff plastic feeling of the fabric. Sent it back.
2	Not made for larger breast’s (I am a D cup but I feel this might also be a challenge for C cups). A notation about possible incompatibility with larger breasts was written in the pamphlet that was included with product. HOWEVER this is a critical point and should be mentioned in product description on Amazon. The adhesion also was not great. The product gave my breasts an odd look. Consequently, I didn’t use it.
2	They are too small. Now I have 2 pkgs and probably won’t use them.
2	There's background music throughout. Such a brain strain for me to tune out the background music in order to focus on the speech signal. Doesn't help that the narrator's accent (fake?) is distracting, too. No, thank you. Like asking for a headache.
2	This CD rack looks amazing in the picture... not so much in person. The wood feels cheap and so does the metal. I guess for $27 it's to be expected, though. But what isn't acceptable is having to force some of the screws in because the drilled holes don't match up. I don't mean they're a little off-center. They just don't match up at all. The top piece and the bottom piece are meant to be screwed together but ot was so hard to get in there to drill a new hole out I had to so it by hand. There's not much space to move and get a grip so the screws ended up going in as much as they could but the two pieces are still relatively loose. There's a gap between the two pieces. I don't recommend this to anyone at all. Only reason I kept it is because I'm not going to be moving it a lot so as long as I don't move it, it'll be fine. I also didn't want to go through the return process and disassembling the rack then trying to make it all fit back in the box the way it came.
2	Ladder came with scratches all down all steps and had black dirty soot all over it. Took me 45 minutes to clean it so I could use it inside my house!!! I know it’s just a ladder but if my ladder gets scratched on it I want to be the one to put them there. I have a 6ft ladder that’s 8 years old in better condition.
2	Just received my cool down today and was surprised to see that the product does not fill the bottle. Is this normal? There was no safety cap, however, I did not notice any spilled product in plastic bag it was enclosed in?????
2	Not anywhere near an appetizing smell. Smells like old socks and burnt oil. Have not noticed any difference in my hair. Do not recommend.
2	These tips were perfectly fine at first, and look very nice on the Apple Pencil, but wore out very quickly. I would honestly just recommend buying the apple specific tips because they last much longer than these ones. In 3 weeks I have gone through both tips, just with normal usage of the pencil.
2	Looks more navy blue than black. Shiny fabric. Just a little odd.
2	No cover to protect phone
2	Watch what you get. The one I received had 500GB on the box but inside was a 250GB with the same serial number.
2	I like Hillary Clinton. The book has some excellent stories. But...it's more along the lines of women fighting for power in the government. In almost a full chapter you can see the pain of losing as personal still. I get it. I just wanted the personal emotions not to show through as much.
2	At first use the protectors disintegrated because of the heat
2	I ordered these for my wife and she says they fall off her feet if she doesn't wear them with socks, and even with socks, they are not very snug and slip off. She wears a size 7 and I ordered a medium. The length is right but they are too wide and don't contour to the foot. I would not order again.
2	I bought the socks and the gloves. I am sorry, but they are not that warm. They certainly do not make either my feet or my fingers toasty, as I had hoped. Back to wool and down for me ...
2	The band is too wide to stay on my head throughout the night. I've stopped using it already simply because I wake up without it anyway. I had the same problem with the Slap.
2	I have low porosity hair type 4b hair. This did not work for me.
2	The battery life was ok. The adjustable function is great but the brightness sucked. I used two on a table for 8 outside and could still barely see
2	Not what I thought I ordered. They advertise the ladybug/turtle and I got the flamingo clear pink one.
2	The packaging was not cool! It was opened when I got it. Also they hard and stale. Ugh. I love bubble gum. I work with kids. I will be buying the cherry gumballs from Connecticut after this order. I will never buy these again.
2	I like the concept of this bag where I can take it out if I have an evening event. But the strap broke as I was getting off the Ride on.
2	The kit was supposed to come with a guide book but didn’t. There are a few styling tools I have no idea how to use.
2	It didn't work for me.
2	Very noisy when moving on it.
2	Don’t know if they are tasty or not. They were delivered super quick BUT the wrong item was shipped. Bummer when you actually pay extra to get them here quickly.
2	There is no way to get to the top mounting holes. I tried unscrewing the plastic Ram head and one of them broke.
2	clouds pool and does not desolve real well you can see a white residue floating on top of water
2	Too small for the bedside.
2	Way too firm and heavy. Not what I was going for at all. But I guess they're not terrible. Just really really hard.
2	Should have bought the adjustable
2	Slim cans fit great, however I’m pretty disappointed. It does not keep drinks cold anymore then a normal coozie. We are big yeti fans, I would definitely buy a yeti slim can coozie over Brumate. You can tell by the weight of the coozie itself it no where near yeti. It’s very light weight.
2	There is a center internal divider that limits how you place your BroadHeads.
2	never arrived my order, i am very disappointed
2	The socks are gorgeous but the edge cuts into your feet and hurts after a few hours. Maybe four smaller feet than size 9 1/2.
2	Good thing it's a 3 pack one string broke as I was putting it on and another broke after a few minutes of playing.
2	Extreme bias. It seems that the main focus of the paper is to discredit President Trump often with views that are either dishonest or only halfway factual. Near complete absence of positive accomplishments adds greatly to the bias. I won’t be renewing the subscription.
2	Product was overpriced....especially when one considers only getting two cubes per freezing. Does not release cubes easily. Would not recommend.
2	No pregnancy yet I took for 2 months
2	The atomic function on the clock didn’t work even after setting it by a window where it showed the strongest signal strength all evening and overnight. When I realized in the morning that it hadn’t synced, I tried looking for a signal manually (a few times, too!), but no luck with that either. These methods had previously worked for another Marathon model (slim jumbo wall clock), when it took around 30 minutes to sync (again, after some manual intervention). I’m in the Bay Area, if it helps. Anyway, after all attempts at automatic and manual syncing failed, I was forced to program the clock manually — the process was a bit tedious, if you ask me. Bought it in the white & gold, and it looks and works fine otherwise — as a regular digital desk clock, I mean, just not as an atomic one. And since it was rather cheap, I won’t complain *too* much. I’m actually glad that it’s not constantly backlit (with a bright light), because why would I want my bedroom bathed in neon orange light all night when I’m trying to sleep?! The screen lights up for a few seconds at the touch of a button (on top), so when I do want to tell the time at night, it’s not that complicated a process at all. The numbers are large enough and easy for me to read. The clarity of the numbers does depend on the viewing angle, as some reviewers have mentioned. The size of the clock is appropriate for a desk/alarm clock, IMO. Haven’t used it as an alarm clock, so have no insight to offer in that regard. So, all said and done, my biggest, and *only* grievance is that its absolute *main*, *featured* functionality, is totally non-functional and useless. Now here’s hoping that in order to get my money’s worth, it at least lasts longer than a year! 🤞🏼
2	I intended to use this product for quick spot treatments. I’m not happy with my overall purchase. The water reservoir doesn’t hold enough water so you’ll have to fill it up a few times for one lousy shirt, not to mention it will be hot from being used so it poses as a burn risk. I don’t recommend this product
2	This watch worked great for the first two weeks then it started resetting itself to factory settings every couple days which was really annoying. Also found it annoying to wait for the time to display after pressing the button. Ended up returning it.
2	Much SMALLER than expected.
2	Strap is funny which makes it hard to put on. Pretty dress but I don't like the fit.
2	These were an awesome idea for my dogs so I can see them outside. But they are not safe. My dogs were able to bite them because they hang so low off the collar and was able to bite it open and swallow the batteries!
2	The fine air bubbles would not come out of the screen. Even after several attempts and trying to use a credit card to smooth out the bubbles.
2	ONE YEAR LATER I'm updating this review and taking the keyboard from five stars down to two. The keyboard has been lightly and infrequently used. I'm experiencing issues with squeaking keys and a spacebar that is nonresponsive if tapped anywhere but dead center. Also, and as others have reported, the batteries leaked inside the keyboard. Just know that durability may be questionable here. ----- As a fan on minimalism, I really appreciate this keyboard. It's beautifully designed, and well built. Key travel is just perfect for me. It pairs very quickly across multiple devices. I'm generally using this with my Note 8 and Samsung Dex.
2	the material is very cheep
2	So tiny I gave it to my 4 year old granddaughter
2	They work alright... set it up next to a good old fashioned apple vinegar trap and the Terro trap caught 2, where the home made one caught 12.
2	they are not sturdy at all, when you open them they don't open straight!
2	Inaccurate information about the straps. My mom suffered with the straps they don't give her what she needs. I go and try to help my mom and in the end I lost money. I was so mad that I threw it away after receiving it because of accuracy information.
2	The towel is a very odd shape. I recommended washing a few times to try soften it up before you use it. Also had a hand towel (or face towel). Travel bag included. Average absorbency. Customer service is poor.
2	Didn’t work well for me
2	I was hoping for a few more items , then I received.
2	Nice tube for someone who is not allergic to the tube material.
2	I was expecting the banners to be bigger. I went to return the item and the seller wanted me to pay for the shipping which was just about the amount of the plate set. I asked them if they would send me a shipping label so I wouldn't come out of pocket and they could have there product back and they refused.
2	it was like watching an edited version of a movie with the scenes all mixed up.
2	Was a bit small but seems well made for price.
2	I dislike the fact that I can’t contact anyone to tell them that I only received one package and not 1 case as I paid for. It would be wonderful to find a channel to remedy this problem.
2	Cheap! You know when you buy something from the dollar store and you can totally tell? This item must've cost $2.50 to make all 4. Crap, do not buy.
2	Have only had these a month and the sewing has already come undone from the toe. They don’t seem like they are real Sperry shoes
2	Was wrong color. Did not use.
2	The glasses are nice, but I was promised a book containing drink recipes, and I never received it.
2	Holes did not line up for the product this was supposedly for. But, hey, I just drilled new ones and now it works fine.
2	Not very great .. case is bulky but that doesn’t mean it’s better . It doesn’t really seem it will protect for long . Did drop phone from a small height and the phone also came completely out . It is a loose fit and will most likely cause your phones screen to break at any moment . The material isn’t great either seems cheaply made . Will look for another case, please do not waste time on this .
2	Very cute earrings, but entirely too heavy. The weighed down my entire ear lobe and were super big. Had to send them back for a refund.
2	For the price that I paid, the shipping was absolutely terrible. My amazon box did not come in damaged, yet there was a huge crease at the bottom of the box? If there were more creases I would have given this 1 star, be thankful that I’m nice enough to give 2 stars for my review.
2	The product was little and with chipped paint
2	These did taste pretty good, unfortunately half of them were dried out due to the packaging being ripped inside the box...I am kind of afraid to order again.
2	I had to return these they were super uncomfortable
2	I guess I should've read more reviews before purchasing this product. It is not at all what I expected, but as I was in a hurry when I bought it, I didn't know exactly what I was getting. Touch responsiveness is good. I haven't had any issues with that. The size is a little disappointing. It barely wraps around the edges of the screen, and cuts off the very edge of the display. Not the end of the world, as it's only about 5-10 pixels, but still noticeable. But the adhesive. I had it pop off of my phone twice within the first 20 minutes of use. That's not good. If I drop my phone, this thing is coming right off. I'm also noticing as I write this review that the edges of the screen protector are not even, or straight, and that it can easily be shifted around just by pushing on the edge of the glass with a credit card or fingernail. Overall, I'd get a single screen protector for the same price, or even a little more. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
2	If your hair is thick and curly, good luck! I had a feeling this was not going to go over well and I was right. It pulled my hair out and left it frizzy/wavy still. This might be good for a girl who already has mostly straight hair... But not for thick curly haired girls.
2	Loved this stuff when we first got it but they changed the formula and now it’s awful. My son used to smell great for days. Now he stinks the next morning. Very disappointed they changed it.
2	Much larger than described for size of pet. Poorly made. Seams with strings and areas not sewn fully. Poses danger to pet.
2	The dress I received does NOT look the photo. The flowers are a ugly grayish-green, not like the photos. Also, there is glitter all over the top and bottom on the dress that is not shown on the pictures. The dress is very poorly made and left old quickly/cheaply put together.
2	This product claims to work with most major brand pacifier but it doesn’t. Annoying
2	So I have only had Otter Boxes to protect phones in the smartphone era. This model might protect the phone but the screen protector has a gap that makes the usability very challenging. Thought that over time it would mold but it failed. Worst Case yet. Seller not responding for refund
2	This are made way to small for the size on the chart! I need to send them all back regretfully otherwise they were really cute
2	A little disappointed with these stamps. They don’t saturate the paper well. I had to add a little water to them to make the character appear
2	I used this for about 3 months before the first zipper broke and now after 6 months of use I can no longer use it because the main zipper has broke.
2	I purchased these in late 2016 and they look terrible after being outdoors. The fittings - like corners etc turned yellow and they do not match the pipe sections. Screws all rusted and have rust stains running down. These are junk.
2	The customer service with this device is very poor. Very short and don't aren't honoring the device warranty. The clip broke off the device and so did the collar clip it self.
2	The shipping was fast but the phone was not in good condition as the seller stated it had scratches and it stated that it didn’t have any scuffs of scratches.
2	I just received this item today. I used it on my computer to see if a mic in a headset would work this this sort of item. It did, but the connector has to jiggled to get the sound to go to both speakers. I moved it to the other computer and the jacks still had to be wiggled around to get them to work. I need this item for upcoming events and if after this week the problem persist or gets worse I will have to return the item ASAP. I really need it, too.
2	Too small but had a feeling it wouldn’t fit
2	Nice heavyweight material. Stays put
2	Was very disappointed by very plasticy feel of the oil because of liquid parafin & a very strong smell (artificial fragrance). They may have the claimed ingredients but addition of these additional stuff makes it unauthentic. I have used other ayurvedic oils that are far more original and natural.
2	I would like to just get in contact with the seller but that doesn't seem to be an option on Amazon. I love the idea of this product and it works really well cleaning the grill. The problem is all the water leaks out. Even though I have the valve closed.
2	The price was good, but the wireless charging stopped working. Have to buy a new one.
2	The golden ticket is nice. Not as shiney as the movie but still a good replica. The wrapper I’m very disappointed in. There are streaks through the print like the printer ran out of ink and just doesn’t look as great as the photo.
2	Went on easily and seems durable. Not touch sensitive. I have to retype things constantly and my last screen protector never had issues with that. If you don't use your phone much, this will work. If you text or type a lot, get something else.
2	returned this as I returned the machine
2	Now I would give it only 1 star as it really does Not keep my hair dry, and I am very unhappy with it
2	The suction cups hold well to the glass however the metal sled is slightly too large to fully insert into my Cobra making it difficult to attach and detach. Because it doesn't fully insert, the detector ends up bouncing more than it should. I may need to file the metal down a little to fit better but needing to modify something to make it work the way it's supposed to makes me unhappy.
2	They did NOT change colors or glow and she's had them on two days.
2	Used 1 of the three for my daughter's graduation party. It worked well - the other two must have a hole in them because they would not hold the air....
2	Does not grind in an even fashion, nor does it catch the peppers with each twist. Sometimes you twist 5-10 times before it catches a pepper for grinding. The ground pepper is very course. Would not recommend this to anyone.
2	Doesn't work very well.
2	Not at all happy with item. Stopped wearing it a week after putting it on.
2	The pins were really sharp. They should file down the pins.
2	Ordered these extra capacity folders sit directly next to other pendaflex file folders I have - so I wanted them to match. However I received Office Depot box bottom folders. I’m sure they’re also made by Pendaflex but they are a different shade of green and the box doesn’t have the printable labels that I’ve received with other Pendaflex folders. Two stars because for most they’ll work, but I take the time to order what I want, and I expect that item to be delivered.
2	Bought this product in the March and my right headlight has gone out now twice. Lights look great but for whatever reason one of the bulbs is faulty.
2	Can not clearly fine reason to purchase these again for any reason.....good concept, but poor quality product. Received these whisks three years ago and we use them once or twice a week. We hand wash these also and no measure of abuse can be identified during their use at home. We find the larger whisk to be too flimsy and smaller ones good enough. However, they all have experienced random loss of the silicon material from around the wires.....just small sections from the ends closest to the handles. We fine this particularly disappointing......especially not knowing where these pieces have ended up!
2	Run large but stay put.
2	my puppy is not a very tough chewer and he shredded this thing in about 5 min. don't get me wrong, with the crinkle and the squeakers, he loved it but it's so soft and thin I cannot imagine a dog that would last more than 10 min with this thing. not worth the price
2	I've been using these for a few months and don't love them. The left earbud volume is significantly lower than the right, throwing off the balance. There's hard plastic node on each earbud that isn't covered by the silicon cover, causing pain during extended use. If you're using a larger sized bud, it may cover this. It's an issue for the one I need for my ear size, which also happens to be the default bud size out of the box. The carrying case is too small to accommodate the earbuds and wire, very difficult to fit into it without the buds coming apart and draining battery life. Battery life is average, sound quality (despite above issue) is okay. It's a decent value for the price, but has some issues.
2	my husband bought this for his lunch. he put in hot food and by lunch time, the food was cool. did not keep the food hot. Also the containers are too small.
2	I returned this device after it failed to consistently charge my phones. The 'tilt' feature is nice if it supported larger phones and didn't fall over.
2	Bought with the Catit track, but my cat couldn't care less about the blinking light. After a few days I noticed it seemed to be blinking all the time, or just seemed that way if walking by was enough motion to set it off. Either way, the battery only lasted a few weeks and it's already super dim.
2	I just bought them and with the first use they do not work very well. Sound goes from ear to ear abruptly and is very...annoying
2	GREat concept, nice design but in functionality it’s not worth it. Zipper broke on the first trip.
2	Wished I had read the reviews prior to buying as well. Same thing happen to mine as did to alot of people. It is coming apart already and I've only had it for just over a month.
2	Remote doesn't work, put new battery in it and still nothing. Stays on Green, none of the colors work, can't turn off unless I disconnect power
2	The film can't tell if it wants to be a serious supernatural psychological horror (like Jacob's Ladder or those crappy direct to video Hellraiser sequels) or if it wants to be a more cheeky horror comedy like Peter Jackson's early catalog (but without the slapstick and considerably absent gore). The ending just completely clashes with the pacing and feel of the film.
2	Well I really enjoyed this watch until last weekend in Moab. While sitting in the relaxing hot tub my watch screen went blank and the watch started to vibrate. I have tried multiple remedies. I believe it is no longer good.
2	I have to go back and change my review from a 4 to a 2 . After having the shoes a couple of months, the cushioning started to break down alot, then, on both shoes the seems around started spliting.
2	After 8 months it will no longer recharge via USB. Used minimally, probably a couple dozen times. Re charged once prior just fine. When it worked it was a great idea
2	I don’t know if what I received was someone else is return or what, but I am disappointed they did not even make the effort to remove the chalk from the rope or the wooden circles. The package was open already and had clear signs of use. I have yet to try them, first impression is that they look sturdy and durable.
2	Had a compressed disc between my L5 and S1. Took me 3 months to get back to 75%. I still get pain everyday but wanted to tone down my ibuprofen use. Gave these bad boys a try. No relief and gave me a slight stomach pain. Would not recommend.
2	Two of the four have broken through the first wall. Not recommended. Other brand has a lifetime warranty. I wish I’d spent the money.
2	Easy to install, but broke leat than 2 months after my install.
2	Very cute in the picture but meant for people with short torsos. It was definitely not cute on lol
2	The package was left on a small brick wall facing a busy street instead of by the front door where it would not be seen or stolen.
2	I hooked up the battery to my phone it kept on vibrating off and on showing that the battery was trying to charge but never held a charge can sit on there for about 15 minutes just kept on vibrating on and off and got quite annoying so I just took it out and shipped it back to you all I want to order another one but I am unsure of what to do next
2	Small and when slippery when wet, which kind if defeats the purpose.
2	This book was a disappointment! I typically can read straight thru in one setting. I struggled to keep focus. I was confused by the storyline. It felt thrown together and lacked passion. Ghost writer?? This is not the same author that i have enjoyed for years! Not worth it. Wait until it is a free read. I want my money back. Good reading is a result of excellent writing...this was not a good read!
2	Really really hard to put together, but it’s cute!
2	Thin material not something nice enough to wear to work.
2	I was really excited about these chargers. At first they worked great. Since purchasing every one has stopped working.
2	I returned due to these factors: The earbuds. They are generically shaped and not a one size fits all or customizable. One look to the left or right and they fall out. The volume level is far less than expected from similar products I've purchased in the same price point. Lastly, the battery performance was less than I had expected. Five to six hours was a maximum on full charge for me. I will attest to the ease of connectivity, sleek and minimal design, and lightweight of this product. Probably good for some; it's worth mentioning that there is no way to secure the earbuds when they are not in use. When unsecured they dangle freely around the neck or chest. They also pick up plenty of ambient noise as they all do. I hope this helps!
2	I’ve had several cases for my XS Max. Most from big name companies. They each have their pros and cons. Compared to the others, this UAG Pathfinder checks more boxes than any of them. Pros Lightweight Protective Tactile buttons Raised edges Great looks Tight fit Scratch resistant No fingerprints Precise cutouts (to accommodate asymmetrical speaker and mic holes) Cons Way too slippery Overall excellent case that I would recommend to anyone looking for one case that can do it all. ***UPDATE*** Sadly I had to return this case. I liked it for all the reasons mentioned above BUT I could not get past the slippery grip of this phone. If it were more textured or had TPU where the side grip pattern is it would help tremendously. I dropped the phone a few times by just by picking it up. The Monarch series is much grippier, but is just too bulky for a daily case in my opinion. I switched back to my Otterbox Symmetry until a better option comes along.
2	It was good for a few laughs thanks to Tiffany but overall it was kind of boring and definitely predictable.
2	I TAPPED A WALL WHILE PARKING. IT CRACKED IN 2 SPOTS
2	I returned it. The first batch burned and the burnt smell wouldn't wash out of the item. I couldn't store it in my cupboard without having that smell permeate.
2	I bought these to use as place cards for our wedding and they were unfortunately a let down. The picture makes them look larger, more uniform, and lighter than they actually are. I had some very, very small pieces that wouldn't fit a name on it and the color variation was all over the place (much darker than pictured).
2	it is to low. limited use for the space underneath.
2	Said it was fogless but it still steams up.
2	Took a few coats, strong smell and chips easy!
2	Just received these goggles today. I ordered the light blue for my wife earlier in the week. They sent a light baby blue band with a darker blue frame. I ordered myself the “blue” frame at an extra $10 because I really did not want baby blue frames, I was expecting a dark blue. I instead got a Very light baby blue frame (lighter then my wife’s) with a black and white strap. We leave in for a trip to steamboat soon. Disappointed that the order was not correct. As you can see from the first photo the black and white band with the “blue” lenses is actually baby blue.
2	gets dirty easy since the strap is cloth. I FEEL ITS TOOO SMALL for kids to read the time. the hour and minute hands get confusing because again the watch is tooo small. my daughter is 6 yrs old.
2	I need more magnification. It is my fault for not understanding how much magnification I would get according to the specs. For me, there was little change. This also feels a bit flimsy.
2	I’ll give this two stars because it does its job of covering my extra large pillow that a normal king size pillow case cannot do. However I ordered a grey color pillow case, and this is obviously blue which you can see against my grey and silver bedding. This is disappointing because I like everything to match and it should be the color I expect for $17. Also when I washed it, it became a lot rougher than when it arrived. It was very soft and silky feeling initially which I liked. Will update in a month or so to see how this holds up.
2	First one arrived broken, ordered a replacement and it also arrived broken. Clearly not satisfied.
2	Doesn't work on my system
2	Much smaller than I anticipated. I take blame for assuming it would have been a normal size coffee table
2	It’s smaller than I thought. Now I gotta look for another one now
2	At first I really liked this rest until holes started appearing in my fletchings. I realized that the round metal piece that holds the wire has a sharp edge that will rip the fletch on the arrow. I will try filing it down but now I have multiple arrows to repair, so I would recommend spending a little more to get a better rest.
2	Size is smaller than normal sizing
2	It can hold my phone securely without case but doesn’t work with phone case. So to use it the first I have to do is to remove my phone case
2	a good organizer, but began to rip at the middle bottom after several uses. won't buy again.
2	This product does not work. It is a waste of money.
2	Value is good because of the quantity. However the quality didn't impress me. I had a difficult time trying to twist the piece thru the sheet and mattress. The metal part would contort and bend making it even harder to get out and reinsert a new piece. Wish I had gone with a different method. .
2	The side stretch bunched from the top all the way through, looked as if I had a kangaroo pouch.
2	It seems like it would work really well except for it doesn't fit either one of my vacuums.
2	This product was not worth the price. One exploded and a few had bad tips.
2	LOVED it at first, but now its falling apart.
2	Order one size smaller than you normally wear. Medium felt like it was gigantic. I'll have to grow into it.
2	not what i expected and it didn't work for me at all
2	Smaller than I expected it to be
2	Im very top heavy so my dislike would be there are no straps to adjust the bra. I took the padding out and i wear this as a around the house/sleep bra. Very very comfy. Almost like i have nothing on.
2	Ordered a light grey and got an oat color
2	Liked the fabric. The camisole was very, very small!
2	Proof that Amazon and / or the vendors that post items for sale need to improve the user interface and layout for certain postings such as for this suit. There was no option to select the pants size, so I received a 30 waist x 32 inseam pants for a 38 R jacket. The jacket barely fits, but that is to be expected since it's a slim fit/ cut, but the pants are way too small, so essentially it's a $99 jacket and useless pants or return everything and shop elsewhere. You can figure out which option I chose, but I clearly won't be shopping on Amazon or this vendor again for a suit, no matter how good the price is. It just seems that you can't beat shopping at a retail store for clothing, shoes, among many other things.
2	Just purchased and upon air up, one of the balls has a hole... not a good impression for a brand new purchase. The red ball has no hole, but the blue one just cant handle the pressure.
2	Why make a product designed to be written on but put a coating on it so nothing will write on it? They are useless.
2	This impeller arrived with no shaft road, there was not even an option/recommendation to buy one, rather frustrating.
2	I have purchased three sets of these and had to return one set. I was then sent another set and they worked for a while, but now three more of my lights quit working. I am really tired of having to return these lights because it does cost for me to return them. I don't understand why they just quit working because one day they are working and the next day they are not. When they do work, they look great, but having some light and others not light does not look good. I am thinking about returning the three that quit working, but I am just tired of returning them.
2	As stated the quality and power of this unit does not match its price. The top panel controls are so so, Bluetooth on it is crap, and the remote only works by a weird 3.5mm cable with very limited range signal receiver on it. Oh and the sound quality is only good when you keep the volume modest though little bass to speak of. When you crank it the speaker quickly begins to distort. Literally just gave the device away.
2	I wanted to use this in the bedroom, to keep that room warm without heating the whole house at night. However, the fan noise is too loud to use while trying to sleep. And even with the heat off, and just the simulated flames on, it still makes more noise than you'd expect from the motors turning the led lights (I think that what it's doing anyways). I also noticed an almost imperceptible high-pitch hum when it's completely turned off but still plugged in, similar to the sound a crt tv makes when it's on mute. If you're looking for a quiet electric fireplace, keep looking :\
2	If you are buying them for the stylus they don't last very long although the pen part is great lasting a long time
2	They do not fill the space completely on my coupe. The space left between the light and the body is pretty bad
2	Not a fan of this blend, tastes like grass and doesn’t work to help me relax at all.
2	Never could get enough coins to play for more than a few minutes. Daily bonus never worked. I only pay for coins if a game is worth it. I don't think this one is.
2	Gun worked for a little over 30 days, just past the return window :( don’t waste your money. Used it for 4 days during that month. Bummer.
2	Beautiful puzzle but one of the pieces was a duplicate and the actual final piece was missing so it could not be fully completed.
2	I assumed it would be identical to the stuff that came with my Nutribullet but, the threading is slightly different and so when intermixed with the factory stuff, the top leaks or is almost too hard to remove.
2	Took as prescribed and it's not as powerful as it needed to be for me. Would it but again.
2	Pro: They are bright Con: cheap and break easily
2	I was looking forward to using the belly band for a little extra support (and, of course, to help offer a little extra coverage for the hemline of my tops)...unfortunately when it arrived it already fit extremely loose, so it wasn't of much use to me. The waist extenders came in handy during my first trimester, haven't used them since.
2	the filaments burn out quickly, and start flickering with very little use. would not buy again.
2	There is no arch support...I was looking for more of a shoe fit with the softness of a slipper. The fit is right and the softness...fine for sitting in front of the fireplace.
2	My cat is not interested in this at all!
2	It’s smaller than I expected so if you have a larger chest I suggest going a size up.
2	It start of spray foam for 2 second then goes to stream.. doesn't maintain the spray pattern so disappointed
2	It is very small and thin. The only thing I like about it is the color. I wish I would have read the reviews before buying it.
2	I DONT LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. BIG LETDOWN!!!!!!
2	I started the audiobook and had to hear how this is the new 'bible' of the black community. It is cringeworthy. This book is pure form excuse mode. It holds our culture back. Its finger pointing. Its blaming. Its lame literature. I am doing my best to finish(I am on chapter 4) as I listen on my work commute. This book has a very bitter tone.
2	It works okay for a short while but the insert's tongue that you slide into the wallet gets wrinkled too easily and the whole insert begins to fall out of your wallet everytime you open it after a short while. It is nothing like the original Rolf's wallet insert in which the tongue part that slides into the wallet was made of a thicker plastic to prevent the wrinkling that causes the inherent failure of this one. Unfortunately, I can't find Rolf's wallet inserts anymore. Luckily these don't cost very much but I guess you'll get what you pay for.
2	Didn't like it - gave it away. Too flimsy.
2	Per the product description, I was to get the drying rack, cleaning mat, and the brush cleaner. I received only the rack. Emailed the company, they did make a mistake and asked me to take a photo of what I did recieve. This was last week and I have not heard back even after a follow up email. However, the drying rack serves its purpose.
2	it's good but the quality of the straps is bad
2	I had to have a zipper installed otherwise I would have to remove costume completely to go pee.
2	I ordered this phone case by mistake. When I tried returning it, they gave me 4 options. I could get a code to be scanned at UPS store for $5.99 and have that amount deducted from my return, I could drop off at USPS for $5.99 and again have it deducted from my return, I could use a UPS dropoff for $5.99 with the deduction once again from my return OR I could have UPS pick it up for $11.99 and owe them money and no return. I was not given the option for printing it out even though the options started with "no printer, no problem!" I only gave them 2 stars instead of 0 stars is because the case looks like quality work through the packaging.
2	The biggest issue with this is most of the pictures make it seem like a single wire charges the device. This is not the case unlike a similar product I purchased which had all the apple cables plug into the device all powered by one cable. This is just a stand for the watch and AirPod and you will need to plug three wires in and have them dangling from the back of this product. Unfortunately the description is not clear about this and I had to return it and get the other unit.
2	Wire is fine. However the connectors certainly do not work very well. The part of the connector that attaches to the wire is not the issue. The problem lies where the connector attaches to the tape. The way this part works is by the pins in the connector punching through the bottom side of the tape in order to make a connection to the copper on the top of the tape. Even with the sticky back removed the pins making contact with the copper is very hit or miss. I found the only way I can get a solid connection is to remove the silicon top of the tape and placing it on the bottom of the tape and install the tape upside down in the clip. I found that this gave me a solid connection each time with out failure. This method certainly negates the waterproof aspect at the connector, but is works.
2	There is no reason for a film to be 2.5 hours long. I connected with nothing and shut it down quickly.
2	I wish to return this product, It was not what I could use. I'm still waiting for information how to do this. I was not given a return label. I received no other directions.
2	I thought this would be a bit more practical or fashionable. There was a point in time where I walked to work every morning at 3AM in the dead of winter to open a coffee shop. A product like this would be perfect to keep the heavy winds off the face, however any other conditions this head covering is a bit much. Also, the head cover came WAY too large. The part meant to cover the mouth/chin would sag downward to my throat.
2	The shoes are two-piece. The inner sole which is a different locks into place by pushing through the sole in the pattern seen on the bottom of the shoe. These are now releasing and the sole is otherwise falling apart. I've just used them sparingly for around the house shoes. I'll be going with the more expensive 1 piece version from the name brand competitor.
2	The package was opened when I Received it
2	I usually love Neutrogena sunblock but this was a miss. The spray idea seems great but even with being careful and purposely rubbing it in I still had blotchy application. But honestly, the real problem might have more to do with the product than the applicator. This stuff has no staying power. I learned the hard way that any real contact with fabric (seat belts of tank top straps) will wipe it right off, and forget about water exposure. Even reapplying every hour I still got toasted. Next time I'll stick to the Sport version in the regular spray can.
2	Missing a very important part. Waiting on seller to contact me and see if they will send the missing part. Box was damaged so it may have fell out.
2	As I was taking these out of the package, one of the threader ends fell off! Poor quality
2	Well acted. I love the lead actors, but otherwise, ho-hum
2	I've bought other rings and they have served a better purpose than this one. Part of it was because I thought this one was going to be heavier and more solid than the other ones; my fault for buying w/o reading the description. However, this ring isn't much different than any others out there that are stretchy plastic; no advantage or disadvantage to getting it aside from the price. So, having other rings already, the purchase of this one was useless for me.
2	Battery dies after one full length movie on battery power even at minimum brightness. The RAM included is hardly enough to keep excel, word and email going at the same time.
2	The necklace design is great for everyday wear and my mom absolutely loved it but my moms necklace broke and came apart within 4 days of wearing it. Since it’s so lightweight she didn’t realize it until it was too late and couldn’t find the charm.
2	Not even close to the color shown. Shape was more like a bell, very wide at the bottom and a wide collar. But the worst part.... It smelled like smoke! gross! Will be returning!
2	Been using the battery for over a year. the first one I got was busted and the company was quick to get another one back to me. The new one worked well for a while but now it is doing weird things like I leave it charged in the wall for several days and only 2 dots are blinking, it is not as fast to give out the charge so it takes a while to charge. I honestly stopped using them because it was so annoying to deal with all of these issues and my husband has a battery we like better.
2	This humidifier is built for the worst possible means of cleaning it up. With the small brush they provide wouldn’t even help to go through the multiple redundant edges inside the product. Not built with intelligent.
2	I deliver groceries and these are not holding up at all. The seam has split on several of the bags, just below the zipper. If it’s for occasional use, they will probably hold up just fine.
2	Update: Had to return this light. Pressure switch wires broke on install. Recieved another one, same thing. I'm not even bothering with returning this one. Just going to solder it better than the factory. Unfortunately it's a piece of crap. The flash light and the mount and charger seem to be fine but, the pressure tape is flippin garbage. First review:Very bright! Looks to be well made. It's a good deal for sure. 2 rechargeable batteries and a charger! Wow.
2	It made my skin burn! Around my eyes
2	It's ok. I like my old Oral B one better. I am actually going to switch back. I feel like my teeth still feel grimy after brushing even if I extend the time beyond the two-minute brush time. I also didn't enjoy all the different settings.
2	Fit sorta baggy around the knees, the fabric is exactly like a wet suit, so good luck running in it. I returned it. Waaaaay to thick to actually exercise in, and doesn't fit snug enough to wear as wet suit shorts. GO NAME BRAND
2	too small for my puppy. i didn't wanna go through the trouble of returning or exchanging, so i just gave it away.
2	Started out loving it, but it broke after just 2 months of us. It didn't rust, but it also didn't last. ☹️
2	One of the bands broke shortly after wearing it, other than that it seemed nice to wear.
2	I would not recommend this pillow. Is not firm enough and goes flat after using for a while.
2	I would have to press it down so hard.
2	According to my teacher there were alot of mistakes in this book. Which makes it hard to follow along with the codes. My teacher has to update the corrections for us. Which is very confusing to a beginner in programming
2	Not what I expected, my baby did not like it.
2	won't work with onkyo speakers... option 2 real fake. Not firm not stable.
2	I thought this would be a great thing to help our dog stop barking but it hurt the dog even on low. It ran continuously even when there was no barking or sound in the house. I would stand close to it and watch it and the green light would light up with no sound at all in the house. Our dog would shake with pain, hid under the bed or in corners when it was on and on low. The dog would stop shaking and act normal when disconnecting the battery after a few minutes and start shaking and hiding when reconnecting the battery. This tells me it is on continuously and not working as it should be. Sad. It is a good idea but dose not work. Returning to Amazon.
2	I don't like this case at all. Coming from a dreem case on my last 2 phones this thing has most things wrong. The strap that holds the cover closed is attached to the back of the case and makes it so awkward closing the phone when it should be so simple. When in landscape mode to watch a video there the strap is again sticking out like a sore thumb. Who designed this thing. The on/off button is very hard to operate in this case. It takes multiple attempts to turn the phone off/on. Terrible design. In fact other than being a nice looking case this thing is subpar and poorly designed. I really don't understand all the good reviews here. Finally, these type case should be designed to have the phone in a magnetic removable case. Talking on the phone requires folding the case open on this thing and that would be eliminated with the removable case or at least give you the option if you wanted to. Once again the removable magnetic case kills it. That is extremely convienient and something that Dreem came up with and has since been copied by other companies. I definately would not recommend this case. I am waiting for Dreem to come out with the xs max version so I can dump this pig.
2	Just received these was really upset that these did not fit .. I changed the ear tips but they would not stay in my ears . I was really looking forward to using these.
2	This still leaks. Every single time your child puts this down to the side, it will leak. It’s not spill or leak proof. We have four and they all do it. Ruined my couch.
2	Looks nice, seems sturdy. But it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to press the side buttons.
2	I used this for an N64 and the resulting picture was too dark to play the game. Returned it for another adapter that worked much better.
2	The product was cute and I hoped it would help my dog after her surgery, but it only lasted 3 days. My dog managed to take it off while wearing the e-collar and ripped it to pieces. Waste of money on my part.
2	This backdrop was very orange toned not at all like in the picture shown. Very thin material
2	Doesn't catch mouse's, and easily breaks.
2	this app shows the programs and shows but keeps buffering while watching a show. Sometimes i have to restart my tablet to go back to the show i was watching. not happy with this app.
2	It broke within 30 days. The part connected to my computer fell apart.
2	Third time I've bought this twin pack of ink for my printer...first time, cartridges were great. They loaded fine and printed many pages (I'm a school teacher, so I use my printer several times daily.) With the second order, the first cartridge I put in leaked ink all over and did not work at all. The other in the twin pack worked fine. Overall, I'm bummed the one didn't work out but thought it was a good buy for the money. Since it's much cheaper then buying new, I took my loss. Third time I bought the twin pack, the first cartridge wouldn't be recognized in the printer but the second one has worked so far (two days.) I'm done buying these because it's not worth the hassle of thinking your getting two and then really only getting ONE that works.
2	Being advertised as heavy duty for work pants, I assumed this item would be great. Unfortunately, this is NOT the case. The gap is too wide for most belt thicknesses, but I wear a much thicker belt which holds my tool pouch, and the back strap still occasionally comes unfastened. Not only will it not stay on my belt, the adjustment on the front straps will NOT stay in position. It is just the "friction" type and a person should be able to clamp this in position to remain as adjusted for comfort. I might try to heat the fasteners as I have read others doing, but I think the manufacture should correct these faults
2	i have medium feet and my toes are totally squashed. the chevron variety of this brand is nice and comfortable. these are crazy tight.
2	Not as large as advertised. Found a pre-teen to give it to.
2	What a pain in the butt to use. You might have better luck selling things by hand trying to constantly re-thread of this little bugger .
2	Good for a wedding or high school prom.
2	This mat is softer than I’d like, my heels dig in whenever I stand on it and it makes me feel unstable. I use it in front of my sink and it keeps moving around on my bamboo floor and I keep tripping on the corners. I wouldn’t buy it again.
2	The beginning of this book wandered from one point to another. Kept reading and finally by mid point I cared about the characters. But at just over half read I could not go on. The horrific cruelty depicted...I read fiction to escape from the injustice and inhumanity of this life...this was revolting enough to give me nightmares.
2	I ordered the Batman. It's ok other then that it does not adhere to your phone. They need to change the adhesive.
2	Thought the real singers voice would be on this
2	The material is a bit thin and the color is more of a faded olive rather than the vibrant olive pictured.
2	Have not received the product
2	I have many pairs of fitflops. The footbed has a different cover and makes annoying sounds. I do not recommend. I wish I returned
2	It smells great, but it’s just a bin of loose coffee grinds. Wasn’t expecting that.
2	Motion detection didn't work 90% of the time. The camera is on the bottom tip of the light bulb so you need a bendable light fixture to put the light bulb so that the camera can see the whole body height. Otherwise you have to mount on the ceiling light which requires no bottom cover so the camera can point down. Live view is very good though. Definitely need to improve motion recording. I am returning this.
2	I noticed no difference after months.
2	They lasted 2 times the 3 time the put It broke into pieces so i had to buy a new one at the pool that cost me twice as this one
2	This makes a creaking sound when it's on. I guess my small crystal service award is too heavy?
2	The first one came and the lights didn’t work. I exchanged it and the second one was missing the light controller, there were just two bare wires. If it worked I would have kept it but am done wasting my time on this one.
2	These are smaller than the ones that came with my garden. They might be fine for starting in pots, but don't know. Hard to get seeds in so small. Will not order again.
2	These appeared to be very high quality upon opening, but after using for a few weeks, I've noticed they are very fussy. Everything has to be aligned just right in order to re-connect the lock. It also seems to be becoming harder to turn the numbers after only a few weeks. I'm not expecting this to last more than a year.
2	For fitness information this was fine but as a watch it was totally inadequate. It was impossible to see the time display outdoors, even if shaded. Even indoors if it was tapped too long the time disappeared and moved to the next mode. I couldn’t find a way to make it brighter or less sensitive. Useless as a watch!
2	The songs were sung too fast and the words were not very clearly heard. Hard for youngsters to get / understand the messages.
2	This was very large and just fell right off me. Not very good material either. For reference I am 5’4 and 140lbs and I got the medium.
2	Did not like top snapping at angle never stays put.
2	The case is ok.. my biggest complaint is that the printer does not fit if you have the battery attached, it is way to much of a pain to take the battery off all the time so i will be returning this. The second issue is that the case had a horrible smell when it arrived
2	I purchased this product last year. And it was put in basement for almost one year. I found grease tray is missing when I opened box and used it last week. You know how I found this when I grilled. Could you please mail me a grease tray or tell me where I can find one? Thanks
2	This is not at all a remote for smart tv's, it's just a cool wireless keyboard.
2	DID NOT GIVE ME THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HEAD BOLTS. HAD ONLY 3 SHORT BOLTS AND 1 EXTRA LONG BOLT. HAD TO BUY ANOTHER SET TO FINISH THE JOB
2	This was cheesy and a boring.
2	The worst product. Just OK. Pure rubbish!
2	Disappointing. Can't control iPhone SE with buttons (volume, pause, skip). Thought it was supported. Just plain headphones.
2	Was disappointed with this heater. It is confusing to use. Remote has to be close to work. Not worth the price.
2	It looks nice! Solid construction. However I wanted something easy and quick. You get any oil on it and it slips in your hand so you constantly have to wipe it off after each spray. Also, it is NOT ergonomic by any means. You have to really bunch your fingers and hold it at the top so your fingers don't slip and to depress the button - or you need long fingers. The button HURTS! Hard grooved plastic and a flat edge - that digs into your finger every time you press it. And since it's not aerosol, you need to press it a lot. It does not spray for me evenly at all - even on first use, I got maybe 2 full sprays, then it went right to a thin stream of oil, with intermittent spray. And when it does spray, it gets everywhere! Lands on the oven, lands on your hand, a lot in the air... will have to go back to a metal air pump spray.
2	These are soft towels. I bought these because I was hoping for a good quality towel (premium in title). I washed them as soon as I got these. They produced so much lint that I thought they were defective: clothing with which these were washed still have lint that accumulated on them. I have been using these for the last 2 weeks and there is still lint falling off them in the bathroom and after each use. I'm not sure of their long-term durability but for the price I don't think they are worth it. I like that they are organic, but seems like the trade-off is substantial. I've never used or owned towels that produce so much lint. For this reason I would not purchase these again.
2	These kept us cool but the pitch they came in was complete junk. Carefully opening the bag and the plastic zipper broke. Could not use the bag on ALL 4 of these. Had to use a ziploc bag which did work.
2	Monitor didn't work and I had to return it back
2	the gel cushion was very uncomfortable and kept slipping out of the adhesive. the medicated component works really well
2	This was advertised as a Genuine GE Factory Part and it was definitely an aftermarket part. That is why the price is less. Did not return it because could not wait addition time to get a GE part. While it seems to be working, uncertain of its durability. The number of coils in the element is approaching half of the genuine part. The low rating partially a reflection of the sellers deception.
2	Hate the material it’s itchy and scratchy no stretch and two small I wear an 18-20 and got the XXXL and it’s to small and tight. Will be returning
2	Fit oversized but not in a good way.
2	Connections wiggle and cause sound to cut in and out. They are just average sound quality and comfort. Not impressed, sent back for a refund which was promptly given, kudos for that.
2	I purchased the eye cream and put it under my eyes 2 times a day. I didnt notice a difference.
2	Super gross after leaving it in my shower just for two days! It collects hair but it causes the water to rise in my tub then gets muck everywhere.
2	Cordless unit caused the GFI and trip and not the unit will not charge at all.. Dead.. Nice unit, easy to use takes two tanks with of water to do the job, one for bottom and one for top teeth. NICE UNIT if it was working. I will be contacting the manufacture for the 2 year warranty.
2	Unsettling and not what I'd pick when thinking of Spike Lee. Story of blood-drinking set amidst luxury furnishings. Pass.
2	2 of the cars were broken out of the box did not go when you pulled back
2	One star for how quickly I received the plane. One star for the plane not being damaged during shipping. I took off three stars for How Small this plane is. I didn’t know it was this small.
2	Did not work well for me
2	The zipper at the top stripped when we received the bag. I could not fix this so the bag was not usable.
2	They didn’t work for what I had in mind. Not that bright. I ended up keeping them because my grand daughter wanted them. I told her they might work good in her beta fish tank because it was a small area. I probably would have needed about 20 pkgs to show any light in my area. A tiny, tiny area would work.
2	[UPDATE March 6, 2019] I have to admit this is not what I had hoped for. The wifi repeaters that was sent to extend the signal of the cameras means that every camera has to be COMPLETELY uninstalled and taken down from the walls and roofs that they are mounted to, which means cutting the conduit tubing that is protecting the wires since they are outdoors. THEN bringing each camera inside to the nvr and programming each one once connected to the nvr. Then after all that HOPEFULLY it all WORKS! (<--probably won't) Then at that point we can go back and completely install each camera like we had originally mounted them. So that means all new screws, new tubing, more time and definitely MORE MONEY wasted!!! Had I known this I promise I never would have bought these. Another problem is that even with a couple of the units that are close enough to have a FULL signal record in odd increments! The playback of the video shows there's motion but then completely SKIPS and JUMPS through all that motion so you can never even see what actually triggered that motion to begin with. I have it setting to record all cameras 24/7 plus I have motion to record in the 'continue setting' but like I say they jump allover the place. HORRIBLE. I can only assume the people that state they love this system and that are "Verified Purchases" must have some tiny houses cause they don't have these issues. And must have extensive networking experience cause I still can't even get these to port-forward through my router correctly to view them from our mobile devices when we are not at home. ---------------------------------------- I purchased the 8 camera 1080p wireless system with 2TB drive already installed and at first had a few problems with these cameras maintaining connection. By contacting customer service we discovered the house and distance between the cameras and the NVR was simply too large and far between. Grace with their great customer service team advised that even a longer antenna would not suffice so instead she acquired approval to have them send a wifi repeater or extender system that will essentially make up for the distances. I hope once that is all set up, installed, and programmed that it should all be working great then.
2	I liked this product when I first got it, even though 2 of the cables never worked. Soon after another cable quit and today the entire thing won’t work. It was great .... when it worked, both months
2	I normally wear a med/leg, I bought a 3xl, still couldn't button it. I gave it 2 stars only because the quality of the shirt itself was great. I used it for a pin up photo shoot. I wore a t shirt under it and left it open. Worked great, but can never actually wear it.
2	At least the second one was not broken i opened the package and the first one had numerous cracks i installed it anyway as installed as i had to be off to work.
2	Couldn't tell the difference between my regular readers and putting these on.
2	Wrong color was sent.
2	I have fine hair. Used product t for 30 days to see if it would help with frizziness. Would not recommend. Also smells very earthy.
2	to tight on my legs,and my legs are normal sized
2	While the sound is decent there are a couple of bad flaws. The worst by far is that while plugged in, either thru USB or AC adapter and playing music the speaker emits an electronic noise. If the speaker turned up enough you can't hear the noise much but for quiet listening it's annoying. The second flaw make the main flaw worse. When running on battery the speaker will not shut off by itself when not playing music. This means that speaker will frequently run out of battery so you have to plug it in to use it and hence have to listen to the noise.
2	Went from fitting to, too small to button after one wash.
2	Aesthetics wise looks great, very thin screen and base is stylish. What was driving me crazy was when in Excel the ribbons looked blurry, tried to capture the blurriness in the pic, it looks worse in reality. I did all sorts of screen settings, including factory default, but no luck. I was at Best Buy and grabbed a 27in Dell on special, plugged in and checked Excel and it was nice and crisp. Thought it could be the cheap hdmi cable I got for the Acer was causing the issue, but tried the hdmi cable that came with the Dell and still had the issue. Returning the Acer and keeping the Dell.
2	Bought these to keep my new stove cleaner so that splatters would not get on the burners. They don't look the greatest, but they did cover the burner. These are thin and cheap and if you turn the wrong burner on, the paint on these will flame up in a short time. I threw mine in the trash. If I buy covers again, I will go back to the solid, heavy, enameled ones that are safer and look better.
2	With the Juul device & charging port adapter, the case only holds two additional pods. I could live with this if I could close then reopen the case. I could barely open the case initially. I thought that would improve with use. IT didn't. Poor quality!
2	It worked well when I first got it, but after a month of use, it started tearing and I ended up having to replace it with a different product.
2	No seal over the container which is actually unsettling. Bottle more than half empty
2	Why is there a drawstring? The picture and description doesn’t mention anything about the suit having a drawstring around the neck. The velcro width is thin but strong, which is the only pro. The fabric feels like spandex, which idk if it’s a good thing or a bad thing. I purchased this and the exact same one from a different seller for $1 more, and the more expensive one didn’t come with a drawstring and had a wider velcro. Returning this and keeping the other.
2	Waited three weeks to arrive. Now can't put it together it's missing a leg! HOW DO PEOPLE PACK AND SHIP THREE LEGS??? Contacted company,haven't heard back yet. If it turns out okay I'll change my review. But right now not good!
2	My daughter who is 9 months old can pull them off the corners.i really had high hopes for this.
2	Downloaded shazam as a change to sound hound. Tried and failed a few times, returned to sound hound.
2	The design concept is good. However, the actual product delivered was horrible quality! The biggest con for me is that NONE of the pockets fit a standard sized paper. My resumes ended up getting wrinkled. The folder slots are thin, cheap, plastic.
2	Fits good, has lasted well. Not nearly as protective as other similar cases I've had. I dropped my phone on the case end from counter height and the glass broke at that end. Finished it off when I dropped it from off the top of a stroller, landed face down and the ridge wasn't enough to protect even with tempered glass on there. Shattered tempered glass and actual phone glass. Older cases I've had similar to this one (and cheaper) that stuff didn't hurt the phone at all.
2	I bought many T-shirts in the same price range but this one looks poor in quality, also size is in appropriate as mentioned in the chart. not worth spending more than $8 for this product, I got better quality from other bands at lesser price
2	The boots are very cute, but they are flimsy. When you walk in them you can feel the rocks under your feet and it sorta hurts. I wouldn’t buy them again. I would find a better sole.
2	Very narrow, to put any refuse into it you basically have to fight the elastic opening.
2	My daughter just received her outfit and absolutely loves it! However, this “brand new” outfit has BLOOD stains on it and loose threads all over the collar of the jersey. I’m absolutely disgusted and very disappointed! I won’t let my daughter touch this outfit, let alone try it on. The sizing looks accurate so that’s a plus.
2	Didn’t last very long! Gave it to a friend after I upgraded phones and it only lasted her about a week until it rarely would charge the phone. Planning on returning it.
2	Only one worked. Spring door of second didn't catch, tried to bend the metal clasp, doesn't work. Used in yard for chipmunk issue, the critters can open squeeze under get and entire back piece off..caught no camera. Taped back shut, working. But expensive e for me trap that needs taping to function
2	Don't bother. I knew "whodunit" about half way through. I finished the book but was annoyed. Also, there are a few times where the wrong character is referenced. That's just shoddy editing.
2	This product only last 8 months. The power charger dead so quick. Disappointed. Have search another one.
2	Unless it get's full bright sunlight these do not work. In the time I have had them outside they have worked 4 of the 14 days I've had them.
2	Doesn’t connect well with my pc, windows 10.
2	Brought sunscreen in one of the silicone containers on a trip, but within 24 hours, it had completely dried up and cracked. I'm not sure if it was a reaction with the silicone or a seal issue, but I won't be using the silicone again.
2	The cover up was nice but the balls looked very cheap. Kinda like a child’s craft. Wouldn’t recommend. Maybe if the balls were all one color or a different material. It was like the craft balls you get for crafts. I don’t see these holding up well if they got wet.
2	Not great I am a size 16 and these jeans are a bit small if I wear a belt they will stay up otherwise I am yanking them up every few minutes. My husband says they look good.
2	Seeds come in a zip lock bag not secured which was open about 2 inches allowing 1/3 of the tiny seeds to spill out ! Dont know how many have been lost . Reading the product review this is not the first time this has happened . At least double bag the seed next time ! I think they owe me a pound of seed !
2	I absolutely loved the design of this shirt. Ordered a 2x which is what I always wear. 6 ft tall 300 lbs. couldn’t get the 2x short over my head. Neck was so tight it cut off circulation. Didn’t even make it down to my belly button. Gave shirt to my wife who is 5ft 1 and 100 lbs. Fit her fine. So men’s 2x fits like a women’s medium. Loved the silk like material and design though. Just wished it was a true 2x.
2	The screw on nozzle is a bit loose. Liquids will spill out instead of from the nozzle.
2	You certainly "get what you pay for". Everything is kinda flimsy. The chairs don't sit well. My kid can't scoot all the way up to the table with his legs under it. Thats the biggest reason I only gave it 2 stars. Fix that. The table takes my lego blocks and everyone enjoys that feature.
2	Foam is flaking off and comes through material on top and leaves a residue on top of chairs. Can not even get it off with a lint brush. Very unsatisfied.
2	Kind of shiny and not for me.
2	UPDATE: I bought an adapter so it will work after all! Yay! First of all, the finial is beautiful! That being said, I failed to check the thread width and this finial didn't have a large enough thread opening for my lamp. I'll keep it though because it's lovely,and I'm sure there will be another lamp I can use it on. Like the small lamp in our guest room or another small lamp in our master bath.
2	Some runes were missing, others were duplicated. The gold paint was all over the stones.
2	Giving it a 2 not because of the quality of product Did not have a chance to test it It tell and broke as soon as I tried to open the bottle Did not buy another one but arnica is very good for inflammation
2	Returned immediately. It was extremely slippery in my hand and I knew it would lead to me dropping it a lot.
2	the lanyard and clasp seem like they are crafted with good quality materials for sure. however, i don't know if i like how the clasp opens and closes. my house key fell off the lanyard and i almost lost it in the parking lot...i found it under someone else's car. so be very careful if you use this. the design is just okay. i ordered the marble one and it seems more brown than the photo is.
2	Not enough cards, run through them pretty fast and then its over.
2	Hat seems ok but the flower is cheap iron on or painted on. I doubt it will last.
2	Cheaply made, doesn't pair half the time, and the sound cuts in and out a lot.
2	i had to send this back, not for cats
2	Dividers are durable and all 10 arrived in package BUT it did NOT include blank White Labels As Advertised.
2	It was shipped in an envelope brim all crushed up took me a while to bend it back to shape would of sent it back didn’t want to go thru hassles
2	Purchased in Jan 2018, the mouse was rock solid until now when the scroll wheel intermittently doubles back on me when scrolling down. Even with a new battery, the scroll is not as smooth as it once was and that's disappointing.
2	Hard to use. Doesn't effectively cut the dough. Also doesn't come with instructions.
2	Only used few times very thick difficult to remove product from bottle I purchased 2 bottles both the same very difficult to remove from bottle Dropper doesn’t have enough suction to remove from bottle No scent, thick just use little bit to start with Don’t think I will repurchase
2	Not what I expected, picture is deceiving. The design is poorly printed instead of a pretty stitch like it looks from afar in the picture. It is soft but I would not purchase another one. Just not pretty.
2	When this works it’s great. But the batteries fail quickly. I’ve had this for just a year & used lightly and the battery won’t hold a charge.
2	The bottom part fit like a glove. It snapped right into place and left room for the USB-C port. However, the top shell fits really awkwardly. The top shell is not a snug fit, and it has a whole cut out for the apple logo, so you can see where it’s not on securely and the cutout is uneven. Also, it came with scratches freshly out of the package. It’s cheaply made and doesn’t give me a piece of mind with how it fits. It’ll have to do, until I find something better.
2	I am 130 lbs, sleep alone and have memory foam mattress.. this bed frame should not be squeaking like this. Its loud and frightening when I am half asleep. I wish there was a way to send this back.... I did alot of research and chose this bed based one height and visual.. but it's not worth the noise.
2	Matches description, not picture! Super small items, too expensive.
2	A bit predictable I had to make myself finish reading it Did not make me want to read more books by this author
2	The case is more ROSE gold than a metallic gold that the picture displays. Good case, but more on the feminine side.
2	Great scent distribution and large water capacity, but it has a loud buzz when running.
2	Misshapen badly and its filled with hardly any large pieces of confetti. When it claims to be filled with lots of glitter.
2	I bought this bag for traveling and probably some hiking if I get to it. Overall, not a bad bag. I was able to fit most of my stuff in it, lots of space. The only issue I have had so far is when I opened the rain cover pocket to pull out the rain cover to test it out, it came all the way out. Meaning that the end cord was not attached to anything, so they likely sent me a damaged bag.
2	I like it as a hot tea or a iced cold tea. It has bad after taste but it’s better with agave syrup.
2	These worked for about a week and then they didn’t stick anymore. Very disappointed.
2	Case started peeling after a month
2	It started to unravel within 2 weeks.
2	Couldn't fit my controller in the charge station after I put this on.
2	It is more lemony a little bitter. Not like the original lemon tea. I hope to find some original in a store and enjoy it until it runs out.
2	doesn't have a auto/on/off function I want to have the ability to keep it on or have it auto motion 😔..and a dimming option is a plus.. I might return it
2	I purchased this for my daughter for high school. It looked ok and worked fine for a week but then all four corners of the case broke and her computer was cracked. Will never be buying again. was shitty
2	It's a Good case but it Turns Yellow after a while
2	I could not get this to work properly. It was spewing out when I turned 2 liter upside down. Not sure if it’s defective but I was disappointed in this product.
2	This product is NOT as easy to use as most the videos and advertisements would like you to believe. You MUST use two hands to put this on, and they do come in a variety of sizes. You can easily launch what you are trying to cover across your counter top if you are not careful. (I've done it!) The covers are not that easy to put on and must make sure that NO moisture/water is on what you are trying to cover! I do not recommend this product.
2	I don’t know about the durability and sturdiness. The pans were pushed in on one side. They should have shipped in a box and not an envelope. Size why they are perfect for what I am going to use them for.
2	I did not receive the recipe book
2	crazy tiny... didn't end up using because so small
2	Thermometer works but the string is weak. Broke after 1 week
2	This blow dryer doesn't work too well on thin hair, and even worse on thick hair. It does has lots of air coming out, but it's not hot. As a consequence, it takes about 20 minutes of full power to dry my daughter's very thin hair, and about one hour to dry mine (thinker and longer hair). I don't have time to waste in drying my hair, and my 4 years old doesn't have the patience to sit there that long. I won't suggest you to buy this product, unless you have very thin and short hair, or lots of time to waste!
2	Unless you are a real techno, steer clear! There is nothing intuitive about this program.There are button and tabs missing the guide does not flow well, and the only assistance is an online forum that is not searchable. The only reason it gets 2 stars is that a forum user wrote back to me the next morning. Very difficult to use, even for the simplest no-music, no fancy stuff picture slide show. Used to love (and was able to use) Microsoft DVD Maker. This has been two all-night frustration sessions...
2	The product didn’t perform like the description said it
2	Does the job.... but poorly. Not very fashionable either. There are better options on the the market.
2	These fangs look great but the glue instructions are not in English. I've tried youtube and google- anyone have any instructions on how to apply these? I also played with the glue to powder ratio with no success. Any help would be great- i have a Halloween party coming up! :o)
2	Product was fairly easy to install and lack manuals. Leave everything hooked up out of the box and it all works. The biggest draw back is the operating system sucks! You can't change the unit of measure, the radio is outrageously clunky and harder to use than the stock. Couldn't get it to work with my cars computer for next and previous track. to get the backup camera to work you solder the reverse wire for the bus to the reverse wire on the white aux plug. Nothing in the instructions states to do this. Oh spend the extra money on wireless transmitter and avoid running wire from front to back.
2	Every time i buy this it keeps going up in price . This time by $3.00
2	I bought them for my 13-year old son. Within minutes, he already had a hole in one of them. After that, I explained to him that he cannot stretch the balls as much as he might like. Another weird thing about them is that they are a bit sticky so when my son tried to bounce it on the floor (it really does not bounce) it picked up all the cat hair and dirt on the floor.
2	This pen was a disappointment. After all the talk about how great the pen was, how it was the best brush pen money could by (and it wasn't cheap), I was let down. The brush tip began to split after a few uses, just like every other brush pen I've owned. I've yet to find a brush pen that is functional for professional inking and this is no exception. A sable brush is still the best option for inking.
2	The costume itself is pretty cute, but as soon as I unwrapped It I could see there are green mold spots on it. There is also orange/brown spots all over the white parts. This picture was taken right after opening the package. I will attempt to hand wash this to try to get the mold spots off but I am not hopeful. At least I will be able to neutralize the mold smell. Very disappointing.
2	Cheaper quality material. Wouldn’t buy again but for the 6 washes they will be able to handle they fit great!
2	We are very disappointed that our bed is already sagging where we sleep. We only sleep on this mattress half the month, and we are not obese. Also, I was under the impression the mattress was made in the US. It is not; it was made in China.
2	I loved how these looked, and actually loved the fit, however, the sole is not a rubber like you would expect with sneakers, it is more like plastic, and makes a sound when you walk. will not be buying from this company again
2	Wanted this stuff to make molds of plastic. I ordered a total of 3 and in each one the Part A was solidified beyond use. I know this has a limited shelf life but I tried to use it the day I got it and it was like this. I recommend using a different silicone.
2	My friend said this was the best eye glass cleaner. I loved that it has it's own case and is light to carry. But I don't see that it cleans my glasses so well. I bought one for my husband and he felt the same way. Too bad, good idea.
2	They look just like the pic and I'm sure they'll be durable but I could not put it together with the knobs provided. They suck and arent properly lined up!! Kept popping out. I will be going to get zip ties. Smh
2	Bumper came with scratches and a dent that cracked the chrome. The top pad also wasn’t attached correctly. This has caused me to miss an important deadline. Only upside is it came a day early.
2	Box was damaged not good packing
2	Nice flowing fit. Very thin material. You can see through it.
2	This book is overrated. It is difficult for my baby to press the buttons when the pages arent correctly lined up. My one yr old son loves music and to press buttons but this one he lost interest relatively quickly.
2	I am sorry but the smell is that of regular hair spray:( I can't use it or anything with a smell OR it was the particular can itself.
2	This is definitely the worst of the Detective Dee features so far. The most annoying aspect is perhaps the ludicrous CGI, but the plot is also thew weakest so far, leaning far too heavily on "magic" (as increasingly Chinese movies and dramas do) One wonders what audience this is intended for. Overall judgment: Just plain silly.
2	I tried this product, but felt (could not discern) any positive (or negative) effects.
2	Found them to be not very absorbent. Rough. Dainty looking yes but not quite what I needed.
2	This wasn’t going to work for what I needed. Part of the weaving was even coming undone. Didn’t even open the second one. Both returned with shipping deductions. Would not order again.
2	Received lunch box and the color is nice for a male. It was so flattened that I do not know how functional it will be. The zipper was very hard to line up to close. Disappointed in the quality.
2	Hard time picking up Wii remotes. Very off with the actual movement of the remotes
2	I bought this item because it was advertised as "Cuddly Sleepers 100% Hypoallergenic Toddler Pillow w/ TWO FREE PILLOWCASES! Dr. Recommended. Made in USA." but to my disappointment, there were no pillowcases included and they even crossed off on the label that the pillowcases were included.
2	They are not the size listed. Gave 2 stars because I can still eventually use them just not for the project I intended.
2	I bought this February 3 Return window ended March 5 Today is March 20 and a corner of the Kindle cover broke off This is the second time that a product made by this company did the same thing I’m wondering how long the rest of it will last I don’t recommend anyone buy from this company
2	I have mix feelings about this product. I have purchased different stickers in the last year. Some have worked excellent but some have been terrible. The clown fish, the dolphin and whale stickers have lasted long on my son's bathtub. However, the shark started coming off two weeks after I installed them. Two of the five turtles I installed came off just two days after I installed them. Seems like quality control on the adhesive part is no good at all.
2	Came fast but broke quick too. Of course the price was very low sooooo.
2	Could barely taste the coconut flavoring
2	The wallet part of the Case is nice but the part that holds my LG Zone 4 is loose and doesn't hold the phone well its almost like it was stretched out and used before on a slightly bigger phone. Not impressed at all might return.
2	I'm disappointed with this shirt. It already started getting holes in. Whitch is a bummer because it's super comfy and adorable.
2	Doesn’t work for the DC universe streaming app which is the main reason I bought it. I’ve had a different one before that did work with the DC app so my guess is this one is just really cheap and not that good. Worked for YouTube haven’t tried Netflix yet....
2	To small and kinda rolls down
2	I liked the light weight of the wig.
2	No kind of floppy, might work for someone else with another type chair. It was well made, though.
2	Cushioning gone the first week.
2	I really love the design and the way how it looks but I bought it less than a year ago September 2018 and right now it's April 2019 and that's what happened with the screen I'm really disappointed it's slowly dying.
2	Very cheaply made, would have been better off getting them at the dollar store and cannot return them because they are an add-on item.
2	Was not as easy to grow as anticipated... would like to think I have a green thumb with a house full of plants as I do but this wasn’t as great as I thought ..
2	if you like thriller click buy. if you like engaging plot driven narratives with twists and bends, hit purchase. but if youre like me and you need something thats more than a good story told, then dont. gosh it sucks to give two stars! but it's better than none
2	The Nokia started off cool. However, shortly after, the phone refused to work properly. I wasn't receiving my notifications and much more. After only having the Nokia 6 for 5 months, I gave up and now I have the iPhone 8. I tried to use a more affordable phone with the Nokia but I just ended up wasting money! No thank you Nokia!
2	They look cool and fit fine but I feel like I'm stepping on pins and needles when I wear them. Not overly happy
2	You get what you pay for. It works, BUT I have major concern with the kind of metal used in the filter holder. First, the shiny finish disappeared after a few washes. Then, the material that is made of started showing some type of dark corrosion that came off when I tried to wipe it clean. This so to speak, stuff, was dark and had a strange smell. This made me smell the holder at the tip end, and it had a strange smell that I could not figure out what it was. I don't know what kind of metal this holder is made of, but that's enough for me. I will not use this again. I will have to spend the money and get something with a brand name that I can trust. You hear all the time how people have been poisoned over the years by using cheap metal pots. Well, I am not taking any chances.
2	mine didn't work out of the package...i tried brand new batteries from home and still nothing 'every company puts out a Lemon every now and then' sent it back and made a different choice
2	Not doing it for me, 2 stars because it does not upset my stomach
2	Like other reviewers have said, this only seals on edges and is not fingerprint resistant. Returning and trying a different brand.
2	The thing that holds the card is bent and torn so it looks like I regift do!
2	This is one you can put down and the bad guys are a surprise! Some times a good book moves slow but it's still worth reading!!
2	Got my product quickly! The larger side is great, have used it several times, but the smaller roller side - the holder for the small end of the jade roller are spread farther than the jade bead... so it doesn't sit in the holes correctly and doesn't spin. When you reposition it, then it squeaks. Rolls off the track again and you're pulling at your skin if you aren't paying attention. A little disappointed in that side. Edit: Company contacted me and offered me a 20% off coupon on a future purchase. I asked that they just apply it as a refund to this item. They did. 2nd Edit: Company is sending me a new roller. Will review that one once it's received.
2	You get what you pay for! Definitely not Madagascar beans. Disappointed that the size of this package of 10 beans only made 1 cup of vanilla.
2	Broke just shy of a year. The prongs that slide into the vent snapped. Until that though we used it in 2 cars w 2 different phones no issues.
2	They float on water... When purchased I thought they were stone but, they feel & float like plastic...
2	Cheap, Lightweight..have to hold down to use dial. Didn’t work on any plug in thw house.
2	Although the screen does look beautiful, it came in with some dead pixels that gradually got worse over time.
2	Did not have notch for razor even though it was clearly listed as compatible
2	It’s a real pretty cat tree and would have been easy to assemble if one of the pieces wasn’t the wrong size. I gave it two stars because the cats don’t care that the whole tree leans a bit. I put weights at the bottom as well to make it sturdy.
2	Being quiet with nothing to say is VERY tricky if you want it to be good drama. Could have lived without this one.
2	I guess I was underwhelmed with this product, expecting moist, glossy, flowy hair instead of the dry hair I've been having, but I didn't notice much of a difference from my every day grocery store brand...
2	Two pair of the socks were too small to fit on my foot because the band of the sock is extremely small , I wear a 9.5 shoe. One pair ripped once I put it on. The other pair are okay but I will see how they hold up once I wear them a full day.
2	This is my second OTTER Box for my phone. I changed only as I was tired of the black and gray and wanted a color I would see. This one is not very old but it has cracked. I am most unhappy with this event.
2	This is rather a low quality product. I kept it dry religiously, but it split big time in a couple of months. It also bowed out and curved, so I can't cut through veggies all the way.
2	Ordered 6-12 months for my 9 month old boy and couldn't even get it buttoned. Also this was very long. Probably look better on a girl with black leggings. Not typical flannel shirt length.
2	The wallet looks and feels great, but it doesn’t block RFID.
2	I wear a large and this felt like 3XL. The tag said large on it so I don't know if this was a defect.
2	It does not come with the lyrics to the song :/
2	Tarnishes very easily.
2	Underpowered. Sadly dissapointed. Really loud too.
2	I absolutely love this game because it is really fun and addicting but for me it just randomly kicks me out of the game and to my home screen for no reason and then I have to load back into the game.
2	even when following directions perfectly, henna still seems to get stuck in applicator bottles, and it is very difficult to clean out.
2	I don't like how it slips when I wear it. Doesn't support like I would like.
2	Not very fresh and very hard to chew.
2	Seems very flimsy. It doesn't seem like it will protect my toddler's new iPad 6 if she drops it at all!
2	Seller kept in touch. Product was good. Received wrong size. Sent can to seller(not Amazon) ( mistake) , never received refund:(
2	I order this item twice. Both times the product works great for a few weeks and then it stops working. I am very disappointed. I probably going to order from someone else.
2	The pillow is super easy to carry. However, it does not provide the feeling or the support of a real travel pillow. I was better off with the crappy airline pillows because this air pillow provides very little support for the back part of your neck.
2	first uses was not happy that the oil sprayed out in straight stream. Would prefer a spray, not a stream.
2	I ordered most of my lights from Amazon this year and had trouble with all of them. Half of these didn't come on and with some of the lights that colors would not change to color I picked. Most likely will never order these again.
2	The stand is nice but the charging is so slow.
2	I actually feel like this dries out my hair, I would to purchase again and if I could have return the spray I most defiantly would have.
2	As the other reviews stated, the 100' hose collapses when the water is on, the hose and there isn't any water pressure. I tried it with several different nozzles, including one I got with another brands expandable hose and it does not produce enough pressure to use outside of gently watering plants. The way the hose connects to the brass end looks like it won't last very long. We will see.
2	Wanted grey, got white. Idk how it happened after I selected grey, but make sure to double check your order.
2	It works, but not great. The tube isn’t long enough and the suction isn’t very strong (1 9-volt battery). You have to be right on top of the big at the right angle to get it.
2	Shirt is SUPER stretchy & a little more snug than I normally would like. Love the design/print, just not a fan of the material of the shirt.
2	The earbuds only charge while plugged in but the charge box does not work the lights dont come on
2	It doesn’t fit exactly how the picture shows. I guess it might look different on some faces, but when I wear mine the skull from the top jaw looks decent, but the teeth are stretched out across my face. That’s all you see is the teeth stretched out. It just a bit off like your wearing white paint.
2	Very cheap material. Flag ripped in one day..
2	getting a label that is folded doesn't make a lot of sense...
2	HDMI connection does not work. I was hoping to use this one instead of the more expensive version I bought, but no dice.
2	Not as nice as expected. Does not include eyeshadow blending brush or crease brush.
2	Its okay but not great buy something that is more toxic if you want it to really work.
2	Well it was purchased to do solder work on laptop PCB but I could not get it to heat up enough to melt the puddle. It was hot enough to melt solder out of a spool but actual solder joints, nope. Will hold onto it for smaller projects. I like that it is portable and can be powered by a battery bank.
2	easy to clip. not sure how well it will stay. didn’t come with silencer that it said it would.
2	it keeps turning me in the middle of matches on siege and it keeps turning off the controller
2	These are nice quality but my dog is indifferent to them...Not sure why
2	The band is not as pictured....Brim is very large.....This item was delivered in a box much, much to small. The crown was smashed down and the brim curled up all the way around. Extremely disappointing.
2	My main issue with this set is that the tunnels themselves have sharp backs, which makes pushing them through when going up in size painful. I've decided that I won't be using these to get to the size I want.
2	I bought this a few months ago, Easy enough assembly although I did not attach the "leg rest?" to the chair because it does not collapse under the seat, it sticks out a lot to a point where you can put your feet on the floor if you didn't want to use it, so I removed it. The arm rests can rotate 360 degrees but one of the ball bearings inside the arm came out and it was unable to hold it's position anymore, so I took those off too. I don't like arms on my chairs anyway so it didn't bother me much. The most important part is after about a month after using it it starts to develop the most gut wrenching creaking noise when you move the slightest bit while sitting in it which has made me actually very very upset. I could have dealt with the lack of other things, but when the most ungodly screech emanates from it when I move the slightest bit is very disturbing and I'm tired of the neighbors calling the cops for noise complaint every time I try beating my fucking dick
2	Eh. You get what you pay for. They're cheap plastic that easily breaks so just be aware of that when you purchase
2	Too much fuzz comes off and gets on everything
2	Velcro is coming off already, daughter loves the fit but securing shoe is now a challenge.
2	Takes way way way to long to get to us. My husband works 5 hours away from home so I thought it would be a good idea to use this service. When he received the food (he did not tell me before I ordered more) that the food was thawed out and it was not under dry ice. So either it was put with dry ice and it took so long to arrive or it never was not sure. He said the food was thawed but still cool so he gave it a try. I would give 5 stars for the taste so good for y’all, but how long it takes to get to him I am not impressed so 2 stars..
2	I bought one by $ 39.99 and now it is about $35. I was not happy !
2	The color and fit was about right. The stitching along the shoulders and sides was not as good as expected, and was puckered in places. The fabric weight was light.
2	I purchased one of the lights just to see how it worked! It seemed fine so I bought 3 more! A week later I am finding that the connection to the Wi-Fi keeps getting lost and then will not recover. So I have to keep resetting the bulbs and then reconnect them to the internet. This is Not what I was looking for. When the lights work, they are great but so far all they have done is convince me to invest in a Phillips hue system!!
2	I was able to comparison shop after the fact of purchase, and I found much better quality at a local farm store--for a similar price. --Disappointed.
2	The exterior box PERFECT, inside A MESS. Sugar EVERYWHERE(they do not do refunds) Not so CUBED anymore. Waste of my money.
2	The plastic hinge is coming apart now, which is going to happen within a matter of time when bending plastic over and over through the years. That said, it was okay while it lasted but be careful because it has a tendency to pop pills across the room when shutting the individuals plastic lids. For that alone, I would not buy it again.
2	Way too damn long to ship, over two months after I forgot about out.
2	Received a kit for additional displays... Did not receive product ordered, if I did I would be writing something complete different.
2	Too squared fitting, not fitted and the material is rough, looks and feels cheap.
2	I know it says the packages may come in assorted colors or prints but the ones I received were a really ugly print. The material is not a high quality and the fit is just ok. This is the first and will be my last time buying undies online. I got what I ordered; a package of 5 undergarments so I am not totally dissatisfied but I will want to see my undergarments first before next purchase.
2	I bought this about a year ago and the backpack is starting to fall apart.
2	These do NOT work for standard spring-loaded Nerf clips. They are simply too small and pop right out. However, they work great for clip-less Nerf guns. DO NOT buy if you plan on using them in clips!!!
2	Disappointed bag ripped 2 months having it
2	Worked for the first 3 days then one earbud on each set stopped working. You get what you pay for !
2	Two of the six didn’t even work.
2	These don’t provide as much support as I’d like as they fit kind of baggy. I wish I’d sized down.
2	Sherpa part gets rough after washing on hand wash only
2	Very hard to work with. Kept sticking to itself and creasing. Had to throw away.
2	Originally, I thought this light-weight walker was just the thing for my elderly mother, as she has severe neuropathy. She needed a light-weight walker so she could lift it into her car, when she needed to run errands. Within 2 months, it started to fall apart! The right brake stopped working. I am VERY UNHAPPY about this, especially since it was an Amazon choice.
2	Did not like the way this product broke off on me no even within a month of using it. had a small crack til gotten bigger and all fluids leaked.
2	They look great, but I should have probably gotten a half size smaller. Additionally, are these supposed to come with insoles? Because mine didn't.. and they're quite uncomfortable. Pro: They look good. Cons: Very uncomfortable, they don't come with insoles.
2	This book could have been soooooo much better. It was confusing because it just started. It read like cliff notes. Nothing was joined together, not the characters, nor the timeline. If the author would take time a rewrote this book I would reread it. I liked the main characters.
2	These are touted as being FDA approved but I am skeptical. They are taped along the edges which was coming apart after the first use. Not sure I would recommend them. We are using them in a cold smoker but don’t know that I would trust them with any heat.
2	colors are nice but product fell apart completely in one of the colors after 2nd use
2	They work great for holding eggs but the lid does not stay closed so I have to keep it closed with a rubber band. Also, there is no airflow so the eggs will start to grow mold after a couple weeks so I drilled holes in them and it seems to have worked. Personally I wouldn't buy them again or recommend them.
2	Needs replacing within 6mos
2	Great price point headphones i use these all day at work and the battery lasts around 12+ hrs
2	Very small! and bad delivery
2	Bought these for a surprise 13 birthday party but I got the surprise when only 4 of 12 lit up. They were bigger than I expected though
2	These were ok at first. The packaging they came in had a very strong chemical smell but I just washed them and they were fine. But only 3 months later (and these aren’t my only sheets) the fabric is pilling up which makes them scratchy. Very disappointed.
2	It lasted 1 hour with my 7 month old lab. She's more of a destroyer than just a chewer.
2	Nothing I cannot use it.
2	Too pricey and first day a sink hole from the chair appeared and still there
2	The pad split after three uses. It was cooling, but not durable. Returning item.
2	Must’ve gotten an old one, because it broke every time I used it. Barely lasted because of the breaking and product loss.
2	very thin, although very soft, doesnt seem like it will last long
2	I bought this tracker for my son as a Christmas gift. He started wearing in on 25th and really loved it. On 30th, I realized that the face of the tracker had some scratches and he didn't know how it happened. I emailed the seller to inform the issue. In fact, before buying this tracker, I read reviews and found out 1 case, it was scratched and seller exchanged new piece for the customer. The exchange piece was working well since then. That was why I decided to take it and thought defect was just odd. Waiting for them to solve my problem...Will update when I got their final solution
2	Outside has burn marks on it from gas stove. Dulls quickly. And handle gets very hot if you plan on boiling water. Wouldn’t buy again.
2	hat is adorable. however my packaging came ripped apart.
2	I ordered this for my 8 month old. I can't even suck through the straw, so I have no clue as to how she would be able to. Literally no liquid will come out. I have checked the parts and nothing seems blocked. I don't know how any baby/toddler could use this.
2	The chairs are too short for my dining room table.
2	So I bought these headphones about 2 months ago and they were great. The sounded fantastic and I loved the quality of them. Unfortunately now headphones have these random really loud bursts of static whenever I watch or listen to something. Don't know if I can get a replacement but will let you know later if I can.
2	This fit well but was a little on the cheap side. The color of the jersey didn't match, it was more like a maroon. If it's NFL why would it not be the right color?
2	He dosnt stay filled , he leaks. dosnt grow evenly
2	Washed this and lent was everywhere. Wash separately. It was a bad choice buying the gray. Stay with Black. Adidas.
2	Disappointed the plastic cap was missing. Purchased intentionally to travel with.
2	Don’t get this pump if time is important to you. It takes 3x more than medela.
2	I don't know how they can list up to 16 mile range. We just used these for a drive from Florida to Pennsylvania. It probably should say range of 1.6 miles. It definitely did not have over a 2 mile range. If you were close to the other car they worked fine, but honestly anything over a mile was bad or not at all. These did not meet my need for them at all.
2	3 of the magnets seem decent, but one won’t stay on my fridge at all because the magnet is so weak. Very cute magnets, just wish the magnets were stronger. Very pricey for the quality.
2	Box came in horrible condition! Will have to return and buy another from a different seller.
2	Looks: Awesome! Build: Great! Good materials and workmanship. Usability: LIQUID STORAGE: Terrible hot liquid storage. I brew my coffee in the morning and after 8 hours, it is tepid. Sure, it says "keeps hot for 7 hours". But I have a cheaper $10 unit previous to this purchase that would keep it warmer for 8 hours. I expected more from this seeing that it's a bit more pricey. SEALING LID: NICE that it can be disassembled for thorough washing. BAD because Close/Open indicators are hard to read (grayish silver against black). Also hard to see if it is open or close because the movable closing mechanism inside is same color as lid. If you don't have your glasses to read the hard-to-read indicators, you have to make sure to tip it a bit to check if it's closed. GOOD LUCK pouring from this tumbler to another container because liquid dribbles down the side and onto your counter (or shoes). I do not recommend this for hot liquids. Can do cold drinks well if you're looking for one.
2	Great warm and bright light, but they only lasted 1 year.
2	Picture is correct but what came was different. Washer and springs worked. So I was able to repair the Valve.
2	Still trying to get to work with Alexa
2	Only change I noticed was that my pee is VERY yellow... I took this religiously every morning...was hoping that it would help me combat cravings and curb my appetite, but didn't notice that it did that at all.
2	This is canvas material not regulation duck cloth. They are super slick and it makes it hard to play corn hole unless you are an excellent shot and can sink it every time. Otherwise they don’t stay on the board. I’m not sure how I’m going to fix them to be able to use them in a game.
2	Could someone please reach out to me? The hook broke after first use so it no longer can attach to the mirror or hold the fabric up.
2	first couple of days worked great sounded awesome. around the 3rd day there is a skip in the sound every few minutes which is very annoying during your favorite songs.
2	the acrylics are not very good
2	The confetti balloons were the main thing I wanted and they didn't even fly up with the helium in them. The sank down :(. Was so disappointed
2	No effects at all and gave me major constipation
2	This screen protector constantly fogs up. Also, there's a black border around it that blocks just enough of the screen to make some things impossible.
2	Great quality toy but I was bummed because the squeaky does not work. I used it for decoration so it was great for that. But I intended to give it to my dog after and it’s main purpose wasnt fulfilled. I was pretty bummed for the price
2	This is the second puzzle I have ordered from Vermont Christmas Company and both have been missing one piece. What a disappointment! You work so long to finish the puzzle and it is incomplete.
2	Runs really small. Measured to my other Reef's and they are supposed to be same size, but new ones are a significantly shorter!
2	It did not fit my phone or friends phone that was the size it was made for!
2	I like the privacy screen. However, I dislike that it makes it hard to type and the back button does not work with the screen.
2	It gets one more star than the mag wrap. It fits, and I guess it's okay, if you're into that.
2	Didn't like it. Never bothered to finish it.
2	Great concept, but unreasonably cheap construction. The arms broke off of two of the figures as soon as my son got them out of the box.
2	Worked well for about 6 months then started coming apart where the outer casing comes together. Finally after about 11 months the case has enough play that the vac does not get enough suction. Too bad it is made so cheaply would be a great product if it wasn't made to fail so you will have to purchase another. I will go move the vac myself rather than throw money away on this.
2	One was broken upon receipt and the other broke in a few days after I installed it.
2	As other reviewers have already pointed out, the screw heads stripped under the lightest load (see attached pic). The included black screws are actually some cheap, very soft metal (looks like white metal). This is extremely poor quality control, especial for an installation that requires a very high standard for securing the mounting. PYLE rates these speaker mounts up to 110 lbs (from PYLE's website) - I would think this would warrant quality assurances around the type of screw they are including in the installation kit. In the middle of the installation, I had stop, jump in my car and head to the nearest DIY store to hunt down black PAN head screws. Absolutely ridiculous. I would not recommend buying anything from a company with such low quality control standards.
2	Lost screws after a few weeks of use . Emailed support with no response . Waste of money
2	Looks and feels solid. Generic box. Can't use Netflix on it and a couple other apps so I won't be keeping it. . Not happy
2	Battery was die! Seller sent the new one. But navigation system doesn't work correctly. Sad((( too many problem. By the way, the new one battery getting dead after less then a half of year (((
2	Do not get the brown shirt. I have to tell people what it says.
2	Does not fit my cage well, Lovebird is too intimidated to try and too get in, as there is no ladder or anything to help her get into the bath. Must figure out how to get bird to use it. way to big for cage cage, or cage food/water gates, and just too awkward for use. My bird is not tame enough for her to use outside the cage and again, she is scared of it.
2	Not sure what it does. It can’t be felt!
2	Meh. My 8 year old dog was able to chew and break the little pieces off after just 2 days. She's not really an aggressive chewer neither. Pretty disappointed in this product.
2	Image shows a super cute rose gold planner but it doesn’t show the ugly flower design with a statue of jesus on the cover. No space to do weekly meal planning. Good for someone who has a big multi step goal that they are working on. I need something that organizes daily due dates for work and family appointments.
2	Don't recommend. Low quality product. Extremely thick, hard to apply.
2	Not ideal for large chested women. Tape does not hold up advertised “d” cup size.
2	Dislike that fact that there the same length as the stock shocks. There description says for truck's with lift.
2	I previously reviewed the first book in the series, Witching on a Star. That wasn’t a success by any means – I rated it 2,5 stars, and while I had high hopes for a reverse harem set in a witching academy, my hopes fell flat and the book was a bit of a dissapointment. Still, I picked up book two, As You Witch, because I wanted to see if it would get any better. The series has a lot of potential, it just never executes it well, so I thought that maybe some of those kinks would’ve gotten fixed in book two. Alas, no such luck, and I even liked this one less than the first one. This book was filled with unnecessary drama from the start until the end. With a million possible options to pick villains when your book is set in a witching world, the author keeps on using the mean girl as a villain. It’s dull and predictable. The dialogue is so bad that I had to roll my eyes at every other sentence. Max is immature, childish, entitled, and the guys she’s supposedly in love with are so bland and boring even I wouldn’t be able to keep them apart. There is no conflict. There’s nothing really at stake. The relationships are too perfect – these four guys are instantly OK with all of them being with the heroine, and none of them is trying to win her for themselves. Of the four guys, only two have a hint of a personality, and the other two are basically just thrown in so this would be a reverse harem and not a love triangle. Either give them more personality or focus on the two that do have developed personalities and that a reader can root for. Look, I know I’m one of the few who isn’t fond of this series, and it has really high overall ratings on Goodreads and Amazon. So, don’t take my word for it, this is after all just my opinion. But as far as reverse harems go, I’ve seen a lot better than this one.
2	My cat wouldn't touch it. I was hoping because of it being organic. Really hard to bite.
2	It was pretty but was VERY slippery and I don't feel it would provide much protection. I returned it.
2	Used it on stroller..: only lasted 3 days and started to peel off. Would not recommend for stroller
2	After I got my product, found out it has a three year warranty. This coverage starts after that expires. Will the product last that long?
2	This is only one piece. Returned. I needed a back and a seat cover.
2	It lasted 6 months of daily use before finally burning out. The description indicated a 25 watt bulb was included but after opening it to replace it was actually a 15 watt bulb. Very difficult to remove the plastic cover over the bulb without breaking it, ours broke in both corners despite being as careful as possible. Would not purchase again for this reason.
2	The pen was delivered very promptly. That being said the quality of this pen is sub par. Not nearly as well made as the old Parker IM pens. The description also said the pen will be shipped with a black refill. It was shipped with a blue ink, not black. Overall I am disappointed with this product from Parker and the description is incorrect.
2	Thought mom or I would use this because we love their mango scent. Neither of us liked this at all so we didn’t even try it & will gift it to someone else.
2	This charger replacement broke for me just the other day. I've been using it for less than a year. The charging cord also never actually fit all the way into the clip adapter for the watch, making it feel cheeply made.
2	This is good for a desktop and you need it to fit in a small space. If you do not constantly add ice, it will not produce cool air the way an AC unit does. And even still, it is basically just a small fan. Good for bedside white noise or small airflow, not good for cooling a room down. I used for an 8x12 room and it did not cool it down even a little bit.
2	top cloth layer of insole started separating after only one day of use. these insoles are replaceing 6 year old timberland insoles that have not seperated in any way. i dont think these are timberland insoles. probably china knockoffs. bought a pair of felco pruners that were proven to be knockoffs. had to reorder them from felco to get the real deal. i think amazon is slipping. to big to manage??????????????
2	The spine was broken on this book.
2	This clock is not a described in the bullet points. It is just a basic alarm clock. You cannot set it just for weekdays. Disappointed.
2	the handle un-snaps from the main body of the brush very easily while scrubbing, and the green bristles are pretty useless when it comes to cleaning under the rid
2	Don’t waste your time. I read to do a test strip, and I’m so glad I did. I left it on for two hours and this is all it did. It’s just gray, no purple tint at all. I returned the other unopened jar.
2	Good case but did not support phone as a stand.
2	This is horrible! Loading is very clunky. It’s easier and faster to do by hand.
2	Light was very bright after the first charge then started to go very dim after about 2 hours of use then after the second charge it stayed at that disappointing brightness. Wish I could leave a better review expected more after reading through reviews before purchase.
2	It's VERY hard to use the phone because the protective cover is not the best.
2	Really did not work for all the claim
2	Very poor suction. Rigid wand attachment very short.
2	Not worth the cost. Keep looking people !
2	The directions are clear on what to do, but if you follow them, when you go to screw the other side of the step in.. it doesn’t line up well & the screw is “just” long enough. If you ignore the directions and try to put the steps on first, they go together great but then putting the bottom on, it doesn’t line up well. Either way you do it, mine was crooked. (& no it was not from being on unlevel ground because I put it together in my kitchen) We will see how durable and sturdy it is once my child uses it.. not to impressed with this ladder. I brought it, despite all the other reviews because it was the only ladder I could fine that was the same name brand as the trampoline.. Not a huge issue but the ladder in the picture appears silver, the ladder is white.
2	Cheaply made and will ruin the velvet hanger if you try to remove the clips so I highly recommend you keep the clips on the same hangers instead of removing and reusing. I learned this the hard way. These clips damaged many pink velvet hangers by removing the velvet. Also these seem to be very cheaply made as some seem to attach easy to hangers while others are harder to open and difficult to attach (We only have one type of baby hanger: Closet Complete Baby Velvet Hangers, Pink) so its not like one hanger is thicker than another that we are trying to use the clips on. Several clips broke and the clips are pretty bulky. I bought two packs and one of the packs had 38 instead of the 40. Not returnable either.
2	Magnetically Attached Inner Hard PC Shell does not fit my phone. I have a 8 note and its so big my phone falls out of it. So now I have to either order a new case from somewhere else or try to get my money back because I cant find the package. This case would of been perfect if they would of sent me the correct Hard Inner Shell. I was so disappointed.
2	Two of the antistatic bags were already opened. We'll find out if there are any issues when I assemble the parts later this week, since the 2 day delivery on my other parts has turned into 4 days or more.
2	Unfortunately, after just a few stitches, it started to jam and became practically unusable.
2	I ordered it to put in my coffee and tea, but it didn’t have the rose flavour or scent at all, not sure if I was doing it right ....
2	Very bad quality, not sharp, not worth it!
2	I have used bluetooth earpieces over the years, usually leaning towards Motorola or Plantronics. My last Motorola died, so I tried this one based on reviews. I've never used the over-the-ear clips, always relying on the in-the-ear attachment, which has always worked great. Stays in while working out, etc. None of the in-the-ear attachments fit well to ensure a snug fit. I found it difficult to press the button to connect with a call. The object itself is narrow, and fairly dimensional (so not very flush with your head). I'd go to press the button and it would roll, come out of my ear, etc. I purchased 2 (always like having a back-up), but am sending the unopened one back, and will continue my search.
2	I loved the color and soft feel of this rug, but it is definitely not non-skid. I had it on a tile floor and they moved all over the bathroom. Last night my husband slipped and feel on the rug. I'm shopping for something new.
2	Wasn’t too fond of this. I needed something stronger than the basic crew pomade, but this wasn’t a good choice. The smell was fine, the hold was mediocre and was difficult to wash out. Not too happy with, but thank god it’s only $10...
2	Didn't receive the wire cutter with the kit
2	Doesn't seem to scare any of the birds or pests around my house like I'd hoped.
2	Did not work for me as my horse did not like it.
2	You can get equal quality at the dollar store for a lot less. This item ic clearly a second, as even the writing is upside down on it.
2	It has something smeared all over the front of the book. I was given a full refund and it was an easy process.
2	For the price the quality is good. I dont have to buy toilet paper for a while when I buy from GEN. Only complaint I have is that every time I buy the toilet paper case, the box comes to my house very damaged. The packaging needs improvements bad! Every time I get my shipment, the box is taped to prevent the rolls from falling out and I am always missing 1-2 rolls of toilet paper. I have included some pictures for reference and this is how the boxes always arrive....at least to my house every time i order the product. I have even asked to put my order inside another box, and it always arrives just like the picture. Please fix the packaging!!
2	It was great until the seam where the metal wire on one side popped out so soon.
2	Still stuck to phone, but broke. Could use one flat edge on ring. How do I remove it from my phone after the gem amd ring broke off?
2	really can not get the images I wanted, and instructions are not very clear on assembly.
2	Was missing the metal things to stack them, could only stack 2 of the bins
2	EXPECTED BETTER QUALITY FOR THE MONEY....TOP IS OK BUT THE BOTTOMS IS SO THIN YOU SEE YOUR BUTT CRACK
2	Fun for like 2 seconds, but the batteries die QUICK and then we had issues, called their customer service and they were rude and unhelpful. Had to return and getting a new one, probably a different brand because they’re a hassle to deal with
2	The ears don’t stay up. The lay flat on your head.
2	Thermal carafe is horrible when compared to my Cuisinart carafe. I even preheat with boiling water with little effect. Nice to look and a reasonable price point.
2	This laptop stand was quite functional but the plastic used for folding legs is not durable at all. The top left one got broken very easily.
2	The set up is a complicated & difficult process. The table shakes in spite of the tight screws of nuts and bolts. Tried to return but passed the return time frame. The design looks great but if you want to use this table for daily use, I wouldn't suggest it.
2	It’s took forever to 100% charge phone and battery both.
2	This controller’s joysticks squeak and get stuck constantly. I always walk off the edges of cliffs with it :(
2	I must be drinking the wrong beer because any can I put in this thing, the ring won't screw on because it won't fit over the shoulder of the can. So, it's worthless to me.
2	Shipped loose in a bag. Heavy burrs left on cutting edges.
2	The paper quality is good but it’s too pricey for the amount of paper you get.
2	very hard to get a good print with this clay
2	Received ripped. Seams weren’t going to last. Would have been great, but poorly constructed
2	Huge gash opened in slide on third use
2	I noticed another user left a review saying the thumb position is weird. It actually hurts my thumb and the position actually caused my thumb skin to pull back from the nail slightly when using my dominant/right hand.... They seemed like decent gloves and I thought my hand just fit in there differently as if it was my fault but then I read the other review. I will deal with them instead of going through the return process. I just tape my thumb now.
2	Great sound and worked great for about six months. Then had bluetooth connection issues. And after about a year hardware failure and inop dead piece of expensive equipment that would require service / tech repair to work again. Customer service at B&W sucked badly. Their site states 1-2 days to reply. First reply was 5 days. And even then was some link to an FAQ that didn't address my issues. Was a great speaker once.. Now just gathering dust in garage ... Bought a JBL. Hope i have a better go of it.. LOL
2	Tiny. The pieces were so small, I didn't even start it. I just sent it right back.
2	2 stars because while it works as advertised and charges my phone perfectly, the design of the vent clip and ball joint make this overall unit far too heavy to keep your phone from flopping back and forth every time you turn your car. I supposed this could be a fault of the vent louvers themselves but other vent clip phone holders don’t suffer from this problem because they hold the phone unit very close/flush against the vent itself....allowing very little side to side movement. By comparison, this design has the actual charger/phone holder being held out a full 3-4” away from the vent. Good for airflow, but fails to serve the purpose of the unit itself as the phone will just flop back and forth constantly. Very annoying. Not recommended.
2	To small for what i needed bought a different one.
2	Reasonable product but it takes a lot of rinsing to remove it. Theres no scent to speak of, which is good
2	Thinner than I hoped. Not for cold weather.
2	Super cheap and the brissels keep falling off
2	I take papaya enzymes because they really help protein digestion, which dampens down my acid reflux. The fruity flavor is mild and very pleasant - I have to restrain myself or I'd eat them like candy. So, why the 2-star rating? Because I thought I was just buying a bigger jar, only to find out that they are MINT-flavored. Nowhere on the front of the bottle does it indicate the flavor, which it should if it isn't the original fruit flavor. I'm really disappointed with American Health for this. I just wasted $15!
2	The bands look great and my boys love them however after a few weeks the bands started coming off while my kids are wearing them, now they are coming off daily. I thought the quick release would make for an easy install but it’s not with them continually coming off while in use.
2	The chair came with a construction issue, so you can see inthe picture the room for the 2 back legs is not the same therefore one leg has to much room and can not be fixed and the other one does not fit at all.
2	After 2 weeks one light went out already
2	I wanted a vac with good suction. This had so much I couldn;t push it on my carpet. I liked that you could divert the suction to the accessory hose. It is very loud. I had to return it.
2	Didn’t work well with me, it is always very difficult to find the charging spot for either the phone or watch. I stopped using this product one week after I got it. I guess there are better quality products to buy
2	These headphones are not what I was wanting. The most damning aspect of them is that when I have my phone in my pants pocket, they sound cuts off because the bluetooth can't penetrate the fabric of my shorts and reach the headphones. This doesn't necessarily happen when I am indoors and stationary, but when I'm walking down the street for my commute, it happens nearly every time. In that situation, I have to hold the phone in my hand at chest height for the headphones to work properly. The other gripe that I have is that the plastic piece that goes behind the neck is one piece and is too small for me. This causes the headphones to be pulled out at an angle when I wear them. I did report my issue of the connectivity to the seller, and they were very gracious in sending me another pair, but the second pair had the exact same issue. These are not worth purchasing in my opinion unless you plan on using them in a static position with your device nearby.
2	The charger works great with a wall charger, but they are no good when you connect them to your car usb input. It always says check connection with any of my cars usb inputs.
2	These already look faded and worn after first washing. Thin, rough feeling to fabric.
2	Assembly and not too sturdy
2	I guess I bought the wrong flavor, my cat won't eat this at all. She likes the Nutrish Chicken flavor and I guess I'll stick with that on future purchases. Just thought I'd try giving her something different but didn't work out. Now, I have a whole bag of cat food, I guess I'll try to give to a friend.
2	I can't say that this product is worth the price. They do not last long and this was my second set. The first ones I purchase broke almost immediately ..at least in time to be able to replace them. Now shortly after receiving the second set they too have broken. But when I checked to get them replaced the return date has passed. I am not happy with this item at all. On the up side my Grandsons LOVED them while they were working. Too bad they broke so quickly
2	My bunnies love this hay!! Unfortunately, it has a moderate amount of brown unedible hay and a lot of hay dust in the bag. For the price of this product it should be better!!
2	My rabbit ate it in one day
2	The material looks durable, but tore within a few months along the top
2	Cat wouldn't use it. Ball doesn't keep going just rocks after the first go around.
2	Had cut at lock Smith. Key programs and works fine but the keyless entry remote will not program to the vehicle.
2	Shirt is nice and is as expected but the odor that it comes with is so strong it stinks up the room it's in. Even after washing it, the odor still remains.
2	I am not sure if this was a good purchase or not. Thankfully I don't use my laptop for long periods of time, that being said, I can't get more than 2 hours out of a charge. It is longer than the battery it replaced which required being plugged in constantly to function. It was much cheaper than an original, but the original would have given me 6 hours, assuming it is the same as the one it came with many moons ago. It was a bit snug to install, but it fit. It also argued with charging at first, needing babysat while charging to ensure it was being accepted or something. Very often it would say the battery is not compatible, but would do that off and on while charging. I do not remember if I had to do anything unusual to make it charge all the way, but I eventually made it work. So...FYI.
2	item arrived but with no top, I am only glad it didn't ruin the other items in the box, quality control not doing a good job lately!!
2	I wasn't so excited to get this float but I will be returning it. Immediately upon inflating it I discovered a large tear in the stitching. The tear doesn't let air out, but since its along the stitching I can tell it will only get worse. Other than the tear the float is very nice and I'm sure I would have spent many happy pool days in it.
2	Purchased this for my son as he is rough on violins. Took it to get it tuned and the bridge put on just to find out the bridge didn't have spaces for the strings to go and that the violin is a toy not a true violin. I was told that by the time I spent the money to make the violin playable I would have spent more than the $250 the store was charging for one of theirs.
2	The pin to index the blade broke twice, the first one was replaced the second one was returned for a refund. It might be good for light duty but don't expect it to withstand any hard use.
2	My normal charger has more power then this, keep phone cool but it’s doesn’t charge fast. It feels like a good Quality item. -iPhone X-
2	Took almost a week to ship the ETA dates are not accurate at all, they didn't let me know it was going to be late until it was too late to cancel
2	I gave these shoes two stars because they are Skechers and are no doubt a quality product and nice looking shoes. These shoes have a very hard insole. When I first put them on I took them off to see if I accidentally left cardboard or something in them. I decided to give them a try anyway. After putting about 30 miles on them they never got comfortable. I returned them and will probably never buy shoes on line again.
2	The key don't come with transponder chip.
2	The charging part does not work. It has a great design and functionality. No issues except the charging portion doesn’t work no matter what i try.
2	The E-book with installation instructions was missing from the shipment.
2	Well I waited to give this review unfortunately it's a bad one. Keyboard worked great for 5 months then just stopped working completely. Hopefully this thing has a warranty.
2	Fits smaller dint really like the feel of it.
2	The blue charge light went out first day
2	I should've read more before purchasing this item. I specifically bought it for counting steps and the counter for charge 2 is way off. I tried changing setting to my dominant hand and setting my stride. It still gives me way too many. How does one get 200 steps going from the bed to the bathroom and back to bed? This thing picks up every single hand moments as as step. Not helpful when I work on a computer and want it to help remind me to get up and move around. I can see other advantages. It's neat that it tell me I have a text.... But that's not what I bought it for and not how it's advertised/
2	It seem like a great product at a good price. I wasn't to happy when I installed it on my phone. After cleaning the screen, then drying the screen. I applied the screen saver and the adhesive never kept on the screen. It looked like it was warped. Both of my screen protector are trashed. A bad purchase on my part.
2	It came broken and the box was damaged and roughed up.
2	It was ok at first then didnt do very much not very satisfied
2	The filter fits our Vicks humidifier and was convenient to buy from Amazon. But the first of the 2 filters lasted less than a month and was moldy. We keep the humidifier clean, and we've never had a filter that had to be thrown out anywhere nearly this quickly. We saw a humidifier at CVS last week that doesn't use a filter. I think that is what we'll do next. It doesn't make sense to spend $20+ every 2 months to buy these filters.
2	Product peeled off of my nails in 2 days. Went on easy and looked great initially.
2	I must be the only person on the planet who gets heartburn from these peppermints. I love the super strong pepperminty taste but boy, they definitely do not love me back. I think I could actually be allergic, because not only did they turn my stomach, they made my mouth feel scratchy and irritated and weird. Ack! So, the lesson is this: if the first peppermint makes your throat hurt and a few minutes after ingesting it you feel sick to your stomach, chances are the second one will do the same. I tried one when they first arrived, enjoyed it, but felt a bit yucky about 10 minutes afterwards. I tried another one a few days later, thinking the first time must have been a fluke, but it happened again--only worse. Needless to say it was no fluke, and I won't touch them again. I should say I have nothing against the company, Yum Earth. I love their other candies, the fruit lollipops, etc. They're a great outfit making delicious, healthy snacks.
2	Item came in today. Looks like a nice TV. The motion rate is laggy. If someone is walking fast in a movie its blurs. I switched movies and sources. I tried running it through the ps4... It didn't get any better. So water fall in the movie looks like a cloud pouring. I'm not close to impressed. After 10 minutes I started getting a minor headache. I'm boxing it up now.
2	I've been using it for a month now, my eyelashes remain the same. I gave 2 stars because it doesn't hurt the eyes
2	The case looked really nice, and it was very functional. Was impressed with the multiple viewing angles it would provide (as opposed to most other cases that give you 3 or so). Felt the product was a bit expensive, but it did have a premium feel. However within a week, the corner bumpers started gradually falling apart. Not sure if we simply got a dud, or whether the corner bumpers were simply cheaply made, but considering we have never dropped or bumped it against anything, very disappointing that they started falling apart. Now 3 weeks in, the two top bumpers are almost completely gone.
2	It wasn't what I thought it was and it was cheap it come apart for even installed it
2	I received my ipl today..i saw other customers photos and mine is different :/...i'm not sure if is the same product that i paid for. It does'nt have the logo on it neither on the box or in the ipl...i haven't use it yet, but i'm worried about the "brand" they send me...i hope it works...
2	Two iPhone XRs, each in an otter box commuter case and both phone’s screen protectors have chipped around the edges with less than 6 weeks of use. Mine has nicked in 4 places and the wife’s in 2 spots. Will not buy again.
2	They refuse to eat it. I beg them every night to eat their food.
2	Way to expensive for an average black case
2	I like the grip of the handles and their size but they do not stay clamped on my shower wall. As soon as the lock is engaged it pops back up.
2	These lasted a week and a half on my classroom stools. Now I am finding them everywhere. I wish these worked as well as people said they did.
2	I was not able to drive onto them as they frustratingly squirted out from under all four tires at every attempt in my garage. So a jack will be required to lift each corner to position them under the tires. And my current floor jack is not low enough to fit, so to even use them I need to buy a new low-profile jack. It's not worth the extra expense and hassle, so they hang in my garage unused.
2	Great battery life,just not very bright
2	The other accessories are fine except for the actual cup it’s way more yellow than gold then it is in the photo. Pissed me off considering I paid extra for shipping and was really excited for them. Now I have to go buy other ones
2	It is very gentle on your head and works if you get it positioned just right. It's pretty easy to knock it off, though. Could be more snug - my head is not small at all. After wearing one regularly for a month, the inside padding started peeling apart.
2	It was so cute, small and convenient. Simple to use, button for on off. Tap to change colors. Turns off in one hour. We bought this for travel with the kids. It is nice and squishy but sadly it somehow it must have bounced out of our luggage during our travels. We can no longer find this little guy. Perhaps it was a tad too small and round? We did love him the short time that we had to enjoy him though. Update: so I had to buy another one and sadly this one did not work as well. It is too sensitive and keeps turning on, off and switching colors. Today I noticed upon picking up the light that it felt like there was a loose piece and inside and it just past it’s return window :(
2	I ordered this once and it arrived fine. However the second time I ordered it the cap was broken and hairspray had been spilled into the box it shipped in. Very disappointed.
2	One works well the other keeps cutting off
2	bummed out at the condition of the book upon arrival. First delivery had scratches all over the dust jacket. I started a return and had a new book delivered next day. The replacement book had scratched up foil lettering and the dust jacket was bent at the top of the spine. These are supposed to be brand new collector's items... I expected much better condition.
2	Item is too confusing to put on. So I don't wear it much
2	I am 5'10" and a plus size girl. This swimsuit was short in the torso and had absolutely no support for the girls! Had to return suit??
2	These are see through if you bend... at all. If you dont bend, they are perfect for you.
2	The third party seller sent a similar item, but not the exact one I ordered. The one they sent has a purple cap not blue so it's a bit different. I'm going to try it and hope it's okay rather than return.
2	These are just thick flat rubber bands. I couldn’t get them around two couch legs So they didn’t work to hold my sectional together. If your sectional has skinny legs and the legs can touch these will probably work quite well
2	broke me out after every use. probably not for me
2	Bars were not sent in a box. They arrived flattened. Disappointing
2	This filter is too restrictive, and induced a slightly rich fuel/air mixture condition on my Civic - like I have a dirty filter. I chased my tail for months trying to remedy the problem - replacing sensors, using hotter spark plugs, fuel additives, etc. Went back to using a Honda OEM air filter, and the spark plugs went from a sooty black to a recommended brownish color again. The filter is well constructed, but does not provide enough flow.
2	I returned these since the quality/softness of the material is different than what I have bought at the Carter's store.
2	This watch is impossibly heavy as the watch itself is VERY thick. I bought it for a friend and was embarrassed to give it to her
2	Hard to open, hard to fold up small enough to get back into the case. It has a flimsy feel.
2	Came broken with half of the product spilled out. Padding seemed adequate but somehow it still came broken almost as if it was originally shipped that way.
2	I’ve had this headphone case for nearly 4 days and the outer shell has already been damaged too many times. I’ve dropped it twice and it’s caused all this damage. It’s appealing to the eye but not able to take any hits.
2	Defective. The pin page doesn't come up. Called Amazon tech support who walked me through the troubleshooting process like it was my first time looking at a computer. Was really unhelpful and I'm not even sure he was listening. Then, I was referred to ASUS technical support only to connect with another equally inept male technician who insulted me further, and so I'm returning the product after hours online, troubleshooting and dealing with horrible tech reps from amazon and asus. It's a defective pc, the one I received.
2	After going through all the reviews, I bought this two-piece. Ordered a L size. The fit is perfect. I wore it just for a day and threads started coming out of the shorts. Did anyone else face the same problem? Attaching a couple of photos.
2	Works ok won't fit many of my hand guns, not to tight
2	Mine has a hole right in the middle of the sponge in two weeks although I handled it with great care.
2	CANNOT REMOVE KEY WHEN LOCK IS OPEN.....CANNOT ACCESS MORE THAN ONE COMPARTMENT WITH ONE KEY UNLESS LOCK EACH AFTER OPENNED.
2	I can’t find a contact seller on here. The case was working perfectly fine until today. It’s fully charged but it won’t charge my phone at all. All the circles light up, showing that it’s full but than it just all go away.
2	Received 2 one is working the other one LCD is blank not working.The one that is working does not always turn off, but turns on ok.
2	Not for women with curves. The bottom creates a weird crease. Makes butt look funny
2	Not worth the price. Fabric is a weird felt (the texture is odd and feels very cheap). The side pockets are useless and maybe hold 1 diaper. I got it because of the size, but I wouldn't recommend or buy again.
2	Had high expectations, but it fell flat for me
2	not as expected as this is not really solving its purpose
2	I purchased 2 of these units. One to use with salt that I have no issues with and another for pepper which I've determined is unusable. I put fresh batteries in the unit but the thing refuses to crush the pepper beyond a piece or two before jamming and ceasing to grind. I then have to unclog it and hope that it works. I've tried replacing the batteries thinking maybe I had a bad set but it is no use. I'm not sure if I just got a defective unit or it's just not strong enough motor.
2	The style is ok but poorly made. The bracket is not 90 degrees. I bought three sets and had to add an 1/8" shim to two of them to make the shelf level.
2	These cables don't stay snug in the port and can disconnect very easily. Decent lightweight construction.
2	Doesnt work good at all. Will not buy again.
2	A bit too soft. Worst thing was it made her head dripping wet with sweat after only laying on it for a short time.
2	Pros: Sound is really good. Cons: The instructions are horrid. The app is fine until you realize it is a nightmare. I replaced my modem and this turned into a nightmare for this damned speaker. I tried to add my M3 as a new speaker only for the app to say that line of speakers isn't supported. For the sake of the help for others, if you have a speaker set up and replace a router, here is the fix: Delete the app, do a hard reset of the speaker (nowhere in any documentation is this mentioned)- do this by pushing and holding the cog icon button by the power input on the back reinstall the start the speaker, reinstall the app and start from scratch. If you have a blip in power/internet this thing has to be hard reset, it isn't able to reconnect or attempt to reconnect, so it just makes an annoying chiming sound instead. Then you have to unplug it and replug it in. Somehow it cripples my Echo Dot. Whenever connected either directly with a 3.5mm jack or over the network, it disables the speaker no matter what I have the audio set to. This is advertised as an Alexa/Echo compatible speaker. It isn't . Lastly is that it has no battery. I know it didn't when I bought it, but because everything about this speaker sucks other than sound quality, I feel that this is a pretty shitty oversight. Seriously, if the sound quality were even slightly worse this thing would get a 1 star review. It is a shit network speaker.
2	advertised as one thing, hard to see it as such, the individual pieces are stale and old, most definitely not fresh product
2	When it flips over nine out of ten flips do not function pup falls to its side. This one I received does not bark or make any sound as advertised
2	The thing I dislike most about this is the post is immovable. You push the whole strainer down and then there's no way to pull it up slightly for water to drain when done. You have to remove the whole unit or it gets sucked down and plugs the hole again. How can it be called a strainer if it doesn't strain? It should just be called a drain plug because that's all it's good for.
2	Love so many things about this Kimono; the color, the size and the print, however, after wearing it once the inner tie is almost completely unraveled. I'm not tying it so tight that I'm putting strain on the fabric. The hemline is also very loosely sewn. I'm disappointed in the quality for the price.
2	It wasn’t bad to set up but they are stupid liars cause it doesn’t work with Apple HomeKit.
2	This cookbook is not easy to use. It’s set up by the week instead of by subject. If you want a soup, you have to look through the index, then flip through the book to see what you want to make. Recipes looked good, but I would never use it because it was very user unfriendly. I returned it.
2	Stopped filing well after only a few uses.
2	I can say like this, I didn’t like it, because first I wanted like purée, this one just syrup. Another thing taste, I didn’t like it, why I didn’t like cause to sweet. I wanted taste like real passion fruit, it must be kind of acidic. But this one more seeet add a lot of sugar. If u will use for cocktail or tea. It will be good, but I didn’t like cause too sweet.
2	I was looking for a fashion sneaker for the fall and winter without snow this shoe was advertised as one but.. Its not it is a very nice boat shoe one you can not wear with socks if you order your true size. I'll keep them for Summer but now I need to find a shoe for fall.
2	After several months I find no difference.
2	confusing to use, I don't really trust its results
2	I really wanted to like this projector but unfortunately I could never get the right colors or contrast out of it. I'm gonna sell it.
2	Haven't seen one bug in the tray yet...
2	This bag is ok but the Velcro closure came off during the first use. It’s not glued but sewn in and I can’t sew it back without the thread showing on outside. Inside is spacious and insulation is just ok but the front pocket is kind of useless now and this was why I bought it.
2	I followed the directions exactly, including waiting overnight to use it after applying, and was pretty happy with it for a while -- it was easy enough to apply and no bubbles. Strangely enough, after a couple weeks it started feeling soft and rubbery, and my fingernails left indentations everywhere. I still kept it on though. A couple months later it randomly came off completely while it was in my purse, which was odd because it wasn't lifting at the edges or anything. Never experienced that from a screen protector before.
2	It wasn't that bad, but it's nothing special.
2	Inside zipper broke in 2 wks of me purchasing
2	Hardly any fragrance from great quality oils.
2	I love the bag, but I have not even had it 2 months. All I carry in it is my planner and my iPad and the strap is already ripping and fraying off. I wish I knew how to contact them to see if they will replace it.
2	Not a bad product, I suppose. Expect damage during shipping. At this price and how it arrived, one would be better off using aluminum foil!
2	The magnetic system does not hold the phone to well. It just falls apart when dropped. The clips around the phone are barely large enough to provide decent protection to your phone. So I’m having to be extra careful with my phone.
2	Bag is good. The zippers are the issue. The side zipper failed the first day Main zipper gets jammed often. Real pain to fix it.
2	good service product does not work
2	I also bought one of these for my new IPhone and while it does look nice, this bumper offers little protection. For the case to work properly it needs to fit tight, this bumper comes off very easy. Matter of fact it can come off just by pulling out of my back pocket. Anyway I dropped my phone from about waist high and the phone's back chipped. Be warned!
2	There was no basket with this item
2	I would love to give more stars but the black ink doesn't work. The color works fine, but my printer keeps saying there is something wrong with the black cartridge. It won't let me print with it in. I actually had to put my old empty black cartridge back in, in order to print at all.
2	2 1/2 stars. Spray patterns work fine. Does not shut off water completely when handle is released, so it dribbles until you turn the source water off. Seems flimsy.
2	did not work with present system. Ended up replacing the entire repeater.
2	Did't do what it advertises
2	My 8 month lab destroyed this toy in less than a week. Highly disappointed!
2	Unfortunately I would not recommend this product. I have only been using it a little over a month and it already broke. The zippers are very flimsy and the should strap is just as bad.
2	Very dissatisfied with this delivery. The creamer was delivered damaged. I had to sort through the creamer to select the good ones. Brenda.
2	Don't be deceived by the picture on this page as the utility tool is not included. I ordered this item expecting 4 pads and one utility tool. When I only got the 4 pads, I called Amazon who apologized and said that I can reorder and this individual was going to call the distributor to make sure that the utility tool was included. I was told to keep the pads and reorder. Guess what!!! I got the second order with only the pads. Ca;;ed Amazon again who graciously gave me the pads without charging me. I explained that this picture needs to be changed. The Amazon rep agreed with me and told me he would take care of it. As of a month from the time I spoke to a rep, the picture on this page is still incorrect. Buyer beware - this item only includes the 4 pads. I just reviewed some other negative reviews on this item and looks like I was not the only person who ordered this item expecting the pads AND the utility tool. Shame on me for not reading the reviews. I will be more careful in the future.
2	Purchased the "Wine" colored option - did not read the reviews beforehand (my mistake). The color was covered by gold glitter and red patches all over; definitely not leather, not even fake leather, moreso a low-cost fabric material covering. Not what I was expecting and made it look very cheap. Gave 2 stars since I did like how the inside of the portfolio was set up. Overall not a fan and ended up returning.
2	These charging cords did not last me more than two months. They keep going on and off with charging and I had to keep an eye on them to make sure they were working. Would NOT recommend.
2	This was not for me. My hair is very thin. You need to have thick hair to be able to support the weight of this hair piece. I was hoping to find something to put over my ponytail to give the illusion of more hair. There were only two combs to hold the hair piece in place. They just slipped right out of my hair. It was also bigger than it looked in the photos. It covered the entire back of my head, which again made me realize that I needed a lot of hair to attach it to.
2	If I had to sum up my experience in one sentence, it's that this mouse requires a lot more work than other mouse. Tracking is not as precise as others, I had to slow down my movements to make sure I'm actually clicking the places that I want to click, and it's a LOT of work. I really like the design and the concept, but it sucks as a mouse. Great novelty product, terrible mouse.
2	It says 320 but the package that I got is 140
2	They are not comfortable at all. I have many vionic shoes. Theses are not of the same quality
2	This product can barely work on the lawn. It can move over the smallest of bumps. It works only on smooth surfaces
2	This is exactly what I wanted to corral the mess on my desk but one drawer needs sanding down. It sticks and will not open all the way.
2	When other reviewers note the short battery life, they're not kidding. There's barely enough juice to blow the leaves off a small porch before recharging. Nice package, but it needs a real battery.
2	I thought the dolls and clothing would be a hard plastic.
2	The shoe does not look like the actual photo and I am a size 8 and it fits pretty tight...
2	Returned. Didn't work.
2	Was guaranteed by Wednesday and didn’t deliver until two days later. My family came in town for Thanksgiving and slept on the floor. When it finally did arrive, it’s hard and doesn’t really fold for a futon. It’s only good for a flatbed
2	Our grandson loved this but it broke after 20 minutes of playing. The plastic part on top can loose and leg fell off.
2	This product has the pink tint removed which is the main ingredient to tighten under eyes. Very disappointed. I will start looking at other products. This is the 3 red time this has happened.
2	Doesn’t smell like lavender at all...
2	This was on top of a list of great mascaras.... Not for me!
2	Stopped charging after only a couple of uses.
2	The bag of salt broke open inside the brown Amazon shipping box. We saved some of the salt so I'm not requesting a refund but wanted to point out that it wasn't a perfect delivery
2	It has an off-putting chemical smell. It also irritates my skin, making it go red and blotchy as soon as I put it on. It also feels like its burning to the point where I just threw it out and bought a different bottle of lotion altogether. I would not buy this again.
2	Great cup, quality control must be bad as lid does not fit snugly like the other one I received and the lid leaks when in closed position.
2	This is a set of three pens. One works great. One works when it feels like it, and one doesn't write at all. Save your money!
2	After some time (1 year plus) it dies after about 20 mins
2	Fits the V50 perfectly, love the kickstand. The inner plastic cracks really easy, won't survive a 4 foot fall without cracking. In the picture there's a crack in 3 corners. Phone will remain in good condition but I will say not sure for how long. Wouldn't recommend this case. Edit-Replacement has been received thanks to being under warranty.
2	We purchased two of these Game solar disco lights back in June 2018 for use in our in-ground pool. They worked as described for at least two months. They float around in the pool all day. Then they both developed hair line cracks, took on water and the lights quit working. No way to contact manufacturer so out $45.
2	I only received one Thomas coloring book, with only two sticker sheets for a total of maybe 30 stickers (only 15 unique ones, the two sheets were identical). Instead of the other Thomas book and stickers I was sent a random Daniel Tiger coloring book and Daniel Tiger story book, which is not what I ordered.
2	These are junk. Don't waste your money. Very, Very disappointed.
2	Do not have good pins that lock in place.
2	what i go was was to short I am 5'6 with and they hit me at the top of my pants. I would like for them for come down a little longer than that.. and I have not washed them yet,
2	Description said it will open a PS4 controller, did not match, have to return
2	Pretty chain but mine broke very easily
2	Too short for my door. Couldn't even use it.
2	I received this case with stains on the bottom portion of the case. Stains? On a new case? It appears to be used and scuffed along the back. I first contacted the seller, Caseology, and that was useless. The seller requested photos which I happily sent and then told me to just return it to amazon. All i wanted was an exchange with the same phone in new condition. Not stained and scuffed when i pull it out of the box. Amazon you really dropped the ball on this one. And Caseology, I expected actual customer service not a generic email passing the buck. I give tne case 2 stats because I woyld like it but Amazon let me down and I refuse to pay for a used item marked as new.
2	Comes with two cables and outlet dock has 3 slots. It takes forever (~4 hours) to fully charge an iPad Pro 12.9 3rd generation which is pretty ridiculous. Additionally there’s a lag between the time you plug in the charger to a device and when it starts charging.
2	Cute, but doesn't hold up to water or heat well
2	Not great for bigger feet/high arches. Couldn't get it past my heel/top of foot
2	The last two orders came with the new style of diapers. We hate them. We never had leaks with the thicker diapers. My daughter's diaper leaks several times a week with this new version.
2	The watch's bezel is a bit loose and wobbly, which cause contact noise when I move my hand. Makes it feels cheap or damaged. I'm disappointed with this as this is not the quality i expected from Stuhrling.
2	This tape, I wanted to love it, I mean it is so pretty with all the sparkles and metallic colors in a fairly large variety, but alas it is a pile of frustration! Pros: -It is decently adhesive, I am only using in in journaling so it is not like I am really putting this tape through its paces, but it sticks to paper -Really pretty! -Nice Variety, even if mine were different from the tapes pictured Cons: -Poorly cut and very jagged messy edges -certain tapes have the coloring come off and leave giant transparent splotches, this was especially frustrating with my favorite snowflake pattern -at least one of the rolls switches patterns mid roll meaning I had an incomplete project. Overall they are very cheap in appearance when off the roll, which is rather sad.
2	Work fine up until March 30th after the warranty ran out one of the speakers quit working
2	Detail is very light in color, looks like it's been thru the dishwasher multiple times.
2	Fun gun, but outdated. You can't easily or quickly change out the spring of you want to go to airsoft venues. It does creak, and when my son dropped one the upper and lower receiver cracked. I was able to fix it with good electrical tape, and that fixed a lot. Tightened it up reduces jamming, improved accuracy, made it quieter, and breaks up the profile (I used brown, green, and gray tape). But in the airsoft and race, this may just not cut it. Just have fun and don't take it too seriously. UPDATE: I've been playing this recently, and they're crap. It shoots totally random, no precision at all. Good for indoor arenas, where range is not an issue, but don't get the carbine version for outdoors. Especially the gen 1.
2	The grey one ripped on the the first use. Just putting it on the mattress normally made it fall apart. The white one has lasted 3 uses. I wouldn't recommend them.
2	3 of my 6 bottles were damaged upon receiving. Like I picked up the box and could hear pieces moving damaged. They aren't just broken they are shattered. The 3 that aren't decimated are beautiful and seem to work nicely, but still I'm beyond disappointed
2	This book has really well done drawings, but those drawings are rather trippy to say the least. In terms of writing there's no connection from page to page, stanza to stanza, or paragraph to paragraph. Any rhyming attempts are poorly completed. It's a chore to read this book. Definitely not for kids, or even most adults.
2	It didn't fit my HP laptop
2	I ordered a 4 pack, they sent a 2-pack. Just be careful.
2	after all was said and done, the fuse was defective and the fuse holding block broke easily upon disassembly when I went to measure with a multimeter. Wire is of acceptable quality for the price, however I wouldnt recommend using any of the provided connection terminals. Length was just long enough for my mustang, so dont expect much for an SUV or full size truck unless your battery is in the back.
2	only half full and melty looking not effective
2	The bottom of the ring was all bent. It was okay - not in as pristine a condition I would have expected...
2	I bought this for my son ‘s birthday but it’s too small for him and the window to return/exchange is closed.
2	This is a long read that would benefit from losing some of the overly long descriptions and unnecessary subplots. The book does work at sentence and paragraph level, and some of the ideas are very good. But at the end of the day, I hit the halfway stage and went 'enough'!
2	There are better products out there. Squeaks the whole time, and doesn't cancel out noise in a noisy environment
2	Got a run instantly. Not as durable as they used to be.
2	I never got it - apparently lost in transportation
2	cheap material. putting them on the very first time I ripped a whole in the toe space.
2	After finishing part 2 of this 3 part book series, I have to admit that I will not be reading book three... even though I already paid for it. (Which is a shame bc this "series" is nothing more than one book randomly chopped into three parts, so they can charge a bit more, and so I will never see how it ends. Although I don't need to read it to know- it's THAT predictable. Like in your face obvious what is coming. And it's stupid.... kinda like the main heroine.) Did I mention that, although the h is supposed to be an intelligent Harvard grad who does well at her job, she reacts to everything like a twit and her internal dialogue is filled with thoughts that make her TSTL. And at the first sign of romance, she suddenly can't manage her work ethic anymore. But it wasn't allll bad. The plot and tempo of the books may have been crap, and I may have wanted to strangle the vapid and hypocritical main heroine.... but, The main Hero seemed well developed, and the smut scenes were hot. So I gave it two stars for good guy and bed scenes- which were nice, but not enough to make me read the final book in the series.
2	I ordered this 2x larger than I normally would. I was hoping for something oversized and cozy. Instead, I got a crop top. It’s honestly still really cute and I do wear the sweater as a crop top, it’s just not what I expected. Order your size accordingly. It also feels like a cheap sweater but it’s not uncomfortable at all, it’s just the quality you paid for!
2	Reel causes flat / chewed up places in my line. Gets worse with use. Does not cast well, and gets worse as line condition deteriorates.
2	They are very cute but will not stand up once you put something in them. I really question if the company tested them at all. Very disappointing
2	This movie could NOT pull it off. It not worth the time. Story was promising, solid cast, but then the weird choppy editing style. Even Melissa McCarthy couldn't pull this movie out of its nosedive.
2	Bought it 3 months ago, handler gets sticky - need to wash my hands every time I use it - would like a replacement, cannot find vendor contact
2	it didn't improve my hairfall problem at all ..
2	Very cheap looking, not wide enough for Tahoe 2nd row. Attracts dirt
2	This is how I received my rental.
2	Didn't really work for any of the issues my dog was going through. I feel like it was overpriced and didn't last that long. I won't be purchasing again.
2	I had a lot of trouble putting the screen protector on without bubbles underneath... I dropped my phone 2 days later and not only did the screen shatter but the screen saver shattered! And that point it was impossible to use because I was dealing with the cracks in the glass protector as well as the cracks to the original screen
2	The ear pad fell off.
2	My bed a tear while I got it was disappointed and also I lost the screws for the bed and the couldn’t help out since I’m a big shopper of amazon. I moved half way of the country and spend lots of money to bring my bed
2	The switch malfunctions so you have to hold it down to keep it on. The charging base works great.
2	Had been working ok for a bit more than a year then just stopped working
2	Thw foil was hard to use
2	Very nicely done art work. But, card stock is extremely thin. I've used about 1/4 of the box. What's left continues to curl very badly.
2	I was pretty disappointed. I paid almost $40 for 2 of these and they are super small in size. The screen is extremely tiny. Cheaply made. Not too happy as these were xmas gifts.
2	Straighten but will break your hair. Does not get close enough.
2	Well I picked up the second book because I thought maybe it would be better than the first. But it wasn't. So much worse. I am uninterested in the majority of the characters except the ones that get killed off. I particularly find the main character to be a smarmy ass.
2	to small. I had to ask someone to try to put it on for me. it is otherwise a great buy if it fits.
2	Very cute for the first time or two but will erode in the water. I was at the beach so I'm sure saltwater didn't help. Delicate clasp.
2	I put it on the tree and noticed a 10' separation between the 2 pieces. I feel this product isn't acceptable for covering a tree. I previously gave this product a great review before I attempted to actually use it. The birds will love it.
2	Very thin. Doesn't feel like it will hold up to several uses and washes.
2	Was not to pleased to find out this product is not actually a rapid charger. Was expecting a lightning charger. It is a plain charger. Not a lightning or rapid charger as I expected. Just a plain wall adapter
2	The photography is excellent. The coverage of the subject matter is complete. That being said, most of the content in the book is redundant merely re-describing the process of turning and assembling pens. The hook for me was the cover. The beautiful pens displayed on the cover are great examples of what custom turned pens could be. I was expecting a great deal more on the processes for making these artistic things of beauty. There was proportionately very little in the way of describing processes in making the humble pen a thing of beauty. If you've never turned and assembled a pen this book would be OK. If you've made a few pens, you will not find this book to be of much value.
2	This is hardly self start. I'd rather suck out my dirty aquarium water through a straw. To get this going you literally do have to suck it like a straw to start it. So self start is not an accurate description
2	Its ridiculously small
2	I liked the coat fine but it was my own fault for now ordering a larger size then what I am. I'm a solid M and I'm not sure a large would have been comfortable. Hard to tell. I returned it. I think if you have the right size the coat would be awesome.
2	This product is obviously not designed by a player. The webbing between the thumb and index finger is completely unnecessary and uncomfortable. I removed it immediately with scissors. The product could’ve easily been shipped in an envelope costing 75% less than the shipping I was charged as it came in a box big enough for 500 pcs of this item. Overall, poorly designed, too expensive, not effective.
2	They clog easily and my chickens still haven’t learned how to use them to get the water.
2	Okay product. My copies come out a little light.
2	The case is good for the $ but the major drawback is that you can’t conduct calls with the case on- people can’t or barely hear you. For that reason I’m returning this case.
2	Nice sheet set. Would have given 5 stars. But after washing before using noticed that there is a rip and a hole in them. Very disappointed.
2	I clearly purchased brown and black was delivered.
2	These knives are the perfect size, but they are only sharp on one side. They’re too dull to cut anything other than strawberries and bananas.
2	Low cost and you can tell. The lines from page to page are not uniform, but that isn't a big issue for me. What is a issue is the inability to tear the pages cleanly. Very annoying, and a deal breaker. I will not be reordering due to that issue alone. Everything else is good. Writes smoothly.
2	It does not fit the sides on the phone and it isn't private either. It's really a huge waste of money.
2	Okay movie, but kind of predictable. It's basically watching someone watch a movie.
2	Haven’t lost power so I don’t know if they work, but not much brighter than a nightlight. Needs to be in a lamp that isn’t normally in use.
2	Lovely calendar and wonderful photographs, but Amazon apparently doesn't know how to pack and ship a calendar. The hard cardboard in the middle of the calendar doesn't extend to the edges, so the calendar gets smashed because they ship it in a soft enveloped. This happened not only to the original calendar I ordered but to its replacement!
2	The installation was easy, but my camera is no longer in focus after installing the replacement glass.
2	To small for most pens, not sure what these are for. Bought as gift for somebody who simply cannot use them for pens as the stock is too small.
2	Not tight around the face.
2	This Bible is not in chronological order. I know that the Bible does not go from Genesis to Chronicles.
2	Can't use it outdoors at all due to sun interfering with infrared control. Seemed hard to control indoors due to lack of stability -- took a lot of focus to just keep it steady in the air and then make it fly directionally without hitting walls, ceiling, furniture. Ran out of battery charge in about 10-15 mins, and charging isn't very fast. Having said all that, my boys (ages 6 and 4) were still having fun with it. Until it wouldn't work any more. At first the remote worked only intermittently. Then one of the rotors stopped rotating entirely. Had to send it back for refund.
2	I installed this in the drivers side of my truck about a year ago. It was weak from day 1. Fully broke about a year later. Spend the extra and get metal.
2	I ordered two of these cameras for my home. One of them came with a AC adapter without holes in the prongs, so it wouldn't charge. The other camera worked for the most part, but the motion sensor would not function. The instructions are written in poorly translated English, and the app they want you to download is as well (some of the buttons were even written in Chinese). The WiFi connection between my phone and the camera kept resetting, so I had to keep deleting the camera feed and re-adding it. I returned both cameras, there were too many problems to make it worth the price.
2	Very poorly made didn't even have it for a week and it cracked and ripped i mean when it arrived a little bit of it was already ripping. Not slow rising at all it pops back much quicker then expected.
2	Lost a some within a few days.
2	Wish it extended down further. Suction cups don’t stick. I still use it but if I could go back, I’d keep looking.
2	Total waste of money. My cat refused to engage with this toy. It was worth a try, but definitely not for my girl. It seemed a bit heavy for her to be bothered playing with it. She'd rather play with her toy mice and then go eat some hard food. Oh well.
2	the pawls from the dog came broken.
2	OK. I am officially done buying cheap garden hoses. Seriously. This thing burst in 32 days. Yes, I left the hose spigot on, but we didn't even break 90 degrees a single day during the month that I had this hose. It burst and was useless in literally 32 days. Amazon, thankfully, accepted my exchange on this hose, even though it was outside of the return window. But now, I am about 15 days into my second hose, and I just can't take the kinks! Literally kinks just by pulling it out. I am returning this hose and buying a hose that is more than twice the price of this one - and 30' shorter! Hoping that 'more money' doesn't equal 'more problems' in this scenario. I, for one, am completely done buying these multi-ply hoses. I am going to invest more in heavy duty, all rubber hoses, and hope that they last longer than a month! Any hose brand that claims "never kink" - either in the product title or product description, is a liar - and most likely, their hose kinks worse than any hose you've ever owned! Who would have thought that I would start critiquing garden hoses! I guess they are right - your interests change greatly as you age.
2	Much harder than expected and did not blend easily
2	Love the item but paper thin and easily crushed.
2	receive only 2 lights out of 5
2	Use for on trip on the way out shell scratched badly then on second leg of trip bottom corner was smashed in making on oh the wheels inoperable. My last suitcase lasted twelve years with out half this much damage
2	Followed the directions to the exact and had very minimal peeling. I tried it twice in a month span just in case and still almost nothing to peel and trust me my feet have plenty that should have peeled off. I won't but this product again.
2	"One size fits most" didn't fit me.
2	The strap teared out when lifting a moderate load of dry clothes. The stitching need to be much stronger for this bag size.
2	The grinder functions fine. However, it looks nothing like the picture. The mandala is a sticker and it is not placed well, it is pretty far off center. This was supposed to be a gift. I am returning it.
2	Sturdy and has a soft light for reading while not illuminating the entire room. The on-off and control switch knocked my rating down to a 2 that otherwise would have been a 5. I have to tap several times to turn off and on, very annoying if you're sleepy and just want to relax. Wish it was just a button or switch instead of a tap on flat surface that has a mind of its own whether it wants to cooperate or not.
2	The books arrived, but the case was already destroyed when it arrived. Disappointing.
2	Smaller than expected (which is my fault for not measuring by description). Item arrived fairly quickly considering where it came from. Item was bent
2	Bracelet broke after a week.stones don't stay in.
2	It actually works well. I just wish it had better quality. The little plate for the switch came off and broke after the first time I turned it on. Now, I have to use a pen or something pointy to turn it on/off. I could’ve returned it but I was too busy.
2	I ordered this with the hope of being able to connect my surface pro to a tv, which I was able to achieve for a short period of time. After a few months of use I started having a flashing black bar on the left side of my screen that was only present when I had the cable plugged in. I am sad to say that despite the great price, if you are hoping to use the cable multiple times, it is worth it to spend a little more on a nicer cable.
2	The top of the sweater fits very snug....I am very small chested so it doesn’t happen often! The pleats on the bottom laid weird..maybe because the top was snug...I returned the product.
2	Disappointed in this product. Bought it mainly for the case and the headphone covers and the headphones don’t even fit in the case with the covers on. I have to take them off every time I need to charge them which kind of defeats the purpose. Should say that AirPods will not fit in charging case when headphone covers are on
2	Did not last long. It was a good lesson for my daughter (she picked them) about getting what you pay for. One bud stopped working after a couple weeks.
2	Not sure why people give such a high rating. The book lacks planning advise and sample itineraries, just wordy descriptions about all sites. How am I supposed to know how long each place takes to visit given a relatively tight schedule? Not good for first-time visitors.
2	This was annihilated with one gust of wind. One of the corners was missing a loop and had to be tied to the tie down.
2	If you have time to spend doing this for like 3 hours for each full leg buy it if not don't waste your money
2	I purchased this watch for the HR monitor and GPS specifically. Well, I got the GPS to work twice before a run outside. After that it does not connect and all I get is “wait ‘. I went on Garmin website which is not helpful at all. The Garmin connect app is not that user friendly for a non- techy. So frustrating. I really was excited for this watch. Major let down.
2	Faded the first time I wore them but they are very beautiful and sturdy I’m going to buy something to keep it from fading more there not very big but I like the size
2	It was supposed to be new came with no packing slip and dirty cover
2	Wrong color! It says medium beige but it was more orange than normal.
2	I had measured myself and bought these to help with the chafing between my thighs for my upcoming vacation The black lace one fit perfectly but this brown one was too big and I am constantly fidgeting with it because it keeps falling down.
2	Well Product is great. However strawberry flavor felt like a cough syrup.
2	Figurine has a chip taken out of the hair.
2	Perfect size for little toddler hands. Our little one was so excited to get it and took pictures everywhere. Only downside was the battery doesn’t last very long so you have to constantly charge it. Like it lasts about two hours and then stops working again
2	This was a really nice looking band and I was entirely happy with it, except it wouldn't stay clasped shut. When I first got it, it was fine. After a couple weeks, it became hard to click it shut, until I figured out to push the buttons on the side in just a bit when trying to close it. A few weeks after that, it opened and shut fine. After a few more weeks, it started occasionally popping open. I tried adding a link to wear it looser or taking one out to wear it tighter and it happened either way. I wore it like that for a couple years, with it popping open once or twice a day. Since it is still a loop, even open, losing it wasn't an issue. Finally it started popping open 5-10 times a day and I'd had enough and replaced it. Aside from the clasp, though, it was nice looking and looked brand new the whole time.
2	May work for some but not for our cats.
2	Didn’t fit my 3 yr old and now my 1 yr old wears them.
2	Like: a great weed killer. Disliked: took a week to arrive.
2	The absolute perfect size to hold in your hands. Unfortunately I felt the magnification was week. I also thought the light switch not made very well.
2	This is very SOFT and not what I would consider as memory foam- There's almost NO support. Its very light, and you immediately sink down to the mattress or surface underneath... I've purchased the same topper from the same company about 3 years ago and it was amazing, it finally started to lose some support, so we decided to buy a new one, this one is nothing like the last. I'm pretty disappointed. It's been 3 months, and it's almost like there's no topper on my mattress at all...
2	Super cute necklaces- BUT started falling apart as soon as I was taking them out of the packages. Luckily I rigged some peices back together and can still wear them
2	I would not buy it again.
2	Bought this kit to replace the keyboard on my old 2010 Macbook Pro, reached for the 000 Philips head bit for the removal and replacement of 51 eye wrenchingly small screws ... not there! Apparently they assumed I needed two 00 PH bits, pretty frustrating right off the bat. After using other bits in the set, I found them to be of poor quality and loose fitting. On the up side the magnetic driver is a life saver, at least I didn't lose any screws into the abyss! Also, the set does come with some really nice tools like assorted tweezers and prying instruments, but without good bits, had to return the kit.
2	bought this at the end of June 2019 and it flaps in the wind now...it was great for the first 30 days then lost the elasticity and now is just an eye sore....loose and flaps on the bottom....Velcro does not stick and YES I did follow the install instructions.
2	it didnt fit my tumbler
2	there no screw hole in front of it the back has the spots like a nail
2	Smaller than described and very chintzy. Paid $7.99, wouldn't have paid half that if I'd held it beforehand. Polka dots are beige. Returned. (Two stars because it came quickly, packaging was ok, and return was easy.)
2	I bought this for my husband. The package came damaged like it was used. I didn't even open it. Sending it back.
2	My kids love the package becoz they are JoJo fans.. IT IS STICKY AND MESSY..FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS 3 TIMES SAME RESULT..WORST SLIME EVER..
2	These had a really weird smell that has not gone away. I have used them in a closet and they made the closet also have a weird smell.
2	Too small to be practical for other than minimal amount of work on the fly Is small enough for briefcase
2	I’m sad to say the scalp therapy shampoo and conditioner did nothing for my dry flaky scalp. For the price I am very disappointed. The conditioner left my hair feeling a little softer but I believe that’s the wax inside. I have to use an Apple cider vinegar cleansing rinse to remove the wax buildup after a few weeks of use. I had high hopes... 😞
2	These fit along the front edge of my 07 Odyssey bumper. Note that you also need 8 MM for the rest of the undercarriage protector. The reason I gave 2 stars is because the design of these clips makes it so you can't put pressure on the clip without activating it. There are other clips on amazon that have a separate piece for the inner and outer section. This allows you to put full force on the outer section, then later push in the inner section. Since the inner section is integrated into this clip, you have to try to push on the edge of the clip which is much more difficult.
2	Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend. The sound quality was q
2	Very flat and not worth the money. It doesn’t have a removable cover. I needed 2 so I didn’t want to spend a fortune but I found nice, thicker ones at Walmart for around the same price or less.
2	Worked great, besides that 2 SD cards became corrupt after using it.
2	I had the measurements perfect yet the waist was way to loose. It did not look good so I had to return it.
2	Shipping took longer then expected.
2	This door lock worked great... for 18 months. Then, half of the buttons stopped working. Replacing the batteries didn’t help. The door is located in a long covered breezeway and sunlight nor rain ever hits it. We live in a low humidity location (San Jose, CA). The cost of this door lock is greatly diminished if you have to buy a new one every 18 months. I browsed through the reviews and this is quite common, so don’t say I didn’t warn you.
2	how can I give a review when this is a Christmas gift
2	Temperature seems to be about 8 degrees off from each other.
2	I do like that this case snaps together completely. I like the look of the case as well. It's not to bulky either. What I didn't like was not being able to use the fingerprint sensor. Also there is no cut out for the speaker at the top of the phone for you to listen. And because of that when your talking the whole case vibrates. Wish there was a cutout. That would definitely help. This case is more for a hands free person of which I am not. Wish I could send it back.
2	Does not have the scent or flavor of jasmine, only green tea. I gave these as a gift and was embarrassed at the poor quality, did not taste like the Mighty Leaf tea I'm accustomed to.
2	One remote will now only open one gate in my gated community. The code is the same for both gates. Only worked for 2 weeks. I had it checked with management.
2	This was a great mirror for a couple weeks, but then there were some major problems. The back light started flickering and I could not just turn on the front light, they would both come on no matter which button I pressed. I got a mirror with a light so I could get ready without bothering my roommate, and the strobing desk light was too much. I had to get a new mirror.
2	I ordered the one with usb power adapter, but it came without the adapter.
2	Short cord. Lampshade makes lamp very top heavy. I knock this thing over all the time.
2	The balls are very delicate and my Dog & Puppy chewed them up, and you do not carry replacement balls!
2	Too low to the ground you will have to put effort into getting in and out of the chair and it has no head rest, so I ended up gluing a pool noodle to the back of it to rest my head on. Used it 2 times at the beach and had to upgrade to a higher chair with the works.
2	It’s cut weird in the chest and not at all sizes correctly. I even went up A size just in case. Won’t order again
2	I was so excited to see these go down to $65 so I snagged them. I’ve heard they’re great & I even wore a pair of my friends chacos & they were SO comfortable. Not these. First off the straps were super long! After tightening just a little they dragged on the ground. Then it seemed to me there wasn’t enough arch support in them, I happen to have high arches and these were virtually flat. Also the heel was tight and the sandal pad itself was really hard!!! My feet hurt so bad after wearing these just twice for very short bouts. Absolutely disappointed & returning.** My friend had the same brand/size everything & hers were WAY different so idk what’s going on here. ** I think I’m just going to go into my REI to buy a sandal so I can try it on first, even the chacos. Another commenter said you have to break these in like a shoe? I don’t think so. So long story short these are heavy, hard, uncomfortable overpriced sandals from wherever Amazon is getting them :(
2	The product was separated from the zipper out of the package. I didn't open it right away and now it is too late. Be careful to open and check the quality once you receive it.
2	I've used this product a few times to extend the life of shoes. It's difficult to work with and the degree of adhesion varies depending on the material of the shoe sole.
2	Arrived broken. Tried to fix the chair. Not at all happy.
2	Cheap plastic. Labels are impossible to put on.
2	The table is made of poor quality materials and items easily break on it. Also, I did not think this through. Where do I put the top part of the table when the kiddos want to play pool?
2	The wagon is as advertised, however we didn’t receive the color we ordered. We probably could have sent it back to the vendor for exchange but chose not to. No big deal for us but if you may not receive the color you want.
2	This is the 4th time I've bought this mouse. The 2 times I got it at Best Buy it's been great. The 2 times I got it through Amazon it's been poor. Are these vendors selling cast offs?
2	I was really hoping this would work, but it didn't. I used a lot of it and it didn't stick and bond. You don't get very much and it was a pain to mix. A large dual syringe might be better to just squirt on the stone and mix. I might have to just use mortar or try a different epoxy.
2	These bookends are super cute and LOOK great, but they are NOT functional for kids! They only hold books up if they are tightly against the books, but it is VERY difficult to get the books to fit in there and they get pushed over very easily. It's too much of a hassle to return, so I'm keeping them, but they are more of shelf decorations and are not functional.
2	Very heavy, and doesn't last. Settled into my fine lines, and made me look older.
2	Covers the sticker on my lisence plate. Good quality, just unfortunate that I can’t use it.
2	The back brace is fine. The problem I have is with telemarketers. I am convinced that someone sold my name and phone number. Shortly after receiving my order (despite the fact that I am on the "no call list"), I started receiving persistent phone calls (3 - 4 times a day) from a telemarketer trying to sell additional braces and other pain relieving devices. The sales pitch is very deceiving, as the caller implies that they represent Medicare and warns that if I do not reply positively that Medicare could "declared me ineligible for further services. The automated calls offer to remove you from the call list if you press 9, which I have done repeatedly with no success, the calls keep coming. Be forewarned!
2	The product creates a lot of marks of water on my front sheild
2	great shoe. will use quite frequently
2	Just got these scissors in the mail. The plastic box was damaged and when I opened it, the scissors were kinda dirty (fingerprints/tiny marks.) We'll see how they work I guess...
2	The camera itself is amazing! What really changed my review was the customer service. I felt as if they were unprofessional when I received a micro SD card with the adapter rather than a regular 64gb SD card. I wasn’t expecting it and so I mentioned it to them. When I communicated with customer service it felt extremely unprofessional, so for that, I had to give this product two stars. I would recommend getting your camera elsewhere! :-)
2	Just not what i expected. Probably an item better bought in person.
2	Didn't finish it. Every story was like the last one. The book promised lots of details but it didn't deliver. Became bored after while.
2	If feels nice when using it, however its not good for removing eye makeup or a lip stain. Which is mostly why people buy these wipes.... to remove makeup. Smells nice and reasonable price.
2	Sizing seems off, although my son can wear a youth large in everything else, this was WAY too small for him.
2	Please someone fire Scotty the Gimp. This season has some good episodes, but most of it is asinine. Does Scotty have a high school degree? His writing suggests otherwise... This is like season 7 (Negan talks a lot, and plot holes are abundant....), except with more amateurish ninja turtle-like fighting scenes. I think Scotty might have thought that we would be into this, but he forgets that not everyone is 9 years old....
2	These work, but not very well. I was trying to wash with these and it was more work than I wanted. I instead too down all the blinds and wanted them in the shower. Much much easier
2	With everyone saying things like, "This is Gilliam's best!" and "Gilliam has outdone himself!", you'd think this movie is going to be the best thing since sliced bread. This is a very simple movie with a very simple plot. As the plot begins to unfold, it's like a slow let-down, gradually disappointing you more and more until you reach the end. Then, instead of saving you from total disappointment, this lethargic film continues to lull any unsuspecting victims to sleep. It really looks like the director went with the whole "Army of the 12 Monkeys" thing right up until the end, until he couldn't figure out how to tie it all together, so he just changed the whole ending into something very boring and drab, like a joke with no punchline.
2	I have used this product several years. This jar was gritty. It also seemed to be whipped much looser than before. It does finally smooth out by continuing to rub the product on the skin. Not pleased this time around.
2	It's easy to set up and the 360 degree view is awesome. But getting proper notifications never happens. I installed mine on my porch light. It'll notify you when the wind blows, but remain deathly quiet when stands right underneath the thing. Finally, I bought mine in March. It died in February. Like died; I can hear something rattling inside when I shake it. What a waste of money.
2	The gasket came out at some point and was lost. Why isn't it just glued into the top?
2	I ordered 2 Larges for my dog and they sent me 2 smalls.
2	There is a very little ink in these cartridges. I only print occasionally and i usually only print text with a color illustration here and there. I started getting messages from my printer almost immediately upon installing that the ink level was low! How much ink is in these cartridges anyway? Someone should be alerted that there is something seriously wrong with the amount of ink they put into the cartridges as opposed to how much they charge for them! This ink costs more than the finest perfume per ounce!
2	It was too small for the planner I ordered but to return it would cost to much so now I have an item I can’t use...otherwise it seems fine
2	Zipper broke one month in to school.
2	Exactly like picture. Fits well. Smells like mildew! Yuck
2	Ordered one size larger based on description and still too small in the waist
2	The back has no give so my son cannot recline when he gets tired. He cried the whole time. Unable to use now.
2	Bought these for basic training. Handy because they’re all black and have 8 pairs. Though they were always riding up my butt. Yikes! All that training with panties in riding up is the worse.
2	The brushed motor version of this frame is great. For some reason on the new brushless version, they got rid of the battery holder, and came up with this terrible rubber band idea. The frame arrived all warped to begin with. I heated it up with a heat gun and set a book on top to make it flat again. It worked, but as soon as you put a rubber band on, it will warp the frame again. Also, the little hooks that hold the rubber bands are worthless and pop off mid flight anyway. I ended up putting the rubber bands completely over the top of the canopy instead. It is better, but still not good. The only reason this got two stars instead of one is because the 3 blade props seem to perform better than the 4 blade props that came on my BetaFPV 65 pro.
2	After burp is terrible.
2	Didn't really do much for my dog.
2	Will not order again, they're not terrible- but no comparison to the original nespresso pods. Ugh... at the great price I really wanted to like these!!!!
2	Ordered the 4T for our 4 year-old in motor oil, navy, and khaki. Great fit for both length and in the waist. However, after just 2 months 2 of the 3 pairs of pants have holes in the knees. I estimate that he wore each pair (the ones with the holes) twice per week, or about 20 times before they ripped. He likes to play hard, but the pants from Old Navy are still holding up after nearly 6 months of use.
2	On my s10 the case fits well however the bottom is very flimsy. The silcone feels like it will break over time. I expected a more firm and hardened grip at the bottom of the case. Disappointed with this spigen case this time for my new phone.
2	Received it already damaged. It looks like it was used and someone decided to return it and it was resold. Package and collar were damaged. Bell on the collar is useless.
2	Very light weight and as another buyer mentioned, the handles are thin, with sharp edges and not comfortable. These are made like the cheap pans at the big box stores. If they were less than $30 for the set I would say they might be a good buy since they do appear to have a decent coating and are about as solidly built as you can get for thin aluminium. Not what I expected and there is no way they will last more than a month in my kitchen, so I'm sending them back.
2	It is comfortable, but I am not a fan of the color. It will get dirty soon. The upgraded one should also come in black. Update after 4 months of use: So the mouse pad dampened from the middle after only 4 months of use, as displayed in the pictures.
2	Loved the style but two months into school it broke in Two places- zipper and seam of strap! Too late to return.
2	I haven't used it yet so I can't speak to the quality, but the photo shows an assortment of colors. What I got was 6 gold, 4 brown, 1 gold/brown mix, 2 silver and the other 7 were mixed colors. not at all what I was expecting.
2	This is the same exact blade that came with my Ego electric mower. I'm still using the first blade, but BOY does it get dull quickly. I have to keep resharpening with a file. This is the exact same size, but they should have used harder, better steel to make the blade. For this price, it should stay sharp longer. Once you own their product, they KNOW you have to buy their blade. \ Not satisfied. If it were half this price, I would have given it more stars. TOO expensive for what you get.
2	Definitely Cute And Comfortable But It’s Little Loose I Wish They Had An Extra Small.
2	the charging tip fell off after a month of use
2	Totaly not the color pictured on Amazon. I kinda knew it was a grey but this bag is a light grey. Picture on Amazon is more of a dark grey.
2	So I wanted a tree for my Nightmare before Christmas themed room. I am disappointed by the tree. 5 of the lights aren’t working and the tree is super thin. Pretty disappointed.
2	They don't work very well. They don't remove food, debris, etc. from the sink or dishes, pots, pans, etc. better, in fact are worse, than any other sponges. They also don't stay attached to the sink as they are supposed to. Keep sliding down. One good thing: the blue one does an superior job of removing stuck on food from the pan of my oven-fryer, the one with the holes in it that catches and cooks on food. Other than that, I would not purchase this product again.
2	Too large would like to return the item. Need return label Thanks Vera Gregory
2	After having this case for only a few weeks, the corners started to crack. I am not hard on my laptop, so I am unsure how or why they cracked. They were so bad that the case would not stay on by itself anymore. Very disappointing.
2	Got as gift for teen girl... she was not intrigued or impressed. Only get Van Gogh necklace charm for true art fans or fans of Van Gogh. Average people don't appreciate it!
2	Not worth it. The plastic latches on the bottom constantly come off so I tied the fabric in place. Cupholders come off and is very uncomfortable. Save some money and buy better. Hate there carseats
2	It doesn't task as Frappuccino as it advertised. Too sweet, no coffer favor.
2	On the plus side, the light is super bright (350 lumens) and the horn is very loud. Also able to go up to 2 weeks without recharging the batteries. The top of my unit got wet because of rain. The horn button seems fairly water-tight, but the top of the main unit's housing is another story. After 14 hours of drying-out there is still condensation inside the clear plastic covering of the solar panel. Also, horn electronics have shorted -- horn goes off randomly when plugged in or just produces an anemic chirp. There is also water leaking from the horn jack receptacle which entered through the solar panel cover. Leaving the unit in the sun all day doesn't recharge batteries, so I'm thinking the solar feature is more of a gimmick than anything useful. As a guesstimate, using the light with full-beam about 1 to 1.5 hours a week (with very liberal use of the horn whenever riding) requires the unit to be charged once every 2 weeks. A red light flashes when batteries are running low. Charging takes about 6 - 8 hours. As another nitpick, it's really annoying to cycle through 4 light modes just to turn the unit off. Depending on your riding style, the horn button clasp may be prone to slip when you press it. The horn clasp is a rubber band-like and not a bolt. Since most horn-light combos are like this, I wouldn't deduct points for this. Just something to be aware of. Overall it's a good light, but it's not rainproof or waterproof. And the solar panel feature is possibly a sales gimmick. If you decide to purchase, don't allow it to get wet!
2	I was really hoping this item would help with some blood sugar control..I've been taking it for about 2 months without change
2	I bought this as an alternative to the metal spring traps, thinking it would be easier to set and more effective. I've used it for a couple of months and have yet to catch a gopher, although I have caught several gophers using the spring traps. So far its been useless but I will keep trying.
2	Not terribly happy with this bees wax. It feels diluted, and is MUCH more translucent that what the pictures showed. There is still the smell of real bees wax, but it is VERY diluted. The flexibility is there, but I'm hesitant to use it for the things that I've traditionally used real bees wax for in the past. I do NOT recommend this. Might be okay for candles, but it is definitely NOT 100% real.
2	Box was completely ripped up when delivered
2	No more shine. look too old after few months. How to return it?
2	Shirt is fine The product was shipped like it was returned just rolled up in a ball, un buttoned. Very unprofessional for a company. Disappointed
2	This product did not fit my needs nor was the instillation easy. Missed my return window now I am stuck with this item. Not Happy.
2	One of the seams was incomplete (had a hole in the seam) and I hate to return items as it is too much trouble.
2	This does not work. Seriously.
2	The instructions were almost unintelligible. I am going to look for a YOUTUBE video or further instructions to see how it works. So, I don't know if it works.
2	Very cheap...and it shows.
2	Small and very disappointed with the size...It looks like something for a child.....
2	I would love to give this train a 5 Star. My grandson absolutely loved it. I’ve bought because of that and both have broken. I should get a free train!
2	Paint is transparent. Needs many coats or to be mixed with other paint. Maybe good for beginners or children?
2	Ultra thin, lightweight and borderline flimsy. Material and size are more suitable as a pen-pencil holder or other small, lightweight items. Base is thin metal with no weight underneath so will likely tip and slide around easily. Returned. Worth a few more bucks to get something much better.
2	I ordered two pairs. The first one was perfect, the second was tight around the thighs. Plus the shipping takes so long. The second pair arrived two weeks late.
2	Most of the buttons worked when these were new, but never the one that pairs to your device. I was able to get them to pair by starting my music, and using the settings on my phone. Since I bought them last minute before a trip I just went with it. Now, a year later, none of the buttons work. The sound quality and noise cancelling were very nice, but now the volume is stuck at a level only audible in a quiet room... Not really where you need noise cancelling.
2	I put in 12 oz water and only about 5-6 oz come out then i press the button again and another ounce comes out.
2	The salt and pepper shakers look good, but the salt dumps out everytime you shake just a bit, too many holes in the top, and they are too big. i will continue my search...
2	Cheap quality, I ordered wrong size.
2	The machine itself works alright but the remote that came with it doesn’t work. Very inconvenient to use without the remote. You to start the machine n the get on the vibrating machine.
2	Battery life was terrible. Doesn't last a while gym session which is normally about 1-2 hours. Guess you get what you pay for.
2	This cup is a good idea, but it keeps resetting during use. The temperature must be reprogrammed each time that it resets.
2	Already have a cane with this exact design (purchased 10 years ago from Travel Smith), and wanted a matching one, as walking with two canes is better for my mother than using a walker. The design on this cane is the same, but the quality of the cane, and the diameter is very different. This one is too narrow for the quad cane tips that I purchased from Amazon. The metal doesn't appear very thick, so not substantial. Unfortunately, I can return it, IF I pay the postage. I'll just donate it to a charity, as it won't satisfy our needs.
2	Like the variety of games in this pack, but the cards are small for kids game. I was hoping for larger cards. Kinda cheap looking.
2	The lights worked great for a couple of months, but then quickly started dying out one after another. The product supposedly has an 18-month warranty, but I was unable to contact the seller: the email and phone number on file with Amazon belongs to another business of the same name! Eventually, Amazon kindly provided a refund, but I would not recommend buying this product in the first place.
2	Broke first time I used it. Never even got my ipad backed up on it.
2	The umbrella isnt as large as I expected once it is opened up. It could cover two ppl if they are close together. My issue is closing the umbrella. The button will collapse the umbrella but it takes a lot of muscle to actually get the handle down. ALSO, its almost impossible to wrap the umbrella closed with the strap. I would not purchase again.
2	And E It was easy to install but I could only get 22 stations, even the stations that were only 20 miles away only came in when the weather was clear. In foggy weather even CBS would not stay tuned in.
2	Amazing but missing 3 cube and I already armed ... and I don’t see any option to claim or ask for my other 3 cube :(
2	Looks like there is maybe a shipment or storage issue (clay got hot) or just a manufacturing error, but I and many of my artists friends that received this product from the April run have received crumbly product. I'm not sending it back because I will remedy it with an additive, but just so everyone knows. This is the first time I have received the translucent in this condition.
2	Pretty disappointing
2	These are half the usual size. Not a very good value. The pool store has 1 oz for under $2 each - twice as much for less.
2	The first time I washed the shirts the gold heart on one of the shirts started to melt off. Cheaply made.
2	Brought several cans of this did not seem to work for me
2	Little to no change after 4weeks
2	I had purchased this for my samsung galaxy and the installation did not go well, the video states you should use a case to help guide the installation but because I didn't have one I couldn't use that case it was a mess. Somehow dust got underneath the sticky part of the shield and there is absolutely no way to get ride of it. Don't recommend
2	I have an iPhone Xr and the magnet was way too weak to hold it. Heavy base and metal finish is nice.
2	I don't like it, my boyfriend use it not me
2	I'll start by saying I LOVE Death Wish Coffee but I hate the pods. I highly recommend to anyone that wants to get the full experience of this great coffee to by the full bag of beans or ground coffee rather than these pods. I am not sure what it is about these pods, but they just don't work. The coffee is watered down and diluted and doesn't taste great. I resulted in cutting open the pods and putting the grounds into the special reusable kcup and it taste 100 times better. I know i could have returned it but i needed this coffee. I will continue to be a customer but will never buy the pods again unless they figure out how to change the design of them to work more efficiently.
2	Doesn't fit was too big
2	Arrived fast but was quickly disappointed. It took over 30 mins just to remove the film from the three shelves which then uncovered some sort of varnish drippage and spots on corners of each shelf where the plastic sticky paper did not cover. Also there are a couple tiny little pinholes through this plastic sheeting because they were stuck even more to them, that have already begun to rust. The size however is perfect and I don’t want to deal with the hassle of sending back but would not have purchased had a known
2	Didn't see any difference in tbe texture of my skin. Don t waste ypur money.
2	My sim card did not fit in this
2	Our young rabbits slipped right out of these each time we put them on, even in the tightest configuration. Might work better on larger rabbits or other small pets.
2	The title says it all. I went for this mouse and keyboard to replace an old failing unit. I passed by many much lower priced options and stepped up to this somewhat expensive offering. I did so because I placed value and trust in the Logitech name over the unknown brands of the lower priced units. Both units have a quality feel. They work well and were easy to setup. I've given this a low rating and am dissapointed because the keyboard is noisey. It rings like a bell when you type. It's very annoying and not what I would expect out of a quality product. The noise is given off by all fo the keys rattling. It's worse when you use the rear stands to elevate the back of the keyboard. I'm not sure I'm going to be able to tolerate this....
2	Although these slippers are very comfortable, the stitching came apart in several areas. I have not even had them for 1 year so I am not expecting them to last very long.
2	Don't expect the best workout of your life, it is an okay workout machine that can take up a small amount of space.
2	This rug is not well made but it looks nice in my sitting room. It has a black backing and is pretty sparse so the black shows through. It is soft and the color is great; just wish they had added more fibers!!
2	First wear of each pair and there are holes.
2	Did like the fact that the fibers were not present. I purchased the same brand in store and it was great but this purchase must have been dried up something because it didn’t give me the same application. I’m unhappy with this purchase!
2	Chain broke in half after second time using it. The mesh inside tore.
2	I loved the deal but the ink didn’t last longer as it says.
2	When I ordered this mini, it was delivered in a bubble wrap envelope and it was clear the blister pack had been crushed in transit. The mini was broken. I returned the item, ordered a replacement, and the replacement showed up, also delivered in a bubble wrap envelope, in worse condition than the first. I've already spent more time dealing with this than it would've taken to go to a hobby store and just buy a similar item in person.
2	WAY more low cut in the arms then the picture makes it out to be!
2	July 1, 2019 Update: Two of the four bulbs I installed have gone out. One went out within 6 months, the other went out about a month ago. I have other bulbs in similar conditions which have lasted many years. I am disappointed in the short life of these. I have adjusted my overall rating down because of this problem. Original Review: These does exactly what I want them to do: they turn off in daylight, and on in darkness. I was skeptical because when I opened the package and looked at the bulbs, I could not find a photo sensor … so I expected these to stay on all the time, contrary to the claim. But, even though I couldn't find the photo sensor, it must be there. These do indeed turn on at night and off in the morning. The only reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is that they were described as "cool white". I'd describe them as "blue-white". (I'll take some of the blame for this, though, because the description did say 6000K, and I didn't pay enough attention to that. I wish I'd gotten the 3000K version.) In the end, these do the job they say they'll do.
2	This came in a beat-up heavily pre-used box with a bunch of newspaper shoved inside. The bottles each had a big piece of packing tape over the pump, neither of which held and the inside of the box was greasy where it leaked. Wouldn't reorder from this seller.
2	I didn't see a difference.
2	yes it saw the size but they shrank a lot. Pretty soft. I wouldn't buy again.
2	0 to 60 in.... no magic then suddenly super powerful with no training and somehow able to do a perfect spell. Honestly dreaded getting deeper into book Hurts my head to try and understand how the author can cram stuff together and everybody loves it
2	After wearing my bracelet 3 times the green stone chipped and now it’s white underneath painted not real stone. Disappointed with this purchase
2	I buy medium cause I see reviews saying runs small but medium is too big, and not a good quality
2	Like others, I wondered how the stock Eljer Titan flush handle could cost more than twice as much as this one. Well, I found the answer. First, the lever had to be cut to fit so it wouldn't hit the refill tube...that I was ready for. But then I discovered that there was no way the square rubber gasket would fit into the square hole in the tank, it was way too tight. I ended up putting it in from the inside, and was able to tighten up the plastic nut enough to hold the handle assembly securely. The handle on the old, stock unit, which lasted 15 years, was made of pot-metal, and the little pocket that the lever fits into had split open at the pressure/wear point. The new handle is made of plastic, with a slightly different cam mechanism. I would bet that it won't last nearly as long...time will tell. The bottom line: Spend the extra $10-12 to get a more durable handle that you can install in about 2 minutes with no jury-rigging hassles.
2	Stick to the bottles. This was not good.
2	Not what I expected
2	definitely too small for a 3 year old.
2	IT'S LIKE ALL WATER WITH CARAMEL COLORING. jUST A SLIGHT HINT OF VANILLA. SORRY.
2	Lightweight and compact- but wouldn’t stay open or retract after literally maybe a dozen uses. Would not recommend.
2	I can’t get these childproof tops open. What a nightmare. Even my husband is aggravated. Push down and turn. All they do is click. They remain closed.
2	Installation was easy and clarity was good but it is not case friendly. With an otterbox, the protector didn’t sit flush with the screen so it was very difficult to use the touchscreen. We had to take it off so buying these was a waste of money
2	The product description indicates a digital copy is included. Unfortunately, because this is an older release, the digital copy expired in 2014. I contacted Amazon and they ultimately informed me my only option was to return this product and order the more expensive, recent release. Just be aware if the digital copy is something you utilize, this product description is not accurate.
2	Not quite right for my car... they're designed to have to cut up to fit.
2	I have been very frustrated with my Petcube recently. The device doesn’t want to connect to the Wifi, which means I either have to reconnect it or reset the dang thing every time I go to use it. I’ve tried reaching out to the Petcube customer service to trouble shoot but nothing has worked. The emails between the customer service team were just your basic like making sure the Petcube was plugged in.. and then I tried to call them and could barely understand the person on the other end of the phone. The WiFi router is within a few feet of the device. (I also have other smart devices that have no issues pairing with my WiFi) I am disappointed that I have to pay a monthly subscription for something that hardly works. Yesterday, we had horrible thunderstorms and wanted to check in on my puppy and numerous times could not connect, that was the final straw. Great idea but not the best. However, when the device actually works it is great! I can see my puppy and interact if I wanted. (But only happens about 50% of the time)
2	These were a huge disappointment. They were advertised as 1.5 inch rings but they are over 2 inches in diameter. If you don’t want bigger than 1.5” DO NOT BUY THESE. Other than size issues, they seem fine and the colors are pretty. I’m just irritated because i needed 1.5 inch like they promised.
2	I've used these bands for 12 days and today the green one snapped in half. They are sending a new one free of charge so that is good, but I don't think the quality is as good as it can be.
2	Cables worked fine for several months and then all of a sudden stopped charging my devices! Avoid buying this item!
2	They fell apart within the first month of purchasing. They were bought for a 5 month old mini dachshund.
2	Zipper closure is one of the dumbest designs I’ve ever seen. As this was advertised as a possible laptop carrier, one compartment should be felt? lined for iPads as well. For those of you who want to solve the dbl zipper problem, drill holes in the ends of the green plastic zipper pulls and thread a zip tie through them
2	would not stick on the LED screen
2	This is a promotion video for cyber security companies.
2	This book must have been written from someone from a different country. I looked for a recipe for pot roast in the Visor electric pressure cooker and it calls for boiled beef. It has several recipes for mutton. This book is a big disappointment. I had just bought a Casino and wanted to learn how to cook in it. A total waste of money.
2	The Fram air filter was... well, its an air filter. The negative side is that the recent new packaging technique Amazon is using by simply slapping a label on the manufacturer's box. The filter I just received was in a very thin display box. It arrived with the filter having been bent in shipping and the box totally destroyed on both ends. There was not even tape on either end of the box lid to prevent the item from falling out. Obviously, it had. I do realize that packaging and shipping is a major cost in selling products. However, if the manufacture does not provide adequate protection for shipping, it should either be available in a consolidated order, or a shipping charge applied to cover the cost. Either way, shipping in display boxes is NOT adequate for shipping damage protection.
2	I got the desert tan and green case. The green looks good. But on the tan plastic case which holds it together has a light red/orange tinted to it as if it's been worn out and degrading. But I've only had the case for 48 hours. I dont know if it's cheap material or plastic. But a little disappointed. I've heard good things about these cases and had high hopes....
2	Good spacious design, but not sturdy enough and not super easy to start threads.
2	My TV couldn't recognize PS1 games on my PS2. With this it can but the image looks terrible. The characters in the games like final fantasy 8 or resident evil 2 looks really edgy. The regular PS2 games like Final fantasy X look blurry. Also when switching between 780p and 1080p, the image gets cut in half. Top half is the game and the bottom half is just some distortion. The power plug is also loose so it gets connected and disconnected easily. I expected it to not turn the games into HD but I didn't expect it will make the games look terrible. Will be returning it.
2	You get what you pay for
2	Holy cow this thing is loud!!!! I am 2 rooms away and can still hear it. It sounds like I have the vacuum cleaner going in the next room. I also had an issue setting the timer. It kept wanting to change the temperature. I reset it and was finally able to set the timer. The noise is getting on my last nerve! May have to return it for a dehydrator that is quieter. I can't attest as to the durability as this is the first time I have used it, but I would recommend you find something quieter.
2	The case is ripping apart around the charging port area and the volume buttons area. i had the same case before and it didn’t happen until I bought a new one but then I returned to this case because of how lightweight it was. Not happy this time around though...
2	It didn't fit at all like what I thought! It was made cheaply and not the quality it looks like in the picture... truly disappointed!
2	Only works half the time
2	The glasses were great! The ice molds were a let down. Only one of them held water and the other is essentially useless because it doesn’t hold the seal and water seeps out only making 1/2 and ice ball. Pretty disappointed
2	Not as good of a quality as I thought I would be getting. I put painters tape around the edges because they were sharp and already had rust. It was also dented in some places.
2	Glue on some of the letters did not hold up making me lose some of my letters.
2	I guess for now it will do for me until I find something else that is of better quality. I just purchased this and it already ripped after lifting the bag for the first time with my clothes in it. I read someone’s review about the same problem before purchasing and had my fingers crossed hoping it wouldn’t happen to me... but it did :/ On the bright side, however, I was able to fit an entire dresser full of clothes into this bag! I had to get rid of my dresser and make more space in my room ASAP and had to purchase something quickly. I only bought one at first because I wanted to make sure I liked the product and also to see how much I could actually fit before getting more. When I first received the bag, I did not like the quality. I wanted to return it but found out returns were not accepted for this item. So I had no choice but to give it a try, and to my surprise, was able to fit all the clothes from my large dresser. I definitely did not expect everything to fit! I thought I would have for sure needed at least two. Anyway, I was very happy with my purchase at that point and didn’t have any problems either, so I ended up purchasing another one even though the price had increased. That, of course, was a mistake as the plastic from second bag tore the moment I lifted it with my clothes to set it aside. I haven’t touched the first bag since I put my clothes in it but I’m pretty sure if I touch it again, it will rip. The bag definitely saves you a ton of space but I would suggest looking elsewhere for a similar product that is better quality. It is definitely worth it to spend a little extra for a stronger quality bag that will last longer. This particular item, on the other hand, is cheaply made and is not worth the price, unless the cost is less than $5. Yes, I was able to fit everything in the bag but what good does that do for me if the bag is ripped up? Keep in my mind the bag is lightweight only because it’s made from very cheap quality. I shouldn’t have purchased the second one but oh well... like I said, it’s okay for now until I find something better.
2	Just cuttings stuck in the dirt. No roots. Delivery was rough and cuttings came out of the dirt.
2	I expected something of higher quality. I’m using them but the are cheap.
2	Just ok - no better than a store.
2	the one they sent me was too plain compared to he one in the picture.
2	Cheap 3m double sided mounting tape. Seller should invest in a higher grade tape. Had to use screws to mount a 9 mm beretta. I also doubt the magnets will hold even 15 pounds. Good price but don’t expect too much.
2	They fit almost any chair you can think of, but the straps are entirely too long while the Velcro part is entirely too short, which means that the straps come undone frequently. And, if you're like me and spend hours a day in your office chair, you're going to find that these armrests go flat in about a month. Not worth the money spent.
2	Too small for that prize
2	Had to use all 3 screens that came with the kit before I could get one with proper adhesion. Two of them had defects in the glass: no amount of pressure was going to remove it (I thought it was an air bubble until I removed it and looked at it with a magnifying glass. The alignment frame is great, but nothings going to help if the product is defective
2	I am very sensitive to products, so it probably was me not the ingredients. but I could NOT use it.. I was unsure of how many stars to give for that reason.
2	I was very excited when I first got this little cam in the mail. However, I was very disappointed with the way the app and min cam fuction together . it's always having problems connecting to the app. I wanted to use it as a dash cam but very time I place it in my car the network crashes and u cant connect to the device and must reset it to factory settings.. app needs alot of work to run smoother while streaming life video and keep network setting stored .. keeps giving me connections failed message and wrong password when I just set it up.. I think I will be returning this product ..
2	The fit was not good with the fan. It was a lot more narrow than the original radiator
2	I like the vinyl but the tops of my sheets are damaged and the shipping box was fine,
2	It was so cute and fit me well but after I wore it once I washed it and hung it to dry I noticed the seams fell apart. So now I have two holes that I will have to sew.
2	I wanted to like this screen protector, it looks great and the rounded edges are really nice. The first one broke within 3 days without even dropping it. I had it in my front pocket, took it out and the corner was cracked. Nothing else was in my pocket so I was kinda perplexed on how that was even possible. I went to install the 2nd one and it would not apply without bubbles so I just gave up. I've installed many different types of screen protectors so it wasn't user error, it just constantly bubbled like there was something stuck to the bottom of it. Would be helpful if they also provided a frame to assist with installation. Not thrilled, going to order elsewhere at this point since now I have no screen protector.
2	this is a very lightweight product. I was looking for something that would give my curls more of a bouncy polished look, but I guess this isn't the product for me. it also made my curls way tighter versus loosening them which it claims to do.
2	Not quite sure how to use it. If I can figure that out it might work.
2	Don't expect the cord to impress, unless it's just there for looks. The one I received would provide a small trickle, and most riders ended up with like 2 percent more battery after disconnecting.
2	Beware: does not fit elite controller with paddles. This is hilarious to me; why would a company purposefully exclude players who don't mind to pay more? That's just what I did in the end... I paid more.. when I bought another brand's charging station and used that instead.
2	Good quality. But it’s pink. Not worth it to return it for a refund. Pretty disappointing.
2	I would not recommend. Babies can peel the cushion right off. Also does not stick well and it looks like once I take it off it will take some of the surface with it. Not that thick so you can still feel the sharp edges thru product.
2	The video records in 480p quality at best. The battery doesn't last an hour. Charging instructions are bad. And there is no way to remove/fix the time stamp.
2	Good hair but disappointed about the lace
2	After one or two washes the material feels papery and the edges almost seem faded. Was I not supposed to put this in the washer? Oh well.
2	They do not stay put.
2	Well, the product is a pretty color and styled nicely but the cup size is a little too big and the bottoms are FAR too snug! Didn’t get to wear to the beach anyway.
2	I been using it, however, the drops do not dispense the way drops should....too thick! 12 weeks recommended I read was way too long to see some kind of results, when you can get that with LoreaL and other products that recommend the same. Will return. Thanks for reading this.
2	Color was different from photo. Had to return.
2	For years I have been buying Riggs Wrangler cargo pants but they didn't seem to last long so I wanted to give something else a try, I didn't think that I could go wrong with the more expensive Carhartt pants but I was wrong! The fit is fine, but the cargo pockets are way to low for a 30 inch inseam. Not only do I have to bend quite a bit to get items from the cargo pockets but items in the pockets actually rub on my calves when I walk. It also seems like the left cargo pocket is located to far forward, the seam actually runs over the center of my kneecap. The bottom right corner of the left cargo pocket actually sits right between my knee and the ground whenever I kneel down and it is rather uncomfortable! I don't know if this was a factory second, but i won't be buying more!
2	Fan stopped running after a few months of use.
2	Good headset for one month but the cord splitter broke and now it’s unusable. It was not from normal wear and tear - the piece just came off. I don’t even know how to get a replacement piece.
2	The product came all broke up, not a single tablet it’s all crumbs. It’s the first time I have ordered this kind of product and pretty it will be the last.
2	This book started out good but during the middle of the book it got really slow. It took me a lot longer than usual to finish and I found myself skipping pages. It got better towards the end, and then it was over.
2	Loved the color but doesn't fit right and need to return it
2	Use rechargeables! Must replace batteries every 3 months and always at 3 am. I have seven interconnected. Very annoying. Hard to tell which needs batteries replaced. All seven demand new batteries while the batteries are still running strong. I switched to rechargable Eneloop Pro but there is no change in replacement frequency. Speech is difficult to understand and not repeated so I still don't know where the fire is. Better to spend more on Nest or less on a non line powered version with 10 year sealed battery. 2 star because the smoke sensor works and the interconnect works. I regret buying this model. And the irritation of getting a ladder out at 3 am to replace 280 pairs of batteries over the next 10 years. RIDICULOUS! UGH! I hope they quit working early.
2	I like the Kumon method so I bought many Kumon books. Unfortunately the Kumon word problems series is very poorly designed. For every page, the first problem is good but it has an example solution. The rest of the problems have almost exactly the same pattern (with different numbers), thus kids do not even need to read the question carefully, but just follow the pattern and fill in different numbers. Therefore this book is not much useful. A good word problem book should lead kids to think about every question and find out the proper solution. There are patterns among word problems, but the book should not have made it so obvious that kids do not need to think at all.
2	9 mos. old, worked ok untill now. opened door and handle would not return to normal position, can push handle in & it stays. will see if i can get a free replacement !!!
2	Soft inside but very poorly made. Guess you get what you pay for.
2	Far too repetitive. Far too repetitive. Far too repetitive. Far too repetitive. Far too repetitive. Far too repetitive. Get the picture ??
2	Quality construction and attractive style don't make up for a poor design. The adjustable lenses don't adjust far enough, so I need to wear my glasses. But my glasses don't fit comfortably inside the goggles. And many VR sites require the user to push a button, but these goggles don't allow that. Google cardboard isn't as pretty, but it works better and costs less.
2	omg! so I bought this for my bunny. My first bunny so I didn't know exactly how the alfalfa hay was to look like. I opened the box and was like..hmm they are very compress together...been feeding it for a month because I bought the 5 pound one..and My bunny still ate it I was like oh ok. I decided to order a bag of oxbow alfalfa hay which came in today and was like holly sh*t!! is this how its suppose to look like?? it actually looks fresh. So i went back to this page and checked out the bad reviews this time and looked at the pics customers has been posting...and wow.....my batch was super old...dry...dark...dusty....smh!! felt so sorry for what I've been feeding my little bunny! so i quickly tossed it out.
2	Easy install. High quality. NOT adhesive all over, JUST around the edges. Disappointed because their other cases are adhesive all over.
2	These have a major flaw. The ankle strap is the same length as all the other straps. This means you must go buy a strap from somewhere else to make these work. I got 2 straps from Harbor Freight for 5 bucks, cut them to twice the length of the ones provided, melted the ends and put them together.
2	Not a long lasting product at all.Ineffective too.
2	Disappointed. Not anyway as good as 4. Graphics and storyline are lacking.
2	I’ve been using these 6 months. While they are great lights, they don’t last long. 2 out of 4 have completely quit working and I’m sure the others aren’t far behind.
2	As good as a regular Sharpie, which I love. But I paid extra for these hoping I'd be able to read my garden markers longer. They faded just as quickly as when I use any other permanent marker, including Sharpies.
2	I took a shot buying these as opposed to the powered and lighted dot shot. Even with playing with the brightness on my tv the reticles are hard to see. They do stick well with no residue though. Overall just pony up the extra ten dollars for the lighted version.
2	Light works but it doesn’t rotate at all so I gave it 2 stars
2	Just have the father/other parent read a regular baby book. This was so basic it was hardly helpful.
2	The silver coating falls off and sticks to the leather projects
2	OK for what I wanted it for. Not great quality, very wrinkly. I use it for my down comforter to protect it but have another decorative bed cover on the top.
2	Definitely a fake product. The packaging looks like it was printed on a home printer. What I do like are the pink holder things. They don't have a lip around them so it will contact the skin better. I will try being the Smooth Away refills.
2	When I first opened the linen, I thought the quality was poor, the material was too thin. I still gave it a chance because it at least felt good, really soft. After one wash, the seem of one of the pillow cases opened. And yes, washing instructions were followed. One wash?! Seriously?! Calling Amazon now.
2	Not a fan of this product. The rollers are too heavy and the clips don't hold them in place
2	Basically like water ... my mother was very disappointed she compared it to the other ones off amazon and those actually have a smell . Wouldn’t buy again!
2	Not suitable for S7 edge. Badly made cheap plastic, the seller sells this case for only $5.00 in his store.
2	The piece that is supposed to close over the paper is slightly too big in many of the tags. I had to cut a sliver off of one of the sides to get it to snap back in.
2	even a small size is too big and they do not have enough compress
2	CHEAP PLASTIC. DIFFICULT TO ASSEMBLE. HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT IS TO BE DISPLAYED NOR IF IT WILL LAST AT ALL. I EXPECT ALLTHE TINY BEADS FALLING OFF AS THE MATERIAL AS IT DRY ROTS!
2	I searched for THICK, no show socks. These are not thick. I have a very narrow, low volume foot and need thick socks to help shoes fit. I am sure for most people these are great and they even come in a large size. Just not thick.
2	Got these for a kid for christmas, they started to come apart on the first couple shots, the heads are not connected well at all, the glue seems to be dried out and they just seperate, this is in a manual firing mega pistol, I didn't try it in any of the electric guns since they put way more stress on the bullets. They do however make a really good whistling noise when fired, that is until they disintegrate.
2	This came with a bad black lead wire so it is pretty useless. Now I have to figure out why the wire has no continuity or just get a different lead wire that has the same ends so I can use the attachments.
2	They are thin and rough but not a bad price for the set.
2	Great game but the low energy/having to buy energy for moves dims this gaming experience. This game has Great graphics and interesting plot and execution but the constant energy low after a few moves killed this for me and really turned me off.
2	The bag looked great when I got it, nice color and pretty strap, 2 stars for that, because I only used it 2 weeks until it started tu rip!, I don’t even carry much weight. also before I used it I had to wait like a week until the stink went away. Like other reviews say, it smell like gasoline for some reason. I really wanted to love this bag, pitty
2	Love the picture but the numbers were too small and too blurry
2	Runs a little small, but don't really feel or see a difference wearing these. As long as you put some type of sweat gel on, you do sweat a lot.
2	It s a very bad product
2	If you're looking for reasonable quality socks that fit well, these aren't the socks you're looking for. They fit well, but the quality is poor (the first pair I pulled out of the bag had a hole in the toe before I even tried to put them on. They material is ok, but not as comfy as I'd like. They feel like they'll only last a few washings, but with so many in the bag, I haven't had to wear a pair after washing it yet.
2	This was the first letter board I've ever bought. The outcome is great, it's very pretty. I picked this particular board because it was cheap, looking back now I would have spent a few more dollars if I didnt have to cut out alllll the letters AND screw the back stand peices on.
2	I weight 200lbs. After one week, each time I sit in the chair the hydraulic support immediately begins slowly lowering. This is an issue since the maximum height of the chair is required to meet the minimum height of my desk. The chair is comfortable overall. Width is sufficient for fat bodies so long as you're okay at minimum height. Lumbar support and headrest make me question the ergonomic design. Construction is solid. Heavy duty bolts provide support for a wide range of motion. Would not purchase again or recommend.
2	Havent set it up to control the other remotes yet. I will update afterwards. Otherwise, just put batteries in it and it works. Samsung 60 inch UHD TV that came with the mini remote and it stopped working right after I serviced the TV with a new main board as the blacks were looking terrible. The new remote isn't able to setup the TV. Only the samsung master remote will work. I had to order one of those to get the TV to stop asking to set it up.
2	It broke after two weeks. The button that turns it on was pushed in and got stuck. Now it won't turn on.
2	Phone has never had good Wi-Fi connection, has limited range for calls and texts, even though people with the same phone have good reception at the same locations. what's up with that?
2	Not that good in my opinion. The only reason I kept them was that they were better than the insoles that my boots came with. I’m not sure what brand to try now.
2	When we got it we couldn’t even get it open. It was stuck shut. We had to wait for my husband to get home from the field. When he finally got it open it was still a B to open every single time. Being he was gone for so long I’m sure it was over any return policy limit. But I wasn’t letting me or my daughter cut off any fingers. I’m sure not all have this problem but this was my expierence.
2	They are very low-end ear buds. They work, but the fit isn't great, and neither is the sound. We aren't too worried about it, since it is for our teens that tend to lose them anyway, but we won't be purchasing them again in the future.
2	This case, maybe it’s this ones specific they sent me. It keeps turning on and off and it gets annoying! Maybe something with the battery makes it come on and off.
2	Constantly has issues connecting to Bluetooth. Sound quality went bad quickly. Base almost disappeared entirely. Way to expensive for just an LED light.
2	I was underwhelmed with this case. The silicon bumper fit loosely and easily stretched out during normal use of phone. It did not fit snug at all.
2	It works as expected, but it’s not a practical kitchen tool. Not worth the money.
2	Barely sticky and certainly won’t hoist up the girls at all. What a disappointment.
2	First books were significantly better
2	Got these at a great price and was excited to try them. Unfortunately, the case was significantly broken when I opened the package. It seems like the pens are undamaged, but I was quite disappointed. Looks like the case will have to be scrapped very soon. When I purchase something new, I expect it to be in great condition.
2	I wore it once and the clasp came apart. I had to fix it with needle nose pliers. Made cheap, you get what you pay for.
2	I continue to hear so much about this from cast iron enthusiasts so I gave it a go to see what the hype was. Frankly, not really impressed for the cost and would recommend crisco over this every time in regards to overall seasoning ability. One small benefit is the smell is slightly better than that if other oils when seasoning cast iron but I don’t think that outweighs the negatives.
2	1 ballast worked and the other would crap out after 10 seconds. Tested on both headlights with the 1 defective ballast and it would repeat on each headlight.
2	Not shure if works rest of parts don't work from Amazon purchased all new part
2	It does not rotate as a Lazy Susan should. When I put spice bottles in it, it just slides on the shelf and does not rotate as a lazy susan should. Very disappointed in the product but too much of hassle to return them.
2	This was very difficult to work with, even when laid flat and let rest it still had a terrible curl to it making it impossible to tint my taillights. Ended up throwing away because it cant be used. Will end up having to pay someone to tint my lights.
2	I purchased this product for my honda accord. It fits nice but i noticed difference into the air in the cabin. I dont think and do not believe that there is a difference and the description is a little foolish
2	Cute,but arived damaged. Amazon won’t do an even exchange cause of the constant price change. Now I have to pay more to reorder.
2	Got to admit, I was taken in by the "hot" words like ergonomic and aesthetic. But it leaks. A valve isn't supposed to leak, but the female connector is not seated against the body--see picture. Thus with garden hose type pressure, water easily blows by washer and sprays out from ahead of the connector.
2	I ware x-large in all of my shirts but these are really tight. Hope they don't shrink in the wash!
2	These shoe trees have a nice quality and cedar aroma but they left deep indentations in my expensive heels. In addition, the appear to be a little too large at the toes. I wear a women's size 8
2	As I am familiar with this brand, from growing up in Nebraska ( where it is made), I was really excited that my husband ordered it. The cheese flavor is great, but sadly, that’s not enough to save it from being way too salty 🙁.
2	These plants are not very full at all. The one I have is from Costco and about 20 years old and there is absolutely no comparison. . Was thinking because of the price and reviews that the would be awesome but not at all and the plant is not doublesided so if you have a wall ledge and want it to flow on both sides this plant will not work.. Also can see the pot and don't like that. Very disappointed..
2	It's very cute and looks just like the picture but it broke off of the chain after only a few months of use and I didn't jerk it. The fan doesn't have a wall switch and therefore requires the chain to function. It's probably fine if you don't pull the chain very often.
2	The mic doesn't work very well. The ear buds and external speakers are fine.
2	I used to love my Versa and I still do but I was on vacation 2 weeks ago and the Fitbit fell apart! Out of nowhere the glass portion came out of the holder that touches your wrist! I superglued it back in but ever since the battery sucks! It used to hold a full charge for about a week but now I have to charge it every 2-3 days. I haven’t even had it for a year and it’s already falling apart. Almost regretting this Versa
2	This type of case probably offers the highest level of protection of both the display AND body of your Apple Watch. Unfortunately, because there is hard plastic between your fingers and the actual display, touch responsiveness is SEVERELY impacted. I have tested the case out for over two weeks and have decided I just can’t live with the unresponsiveness, and am now looking for another solution. I find myself actually reaching for my iPhone to reply to a message after making several attempts to dictate a response on my watch and it not recognizing my touch. This is disappointing, because I really like the protection the case provides. Pretty sure my watch would have already been cracked without it.
2	I had to return this because it didn’t work upon arrival. I have an exact replica of this clock that I purchased several years ago that is still operational but I wanted another for another location. The clock mechanism on this unit felt cheap and brittle in comparison and (as I said) it didn’t work when it arrived.The thermometer and humidity gauge appeared accurate which is the reason for 2 stars, however I wouldn’t recommend the product.
2	Several of the "diamonds" fell out of the prongs and I could not get them to stay again. Also, the ink cartridges inside the pens seems to slip inside and you can barely see the tip of the ink point to write anything. Overall, they are really cute when they arrive but they quickly fall apart.
2	Product was easy to install and looked as I expected, the plastic was cheap and cracked after a few days, I suppose to due to heat?
2	I bought this exact item several years ago and was surprised by how strong the magnets were in it. I purchased another of the same thing (or so I thought) recently for more key storage, but the magnets in this one are mediocre. The same pair of keys that the seemingly identical cloud magnet I already had held up with no problem fell off of the new one very easily. It can barely hold up any pair of keys if they have something slightly heavy attached, like a car key fob. Luckily I still have my existing one, but this new one I sadly can only use for lightweight keys.
2	It was not what I expected. I need lots of soothing and anti friz. This does not have it.
2	I dislike how small this was, bought a medium. I'm 5'9 and weigh 160. I recommend anyone who buys this to go a size up!
2	Very small!!! And only takes a tiny light bulb. It’s cute but not a bargain for the price
2	The device itself works great. I bought it to help keep a check on an elderly parent from roaming. The sensor that lets you know a door has opened is so sensitive to failure that just putting the back on it after activating it can break the sensor so it won't work. The sodering that makes it work is so fragile and impossible to repair if it does break. I've already spent money to replace one broken sensor and it lasted all of about 3 days. Again, it works great, but be very careful on setting it up or replacing the batteries because thats when it breaks.
2	I just wanted it for the steps turned all the other options off and I cant get the battery to last 24 hours. It said up to 5 days. So I was expecting at least 24 hours.
2	I usually get store brand cups. This is the first time I have tried out Hefty and I am not happy. They are super thin and crack very easily.
2	I really liked these bottles with their great labels and printing on the glass. But after a little over a month with normal use (spraying counters to clean) the nozzle split from the neck and started leaking all over when in use. It’s a pretty simple design so I don’t understand how this went wrong. Wish they held up cause I would’ve loved them.
2	Too big. Broke within months of use.
2	This is evidently my fault for not closely looking at the size of the pan. I saw it as an add on item and when a skillet is less than $4, not sure what I was expecting - but it really really wasn't this skillet. When I took it out of the box, I thought Amazon had made a mistake and sent me a Barbie skillet. I am sure it will be durable as I don't see that it has any use. It will be easy to clean as it will never need to be washed. Versatile - maybe as a heavy duty bug swatter.
2	I love to get great deals and most of the time I can fix or modify the product to work. Bent metal no biggie part that's broken then if can fix great but sometimes. This one I'm sad .. parts missing and plastic cracked doesnt leak but still. So cant dat much for the way it came but I'm sure as always I will figure a way or just trash it.
2	It went on okay , they tend not to stay on. Im trying the liquid now
2	This is a nice baffle - if you don't live in a windy locale. Like other reviewers show, this product just shatters on a windy day. It's an expensive lesson. Had to throw it away as I purchased it 3 months ago.
2	Packaging case opened and handle was torn off. I am most upset about the coloring being far off. This is more of a grey brown, very light and muted brown. Not a tan khaki. This is the color of an ashy brown person. Less saturated.
2	We bought this and it didn't fit, so did our Amazon return....they shipped it back to contact seller, who wants us to ship it back at cost to us. So this thing will now be shipped FOUR times!
2	Seemed like a good buy, but broke off in less than a month after routine use. Spend a few extra bucks and get a sturdier one
2	So the picture that is posted is not the same as the product. It does not come down past the wrist like the picture shows. I have included pictures of my own of how the product fits. My thumb didn’t exactly fit in the glove either. Fingers aren’t long enough for my hand. I ended up giving them to my dad since he has smaller hands then I. They are very gripping and work well with touch screens. Going to order the large size to get the length in the fingers and hopefully won’t regret it.
2	Incorrect sizing. A large is a snug fit. The collar is tight. Not comfortable to wear. The only thing is that it looks like the photo.
2	Cannot see Out of mask, probably trip with such a small viewing holes
2	It worked well when it did work, but now, I turn it on and the blue light just stays on and never turns to red to indicate the heating element is on. I will have to take it apart to see what's wrong....
2	Ordered French Vanilla, package arrived quickly but immediately noticed a problem. The package contained 6 English Toffee containers. There’s like 4 stickers around this thing that says English Toffee and 1 French Vanilla but no one caught it. Oh well, arranged for a replacement because I didn’t want English Toffee. Specifically told them that I was sent the wrong product. Guess what....sent me the wrong product again. Same issue. So now I have 12 containers of English Toffee.....and still no French Vanilla. So, as far as my review of the product....it’s based on the English Toffee.... I mean I figured I might as well try it since I had so many and undoubtedly someone felt I really needed it instead of what I ordered. ;) It blended well and price was comparable to what I could find locally when I could find it in stock. Flavor was ok but that may be a little biased because I really wanted French Vanilla and don’t prefer English Toffee.
2	Fit was ok, disappointed with material. Looked cheap, has an ugly polyester look. I returned it.
2	Beautiful but does not work. Came with one plug that does not work well. It may light after several minutes. I tried touching the plug in the outlet and sometimes that works. This has been such a disappointment.
2	Durable and flexible, but does not fast charge my Galaxy S8.
2	Unfortunately i could not get over the smell of this product. I was hoping for a very citrus like smell. I didn't get the citrus smell. However, the product did not burn or irritate my skin. Which is amazing because i have the most sensitive skin.
2	No such thing as 2 day prime more like 5 day shipping
2	I ordered a size medium and they sent a size large. I missed the window for return as life gets busy so now I’m stuck with pants that are way too big.
2	Looks good but the tape just doesn’t hold. In this Texas heat and wind-they are coming off. Needs better two-sided tape.
2	I have a 2500 sq ft home and this router could not provide full coverage to my home. I even purchased the NetGear WiFi extender to see if I could extend my coverage. My router was located upstairs, and the extender was downstairs. The extender could barely connect to my router. I had to move the extender closer to the middle of my downstairs living room in order for it to connect to the router. The whole package for the router and extender was over $500. For $500, you would think these two devices would create a nice mess network. Definitely not worth the price! I ended up giving them to my son who has a 1400 sq ft home and it worked fine for him. Ended up reconnecting my ASUS RT-AC88U and ASUS RT-AC68U routers which create a nice messed network and provides full coverage where I can run multiple HD cameras over WiFi with no problem.
2	My expectations were higher. The app definitely needs improvement. It crashes sometimes and can be really slow
2	The battery package was not in tack; batteries fell out of the package when it was removed from the mailing envelope (which was a white business envelope).
2	drivers side mat moves needs to be bolted to the floor.
2	Very bright, but it fell off my back pack on the first ride.
2	This doesn't stay in place on low pile carpeting. I researched extensively a chair pad that would not move around on my carpet. This one has spikes and is advertised as the correct item for medium pile carpet. Well I found it slips out of position within a matter of minutes and buckles up against the desk and credenza. I have now purchased two different chair pads both advertising they are the ones for medium pile carpet and they both move almost immediately once a chair with roller wheels is moved across them.
2	Extremely larger than regular size and when it was washed the black dye ran into my other clothes..alot of black dye...Disappointed.
2	I was hoping the 2x coverage ment that it would cover finished wood well, but it does not. The texture of the finished wood leaves the grain unpainted. I tried 3 coats to get the basic coverage needed, which is not economical or time saving. Might be best for plastic or metal painting. Won't buy again.
2	Bought Aug. 14th 2018. Worked just fine until Oct. 20th 2018 when it would no longer recognize my 2s LiPo batteries. Unfortunately last return date was Sept. 13th 2018. If you get this I recommend spending a few extra bucks to get the extended warranty. I'm out $50.00 + bucks and without a way to charge my 2s batteries.
2	It's not what I expected to be. I wouldn't say that I don't recommend it since it's not for me. It is also not bright enough.
2	4 nice plastic luggage tags, but missing 3 of the 4 steel loops to attach them to my luggage. Hole in the bag and the fell out before shipping.
2	The pigeons would sit on my roof mocking the owl.
2	Second kit with leaking check valve. SoClean needs to fix this problem.
2	Definitely a waste of money, two out of the three that we put on our phones have already lost stickiness/keep coming off the phone, and one completely just broke after a day of use.
2	The surface of the smaller roller came pitted or damaged. It's not a smooth surface by any means and it's not something I want to use on my face.
2	I've been using these daily to open and close the curtains and they're already falling apart after only a few months.
2	Hardly used...had it for a few months...the bottom two rows of LEDs are flashing and flickering...Light is now useless unless I want a headache
2	the site glass leaked
2	Not sure how I feel about this computer just yet. The key board that came with the package was only half functional. Literally only half the key board would type and the monitor has lines going up and down it. Haven’t decided if I am going to return it yet or not. I had an extra monitor and key board so I wasn’t too upset but I haven’t spent enough time on the computer to see if it’s worth keeping. I will write another review when I do.
2	One side of my watchband was defective and would not attach to my iwatch
2	When you rub your finger on them it's so soft, but it's a different story when on the face. Eats my powder and barely spreads the liquids. Handle is very flimsy. Don't put the smaller brushes anywhere near your eyes, it's like sandpaper
2	The clothing is stitched poorly and the material started to unravel. My rating is generous one.
2	little too small in size
2	Have owned these slippers before and they were sooooooooo comfy. This pair were very stiff and uncomfortable. Not nearly as soft as my original pair. Very difficult to walk in.
2	Item came as described but broke after using it for 3 weeks
2	This did nothing for me but maybe I didn't take it long enough? I have moderate anxiety and unfortunately have only found a few natural alternatives that help me in only the slightest bit. Mindfulness has helped me the most. I would suggest learning to meditate or getting a mindfulness book before trying to take any pills/supplements for anxiety.
2	My phone will no longer connect via bluetooth. I am able to connect to other bluetooth devices, but this was was not found.
2	I was shipped the wrong headphones
2	The straps are legit. The screws are horrible. Two broke while installing. I wouldn’t trust them. If you buy some better screws you ,hopefully, will be fine.
2	These are probably the worst cords I have ever bought. I was intrigued by the combination of sizes and the price, but it has been slightly over a month and they are all dead.
2	This did not do so well in the washer... had to purchase a new one
2	i sit 2 feet away from this fan and i feel nothing. I threw both away
2	My light part for not work ... So I don't even know what a light photo box look like. But I do know what a photo box without a light look likes. Then I'm really not feeling the backgrounds..
2	Doesn't fit into the slider rail. Sizing wrong and too stiff...not flexible.
2	although it locks will come lose without key
2	Love the jacket, but the zipper was broken when delivered.
2	Read reviews of book in NYT and other outlets which led me to think this would be a wonderful, insightful read. It was not! It was very awkwardly written, there were far too many meaningless characters to try to keep track or and little interesting character development. Most of the characters seemed more like stereotypes than real people. A major disappointment.
2	The material is nice, so I give it two stars. I ordered large for my brother, it even hard to fit me who ware woman's Medium.
2	I’m so very disappointed...I only got thru a 1/3 of the story. I thought it was going to be about Scotland...maybe even time travel. It took place in a little town in Texas. There were too many crazy characters to keep straight. Sorry just wasn’t for me!
2	The animal has to be very close for this to work, so if perchance it doesn't, you are dog food, as there is no time for plan B
2	This product is falling apart after 2 months of use. Not happy with at all.
2	Haven't even had this case for a week and it's already starting to come apart. Disappointed.
2	The delay in delivery has not been acceptable.
2	While this is good at melting the ice... it is NOT dog paw safe as advertised. So, if you have ice and no plants or pets to worry about, this is a good deal. Otherwise keep looking.
2	Would not stay on my case, and I had to add double sided tape to get it to stay put. But it's very cute.
2	The bar is way too long. The bar on one of them was bent. Overall very cheap quality.
2	Although the color option is great, the fit is small. If your buying these for a bigger male, or someone that like larger frames/lens then these will not be a good fit.
2	The pendant is very small that you cannot see the inscription o it
2	I ordered this for pictures and quickly realized the colors are way darker than the stock photo. My daughters have mustard yellow dresses and what looks yellow is bright orange in person.
2	Very pretty but the tablet didn’t work when this cover was on. We looked for any obvious issues but there was absolutely no reason why the Samsung tablet wasn’t working inside this cover.
2	Didn’t like the taste at all. I was really excited for the cinnamon roll ones, but they seem to have a very odd taste. I’m not sure if mine are spoiled or what, but I was so excited for them, but unfortunately didn’t live up to my expectations
2	was browning already
2	It's a super cute print but it's literally just a thin print on a white band. I've had it for about 2 weeks and the print had worn off on most of it already.
2	What wedding planner doesn’t know the names of the bride and groom going into being interviewed for the job? So, for me, this book was just a huge mess from the start. I found it unbelievable, with characters that didn’t engage me, and with an epilogue that capped my rating at two stars, because if nothing else, the writing, editing, and grammar were okay.
2	This fits very loosely. Will need some kind of silicone or something to hold it in.
2	Bought the Ultra for my husband and it worked great. Bought these for the face strips, but it doesn't do much except leave his face dry. If I had tried these first, probably wouldn't have considered this brand again. If these don't work for you, try the Ultra. They are so much better and leave skin looking healthy and clean.
2	I was excited about getting these, but now I can't get them to connect to my iPhone. Can anyone help?
2	It protects from scratches but soon as I dropped my phone on a hard surface the protector fell off. Even after that it wasn't reusable. WASTE OF MONEY!
2	cute but smaller than I wanted...
2	This cushion feels great when you first sit on it but then it gets uncomfortable from squishing down so much that it's just not so cushy anymore. OK for short sitting periods. Horrible for long bouts of sitting.
2	The flower straws look a little cheap.. does not look like the picture. I was a little disappointed.
2	A bit too voluminous and overwhelming for me - I'm 5'3 and the skirt ended up feeling like a big bag. Returned.
2	I would not recommend this waffle maker for someone looking to add an appliance to their kitchen that will stand the test of time. The plates are hard to clean and the temperature/ readiness of the maker is somewhat inconsistent. The lid does not open far enough to stay open when when trying to get the waffle out of the maker. It does not come with a waffle spatula either, which would be very helpful. This appliance is college dorm quality at best.
2	I have quite a bit (pun intended) of experience with other impact bits I purchased here on Amazon. I decided to try these for a change, hoping they will be of better quality, and last longer. But, it turns out the metal quality is not very good, and the torx bit edges wear out very quickly. I already went through 3 of these in 2 days of work, and all 3 lasted significantly less time than other brands I have used in the past.
2	Writing is in poor English. Makes me question the non-toxic claim.
2	Good idea but waterproof seal was broken before I put in the batteries. That part not a great design. The light seems powerful but haven’t used it since putting in batteries and disappointing the seal comes broken out of the box
2	I had high hopes for these undies as they got tons of rave reviews but I have found that these do not wash and wear well and have a factory odor that I cannot get rid of. The elastic is coming out after two washes and I can still smell them literally the entire day I wear them. Being pregnant adding another weird odor is the last thing you want 🤢 Great concept, poor execution.
2	I haven't had this plant very long. It looked ok when I got it, but it is already very wilted. The leaves are starting to turn brown. I'm trying to save it, but I don't have much hope. 2 Stars because it did look ok at first so maybe it's my fault.
2	Falls of its own accord - the shed is not rigid enough to hold the shelf.
2	Super cheap and didnt fit the cable worth a hoot. I would return but would probably cost more than it's worth. Would not recommend
2	Lines too narrow for writing
2	I actually really liked this watch until 1 month in it stopped working/charging. Missed the return day by 2 days. Very disappointed that I spent that much for a watch for one month.
2	It okay, but water goes through it easily.
2	It definitely is not 4.5 inches inside or outside the lip! It was smaller and now the project i was working on doesn't fit since i was expecting it to come in the right size
2	The quality of a Wahl products no longer exist. I use it but it's cheaply made. I guess I got what I paid for.
2	Meh.I use to have My Talking Tom until I watched a video saying that a man was looking at you through Tom's eyes and then I deleted the app
2	The only reason why I give this product a very low scores is because they completely copied the scent off of pink sugar so really they should have said inspired by Pink Sugar because it smells so similar to it and the longevity power of this this product is least to none you have to reapply of course is this giftable I mean yes it's giftable but why not give them the real deal Pink Sugar
2	Extremely disappointing. Did not fit 70% of the compartments and didn’t come with any liners for the backseats where my kids sit- where I really need them. Not worth the $ next time I’ll buy some from Walmart
2	This ball came loose in an Amazon box. No packaging. It was also fully inflated but bounces weirdly. I did the 2/3 test where a ball, fully inflated to the right psi should bounce to 2/3 of the height it is dropped from. This thing has weird dead spots where it barely bounces. The grip is also very sticky but not in a good way. 2 stars awarded because I won't feel bad using a brand new ball outdoors anymore.
2	This is not good for my car seat it just goes straight down and doesn’t hang for baby to see. However she does like the toy.
2	They are fine unless it is cold outside. I live in northern Minnesota and we haven't even gotten below zero yet and my fingers are burning with cold. I put knit gloves underneath them and it still doesn't help. I wish I would have saved my money for something better.
2	What I like: light weight. Build-in USB. What I don't like: 1-The build-in USB is hard to put back into the body slot after use. I had to wriggle it couple of times to get it in. 2- Power bank failed to charge my phone after 5 months. (it get charged 100% , but won't charge to phone, I had to wriggle the USB when plugged into the phone, sometimes it will make the connection, more than often...it doesn't.
2	Balls seem like ok but you actually only get 150 balls in the bag not 200.
2	This mini RC truck plays just like the larger scale trucks. I was a little worried about the speed but I have to say for the size it is plenty. This truck is fun for kids or adults and is surprisingly tough. The fun lasted for about a day. After a few charges it doesn’t seem to work. It will charge, show full charged and that is where the good news stops. The truck takes off full throttle without the controller being pressed in reverse and then when I press the throttle it stops. The manufacturer seemed willing to swap for a replacement but looking at the costs associated with having to ship it back to the manufacturer for repair/ replacement just wasn’t worth it as I was too busy to get to the PO. I didn’t find it fruitful to spend the cost of a new product to ship this back. At this point it is a paper weight in my garage. The electronics in this truck seem to be junk but on a positive it does look cool. Lesson learned, same money and buy better. Seems the build quality is either hit or miss based on the reviews.
2	They are cheap. The teeth on them are so small the don’t grab onto the metal to hold down the ladder rack
2	Looked scary but could not figure out how to move around easily.
2	Headlights were professionally installed and adjusted. I find they are very dull. I have to use high beams at all times. Miss my old headlights.
2	Was not even close to the color blue advertised. Wanted a neon blue for summer toe polish and it's not even close to that. It's a dull baby blue or dull sky blue. It's hideous.
2	If you plan to use this candle for candling eggs to sell save your money. They cup is way to small to be able to twirl the egg to look for blood or meat spots.
2	I only had two screen protectors in the box. I used the white guide case and when I went to press the corners down the bottom left corner cracked. The screen protector was longer than the white guide case so I just put my last one on without the guide case but now I don’t have any extra ones.
2	Our 4th grade son loves Fort Nite and loved the look of this backpack; unfortunately after using if for only 2 weeks the main compartment zipper came apart. This is after we babied it because the zipper kept separating after being zipped closed, so we would have re zip until it would seal. The company told us we could keep the backpack and receive a 40% refund (what can you really do with a broken backpack?) or return it (at our cost) to receive the full refund. So just because of the principle of the whole thing we did return it for a refund, which we have been told we will receive in a few days.
2	I can see how this would be an amazing product for someone with smaller needs... but for a DDD there was no support and I had to return it.
2	Seems like a quality product, however, did not cover the scrape on my chair.
2	Lasted less than a year. Plugged in one night to charge iPhone and next morning when I woke up Phone was dead. No charge was made and I was not going to have my phone ready for work. I tested on another iPhone to see if Battery issue was the case. Same thing; no charge at all.
2	It was much smaller than I anticipated. Waste of money. Don't purchase
2	Returned. Looked like a potato sack
2	Find a hanger with some no skip fabric or something that will not allow cloths to slip off so easily. Would not buy anymore of these. 12 is enough.
2	It works once you finally get it installed. No mounting screws and zero instructions. A template or some kind of instructions should be included with the item.
2	Far off on the color.... it's very red where as the photo showed a dull redish brown.
2	I wanted to recommend these because of the super cute designs but I do not recommend these at all. They feel very very thin, and they rip so easily!!!! Will not be buying these again.
2	These tend to not vacuum well after a few of them have been run through my Food Saver. The textured side tends to smooth out when put against the heat strip and then the machine won't vacuum the air out. Pay more and use the actual Food Saver bags.
2	Looks a lot better in pictures
2	This is an amazing product..... When it works. Going through countless updates for drivers and re-installations the wireless card has been working well for about three weeks until it started to stop working as well. Dropping connection and refusal to connect to specific WiFi's or just flat out not working, this seems to be one of the worst gadgets to deal with. Looking at the support only gives directions to reinstall drivers and/or remove and reinstall. Look into another product instead of buying this $100+ Tech toy
2	This backpack isnt comfortable at all, the amount of friction leaves a painful burning feeling on the inner front side of your shoulders and the straps are obnoxiously huge and get in the way thay you cant even move properly.
2	I like the product...it could be better...isn't as strong as the advertisement make it...would I purchase this again...probably not....
2	Product was missing the mounting hardware. It seems to be a decent vise otherwise.
2	well made but they keep falling off not enough velcro lose 1 a day
2	"No assembly required" ?? Difficult to assemble as tabs do not line up well and even after many full blows with a rubber hammer they would not insert properly - even after drawing in with supplied self tapping screws. Step must be placed 1 1/2" - 2" away from spa to allow step to open. None of the material on web or assembly instructions says that it is "Not Intended for Chemical Storage" Disappointed with product
2	these are either too thin or too thick and get stuck in the small gap between the surface and side of my air hockey table
2	Would have like it if it didn’t run so small
2	Two out of four of these bulbs work flawlessly, two of them seem to function only intermittently. According to my hub the same Two bulbs only respond about 40% of the time and when they do turn on, for some reason they are set at 10% brightness and I have to increase the brightness to 100%
2	I have had these slippers for less than one month and had to go buy different ones. The fabric started to rip and there isn’t really any support. I am disappointed with this purchase!
2	As another reviewer pointed out, this is a LOW PRESSURE hose despite the text on the package. The package drawing even shows it on the low pressure side of the regulator. The hose has no markings, so I have no idea where the pressure ratings in the advertisement came from. I see no certifications anywhere, so definitely don't trust it. Package images attached.
2	makes hair too stiff
2	I've eaten this cereal since I was little. something major changed in the flavor since the last time I ordered.
2	After using these for several months they started making a very loud buzzing sound. While still under warranty, no reply to the email I sent the seller. They sound very good when they worked.
2	This mask is just like pictured. The 2 🌟 is because of the horrible smell. When my son wear it you can smell the chemicals. I want to trash it but he loves it so much.
2	The two stars are for the mouse pad. He curls up and is not as comfortable to use and the rest pad for the keyboard. The keyboard pad is perfect the mouse pad could use some serious design work
2	Not very easy to use...,
2	Cheap, flimsy tops. 3/4 of them were dented, scratched.
2	The clasp on the band is way too bulky and clashes. Otherwise it is solidly built and looks alright but huge stitches and looks pretty cheap.
2	I have used this shaker quite a few times after purchasing it. For the most part it does its job, but when shaking it to mix protein powder, the powder tends to clump in the deep ridges on the side. Depending on the type of powder you have, no amount of shaking will loosen it. Which in turn makes it harder to clean as well.
2	Broke within 10 minutes of play.
2	They ripped literally as soon as I put them on, not true to size at all. WAAAAYYYYY TO SMALL and the material was so fragile and thin. Do not recommend
2	Don't think I even finished watching it...can't remember. Either it sucked and I turned it off, fell asleep, or it wasn't memorable at all.
2	Not the same product as shown. Plastic twist cap with plastic thread.
2	I'm 5'7" 150 lbs, wear a size 34 B or C, size 8 shirt, and size 10 pants. I tried this bra in both of my usual bra sizes and it dug into the the flesh at the outer edge of my breast toward under my arm. This must have something to do with the size and shape of my breasts, but I'll tell you, I could not keep this bra on for more than a minute.
2	Used in for a little more than a month before it sprung from my waste as a disassembled mess.
2	6 capsules for one serving not the best deal
2	I just bought the Pixel 3XL and the charge on this is slow.
2	Very thin and watery. I normally use Kristen Esse, which is thick and requires only a small amount to do my hair. This product, however, comes out of the dispenser almost liquid and not like a REAL mousse. Makes me think this product is a fake.
2	I found this tub pretty ineffective for an infant. It doesn’t fit into my sink so it didn’t work for me, measure yours if that’s what you’re buying it for. As for the toddler part, we will have to see.
2	Front of my book was ripped and it went through 6 pages
2	Sent back because they were too small.I was so excited about them, but they just didn't fit. I'm normally a small so I ordered a small, should have ordered a medium or a large.
2	The desk itself is ok. Good for the money. Easy to assemble. The packaging, however, was horrible. The box arrived with both ends open and parts of the desk hanging out. I opened the package the rest of the way and it looked like nothing missing, so I put it together. Because of the shoddy packaging, there were serious dings and dents in a couple of places. I'm keeping the desk because I need it and don't want to wait for another -but am quite unhappy to have a brand new desk with dents and dings.
2	After five days of use counter quit working and had to buy a driveway sensor off a friend because it was shipped without one, I contacted seller but they gave me the run around so it was easier to just buy one off my friend, but it works good no thanks to seller
2	Despite being very well packaged, the screw that you mount the paper-towel rod on was visibly crooked so you couldn't thread the rod on it. We fixed it but the screw almost broke in the process. Screw not removable so if it would have broke, the item would be useless. Can't complain given the price, just warning others.
2	Shirt is ok. I ordered it in green and the one sent is more of a dark gray with a blue tint. Would have given 5 stars if they sent the right item.
2	I did not show up in my garden
2	Used them for a little more than 10 times. We have been gentle on them, but one fiberglass tube broke recently, which makes it hard to use.
2	I will keep them but not sure if I’ll buy them again
2	Unfortunately it fits great except in the shoulders and upper arm....way too tight
2	I was expecting a shampoo that smelled like ROSE!
2	This picture is very pretty however the drills are not shiny and are poor quality
2	Never dissolves in my washer on first try, while I don't find this an issue with other grocery store brands
2	My kindergarten classroom but only adults sharpened pencils with it. It would turn off after about a year and now only works randomly and will cut off as soon as you begin to sharpen.
2	Not very good quality. Its clumpy and thick. :(
2	This product ships fast but it is not the best light for my fog light the light is very scattered and does not provide the clean cut off as my halogen. They are more of a decorative nature than functional one. i am going to look for another product. i gave a 2 star because of the shipping speed.
2	It’s clunky. The battery lasts less than a full 24 hour period. The app is weak. There is nothing I like about it.
2	The strap cannot not be placed vertically in the middle of the bag as the design does not allow the ends to be separated. (See attached picture) In addition you must have very good strength in your hands to open the clasp. It is attractive.
2	Too small for what I wanted them
2	The characters were nicely developed. But the story line was not thrilling or shocking. It was just weird. Some of the plot was predictable. The ending where all the answers come together...was far fetched and a bit unbelievable. This book is just OK.
2	Screws keep coming out and chair is already chipped my grandson fell off of it and the chair fell on its side and notice the chip
2	This product is okay, but definitely not what I was expecting. The support it gave to my back felt nice, but I only wore it for about an hour because the product is extremely short!! I’m only 5’4 and the product did not cover my torso that much, very disappointing. In addition I ordered above what size I should’ve for some room since I really want back support more than weight loss. I ordered an XL, but my waist measurement was in the L bracket, yet it was very short. I have pretty a curvy body already, this product did make me look more curvy but because of the length it was super unflattering
2	These don’t taste very good. I hoped for a more lemony taste but it just tastes like a sugar coating. I won’t buy them again. Disappointed in the bar.
2	I have no idea where all the cardboard inserts go and when I try to unzip the inside zippers the zippers don't fully close or open properly and most of the zippers just fell right off. The exterior is nice and it's quite large but it is terribly made. No instructions were provided either.
2	Thankfully they came in a 4 pack. I like them, especially because I have 4 kids, so my hands are always full and I can't afford to break my phone. However these were the reason I switched to a Popsocket, after the ring is turned around and pulled out then put flat so many times, it would just break off.
2	Do yourself a favor...go buy some real ginger root and use a grater!! I have used capsules from this company before with good results. But this bottle of capsules gave me pain in my intestinal tract and throat within a half hour of each dose...no matter how much water I drank to take them with. Recently I was having a particular bad digestive day after eating out. I took 1 pill 4 times within the day. That night I woke up with frightening gnawing pain (like before only way worse)...in my stomach and chest. I went out later and bought some real ginger root in the produce section of my grocery store...made some ginger tea and added some to my meals...and BINGO...best idea I ever had. The trouble with capsules is you never know what you are actually getting...but with real food it’s hard to deny!
2	Never unsealed the cork, but after a couple of months it is filled with contaminated growth of some sort.
2	Got this super cute Minnie inspired diaper bag to replace our last that simply was too big and bulky for everyday use. I love how much you can fit into this bag without it being sooo big. It was two smaller pockets that work great for cellphone or other things you might not want to be digging through the larger pocket for. My daughter and I love Minnie Mouse so that’s why I purchased. The straps are kind of funny but they’re still comfortable . Definitely worth the price. *UPDATE* those funny straps I was talking about. Yeah, one broke today. Returning.
2	These worked really well at first. All of our devices were charging quickly. After approximately two months they have all stopped charging all of our devices.
2	Two of the cables gave out after a couple of months. Like the length and thickness of cable.
2	Nice sturdy looking but I've had 2 go bad already
2	The seed packet come in with other item and doesnt cover or protect at all . You can know it is seed and easy to get defective if not cover and protect correctly.
2	I only received a paid of sunglasses. All the pictures show a case and a cloth and many other items but I only got a pair of the sunglasses.
2	Unfortunately one of the glasses was broken when they arrived. I'm very disappointed
2	very narrow and cheaply made.
2	Product has defects.
2	This is a total rip off!! These bags are so small and are only filled 1/2 filled with product. For $9 there should be WAY more product. SAVE your money and do not buy this.
2	Not so good at marking, even on white clothes. I have to print in large letters even with the fine point marker. The ink does not seem to penetrate well.
2	You get what you pay for
2	For the cost and other reviews, I expected more! I bought this for my husband who gets really bad bumps from his razor. But he normally uses another product but I wanted him to try this one bc of all the great reviews. He said it stings quite badly and it did NOT clear his razor bumps nearly as quickly as his other (much cheaper one) that he uses. I will not purchase this again unfortunately. It does smell nice though.
2	Bad quality since when microphone is connected it has a noise. Other than that it is good.
2	Love the light pink. The band looks & feels just like the one that came with my fitbit. But it only lasted about 2 weeks before it was stained and dirty looking even after I cleaned it. Maybe a darker color would have been better.
3	It's a very nice kit, it came with all the accessories, BUT my waterproof case was broken, the thing that closes it was broken so I can't close the case and now the case is useless. And I bought this kit just because of the waterproof case.... The rest was fine as announced.
3	I think the suitcase and backpack are very cute however, it’s been a little over a month since it was as bought and the suitcase lining inside already has a ripe in it. Not happy about that. We have used the suitcase 2 times only.
3	Ok for price, don't last too long for me.
3	Just ok. A lot of similar colors
3	I think it is really pretty, but I am worried about the strength and if it will really protect well if I drop my phone. My husband says that he thinks it will be fine but I don't know. The screen protector doesn't cover the entire screen but 95% of it. I think that I will be looking for another case that I feel more confident in it protecting my phone.
3	It does look like the picture but it isn't great quality, construction paper and glitter letters. You also have to string it yourself. I probably should have made it myself.
3	Only 1 of the 2 will stay attached to the vent. The other falls every time I turn a corner or apply the breaks too hard.
3	This deodorant smells terrific and does not cause irritation. However it also clumps up entirely, causing it to just rub itself into my shirts rather than stay on my arm pits. Also it doesn't provide any sweat blocking. This would be good for someone who shaves their armpit hairs or wears baggy clothes.
3	The odor was very strong. I aired it outside. I still haven't used it but after 5 month it doesn't smell it so I can use it
3	Smaller than expected but overall seems okay.
3	I searched high and low for a pair of size 4 toddler rain boots, but most brands started at size 5. So, I was so excited when i found these and thought they would be perfect for my daughter. However, they're actually BIGGER than the size 5's I already have for her. Now I have 2 pairs for her to grow into, but none for her to wear now.
3	These bands are too thick and color was very unnatural. Gold is too yellow.
3	I was expecting 100 large whole pig ears and got some like that, but alot that were not.. Would not buy from them again unless they change this.
3	I love this product so much i bought it twice! But their customer service is TERRIBLE. I received the second glassware broken and did not receive a response for one week and STILL have not heard from anyone to receive my refund. I received it on time, but am not happy at the moment.
3	Nice rack--didn't fit my cross members
3	Now that it is installed, it's a good mount. But the lower pipe arrived with the pin holes misaligned, preventing the pin from going through, thereby preventing it from connecting. It took many hours of work to take apart the lower section and realign it. QC is lacking and instructions were subpar as well. Still, if you have the patience to figure it out, it's a good value
3	Reason why I’m giving 3 stars is because the hats are a bit uncomfortable since the bow is a bit bulky in the inner part... but they look cute overall and keep her warm. Also the sewing seems like it’s a bit defective but we will see how long they hold.
3	Only one of the locks works.
3	Looking for love may led to healing
3	For some reason, a signature was required to have a poster delivered...mind-boggling. Anyway, I'm sure it's really nice and exactly what I want, maybe I'll actually see it early next week?
3	While the order was delivered on time, the packaging was open and missed all erasers. The only reason I did not returned it back that I had an order for additional erasers, but be careful what you are shipping. So, it is probably more to the packing department not the product itself, but I am not happy receiving open/damaged packaging.
3	Poor quality! This wouldnt stay inflated.
3	Have not notice a difference
3	Carb did come damaged/bent on the intake side of the casing. Choke cable was different and required modifications, throttle cable guide was different and also need modifications. Idle was also different than OEM. In all took a few hours to get it to fit and have it work correctly. 3 stars for it working once modified to fit.
3	A size smaller than normal. Poorly sown. Seams rip easily. The left leg is significantly smaller than the right.
3	I like the size of this cup and it does keep my drinks cold, BUT the opening for the straw is too large and my drink would splash out of the cup. I bought this to take to the gym, but after a week I had to find another cup because you can’t carry it in a gym bag and if it rips over on the floor, your drink will splash out from the top all over the place. Total bummer!
3	There are a lot of flaws compared to Chamber of Secrets, but still worth playing. It would've been so much better if they had taken out the troll bosses though
3	My fiance LOVES his skeletool... until his blade broke in less than a wk & I'm having a hard time finding replacement blades. Leatherman is supposed to be high quality & would have gotten 5 stars (bc my fiance uses it daily) but I'm not happy about the blade...which is pretty much the point of this tool.
3	nowhere near as pretty as picture
3	This lasted me about 1.5 years until it stopped charging. It lit up but my phone was losing charge. When it worked it was good. You do have to push the charger in and I can see some looser sockets not working and sliding out. Worked in my 2009 Hyundai Sonata.
3	Great set but Gk has weak teeth and the spinning plate on revolve falls off easy I lost mine but aside from that galaxy Zeus is one of the best stock combos ever
3	Lots of accessories. Had to find a plastic box to hold all the stuff. The plastic box the cameras is in, doesn't have a bottom once you open it, so its just a recycle. "user manual" in very small print, hard to read. Would be nice to have a link to a real manual. Hard to identify pieces and what they are for. No information on usage. Can't say if it works or not, as the memory cards (I ordered separately) haven't come yet. Took a while, bu I figured out how to open the box, and the camera.
3	Only lasts about 4 to 5 hours total.
3	These do not deal so the leak easily
3	No as good as I would of liked, bends really easy while cleaning teeth..
3	It didn't fit and wasn't accessible for my injectors...
3	Works as advertised.
3	The opening is very small and the suction is not very good honestly I prefer to use my Plastic one from the dollar store at least it sucks LOL
3	It's been difficult to get thru this book... story interesting but the writing is not so good
3	I did end up breaking out from this deodorant, so I don't use it anymore. It also stains clothes.
3	I’ve had other mattress pads that are waterproof, and this one feels like plastic. Not a huge fan.
3	This is pretty wimpy as far as diffusers go but it’s really pretty and has a wide range of colors. It only runs a few hours with 5-6 drops of oil. Better for a smaller room
3	I get the impression that I wasn't the target audience? I don't know, this felt like a well made direct to DVD sort of movie. Had I watched it on Netflix or maybe the Included with Prime section I wouldn't have felt as cheated. Nice but not terrible or wonderful in any aspect. On a scale of "I want my time back" to "Dude you need to see this" I give this a solid "Meh!".
3	The product is fine. I've been eating these since I was eight and I'm now 50 (they don't make them like they used to but they're still not terrible). The main issue was the massive wait for shipping. Granted, I was notified that the shipping would take longer than usual, but the overall wait time was ridiculous. They first missed the estimated date of arrival, then notified me of the wait, THEN they arrived, and when they arrived, they were 10 days (!) from expiration (and if I'm not mistaken, these have a shelf life of about 3 months). The people shipping these need to get it together. Please make sure with the seller first when they are arriving, AND expiring!
3	Firstly, I taste neither "raspberry" nor "lemonade" but instead something more like watermelon and some unknown taste. Very odd. And worse, it coats my mouth in ... something. Is that the stevia? I dunno. Regardless, I'll pass...
3	Cover was gross but the book was fine
3	Good shoe, but it’s not bright white at all. The shoelaces are bright white but the leather is a bit off white and I think this is misleading. Keeping them though because they are comfortable. Not happy with the color.
3	Good lock but could not get it to work
3	I bought the black ones, the stars are a bit more faded that the ones on the picture. They are ok.
3	It came out in a few washes
3	I can see why the price is inexpensive. I received yesterday, expiration date is for sept of this year. No way will we use all of these in that short amount of time. Very deceptive!!!
3	Too bulky and there was a gap behind my infants ears, I’m sure they would have worked okay but I want them to work great!!
3	Not as long as shown on picture
3	We use dog poop bags for our kids poop diapers, helps control a smells in the room. These bags work well, however, these bags do not have any amount of lemon scent as stated in the product title.
3	Doesn't really look that much like Gamora and is not very articulated but is okay.
3	waist too tight - sent for exchange, and all is not good.
3	Doesn’t work if you have another Alexa in the house
3	These shorts are fine for the price, I would have given them 4 stars but instead I give them 3 only because the zipper in on of the pockets broke, not a big deal since I usually don't carry things in my pockets while riding. the fit is good not too tight or too baggy. The adjustable waist is a nice feature.
3	My Frenchie had no problems with the green color. He can hardly wait for his dinner. He’s not a picky eater so he had no issue with the texture or color. He didn’t chew dry kibble so he would always get choked and spit whole pieces up hours later. I switched him to canned food about 2 months ago. I found this food online and it seems to be a healthier option. Update: After about a month, my dog lost interest in this food. He would never walk away from his bowl with food still in it but he started doing that with this food. Unfortunately, the food search continues.
3	Cheap. My own fault for going cheap.
3	Good but very small for adult ears
3	The tiles are very small and feel cheap. They look like what they are, cardboard glued to magnets. I work in the print industry and I could make my own and do a better job.
3	I am on a quest for over the calf socks, am on third brand. These did not stay up all day.
3	Every individual has his own needs, I like the design & feel, but I did not like the thick sides, it becomes bulky & wider for the phone to hold.., I only need minimal protection & to minimize the slippery back.
3	I used this pen a lot on a normal basis. The click mechanism wore out quickly. I would only use it when I needed it and not to fidget with. The pen itself is robust and worked well until the mechanism wore out.
3	I liked the feel of the material, but was a little tight.
3	I had to take in the arms and bodice. My girls are average 5-7 year olds. And they both were to big.other then that there very beautiful the sheer is a tanish color. One of my girls is lighter then the other n you can see the difference.
3	Pretty small balloons. Much smaller then average size party balloon. Only held helium for less than a day.
3	Love it but battery life was Short. Purchased in December and need a replacement battery in March. Otherwise it's ok
3	The top is a bit too cropped for me, but I love the skirt! Not a big fan of showing alot of my stomach. I'm going to switch it up on the top part.
3	Came highly recommended by various kbeauty bloggers and Reddit. I thought it was okay but didn’t blow my socks off.
3	The large mat is nice. It is made up of some kind of very thick felt material. The rolling device is a cheap inflatable device. Sucks for me because my cat found it about 1 week after I got it, poked holes in it, and now I can't store any puzzles
3	I love this spray but one of the bottles had a nozzle that just spurted out the spray and couldn’t be used.
3	Very adorable plants, however don't water from the top, they mold easily, also mine are not growing super fast.
3	Loved the suitcase but it didn’t fit in the carry on container at the airport!!! I bought it specifically to use as a carry on and I was told by United, Belgium airlines, and TAP airlines that I had to check because of the size. Great suitcase if you don’t mind checking the bag, but if you wanna use it as a carry on it doesn’t fit
3	These fit fine and are OK to wear as slipper sox. Too thin for use with Pilates equipment. The reformer was particularly uncomfortable. I had purchased these specifically for Pilates, so I am disappointed. I will still make use of them for other purposes.
3	It’s ok but not as comfortable as I would like. The band is too stiff and I can’t sleep with it. Nice features but I can’t wear all day because the band is bothersome.
3	I have to order a lot of these, because they do not last very long, constantly getting holes in the material, and leaf debris blows through. Also, the zipper does not last for any length of time either. The zipper pull portion that holds tab in place moves and tab becomes free.....eventually it breaks, no pull.......and the zipper also does not fit together and is constantly separating.
3	First cord broke within a week. I guess that’s why they send you 3 at a time. The price is good, especially for 3, and they look really nice, but it’s not really worth it if each cord is only going to last a week.
3	The flavor is ok, but overall is ruined by how powdery it is when you bite it. Doesnt taste great.
3	This material is extremely prone to static charge and the hair clings to it.
3	The ruler and radius gauges are inaccurate. Good enough for a beginner looking to learn basic guitar maintenance
3	This is to hard to hit. Low slowing games are no fun in a video game
3	Loved the material of this suit, the bottoms fit perfect, unfortunately the top has a side boob issue, feeling like if I moved just right I would pop right out on the side without a strap.
3	Very cool color, but I wish it was packaged with more care. The bottle was busted, so it was covered in green dye staining my hands.
3	These feel sturdy, but they are pretty shallow. You wouldn’t be able to drain a lot of noodles or whatever at a time.
3	I’m too fat!! But this dress is cut very nicely. If I were a few pounds lighter, it would be great. So summer look out here I come!! (Diet first)!
3	It's rolled down to about an inch in diameter making it HORRIBLE to try and unroll. It creases, it lifts from the paper, and it's basically impossible to lay flat. The color is good and the reflective capacity is good, only reason for 3 stars.
3	not the greatest quality but it did what it was suppose to do
3	The good: For the price, the quality seems solid and the 9" inseam is a good length. The bad: I'm not sure why these shorts are listed as slim. The leg opening is 11" which is wider than many regular cut shorts and if you have slim legs these pretty much look like you're wearing a skirt.
3	Tried to wear them for 2 days, but my heels were uncomfortable. They are a wee bit to small.
3	Excellent quality to the cover, holds up well and is sturdy. However the frame is a total failure. First wind of only 10 to 15 mph and the frame was bent all out of shape. I replaced the frame with shaped 80 gauge pvc and now works beautifully.
3	Okay product, difficult to shape for good fit, gets really mushy and hard to work with.
3	Table was easy to put together and is very sturdy but it arrived with damage to the finish which I had to repair myself due to time restraints. Otherwise a great product
3	It is good value for the price. But the ipad does not stay in the grooves easily and it often slides out. Perhaps if there was another groove and/or deeper grooves it would be better.
3	Nice color little small not very spacious.
3	The picture is deceiving. image is smaller than what it appears!
3	The cardboard holding it was torn and I was unable to gift it as I needed. :(
3	Looks pretty but very thin cheap metal.
3	Pay attention to measurements because the mugs are tiny. I couldn’t even put a normal sized mug in their place because most of my mugs are 2 tall to fit. Also only holds 10 oz total of water
3	Doesn’t appear to be well-made. The little twirly piece that moves the popcorn kernels inside the pan would get stuck at times. I wasn’t very impressed with it.
3	A terrible item I ever bought. Upset. To be truth, rubbish! Fake product! Pure Junk. This was my worst buy yet.
3	Would be better if they were a bit larger. My collars are still somewhat tight.
3	Just received today. I’ve had the light on high for 3 hours and the wax won’t melt. The bulb isn’t hot enough.
3	So much larger than expected, hard to fit in pockets
3	My first and only cut was an English cucumber. The product does what it says but because it is not as sharp as you would expect your vegetables are not as easy to cut. Also, I guess I should have paid more closely to the dimensions because it is also very small. I am not returning it because it is not worth the effort but will buy one that is longer.
3	Works good, breaks too easy.
3	Drawer organizer is just as pictured but the slide out sides are pretty flimsy and probably won’t last too long.
3	It was very mild/vanilla
3	Plastic housing is of poor finish, for a pricy machine.
3	Probably very comfortable but you will need new sheets with extra deep pockets. I didn't think about that when I ordered. And it's not that easy to get it into another box.
3	They are durable but they came with a super strong smell. I had to put them by the window for 2 days to get it off. This makes me think the material they use is not very safe because they had a strong chemical smell, but I don't wear them all day so I'm not that concerned. They look like the picture and they are comfortable.
3	We have bought two of these. One for each kid. The silicone breaks rather quickly. One was broken in a week and the other one in about 10 days. I would be hesitant to buy this product and search out one of higher quality.
3	Not the best quality, but do the job, once you reinforce with nails and glue.
3	The product works well, nice feel and weight - just a big disappointment that the 'metal' cover on the end that is screwed in was cracked. Returning for a replacement...
3	I really like that they are sheer enough to let in light yet provide privacy. I also like the fabric. however, they are so crooked. I moved them around to fit the best they will, but I sure wonder who hemmed them. I didn't return them as they were inexpensive, and you do get what you pay for. they'll be ok for a temporary curtain.
3	It's not as advertised, you will still need to scrub your panels to get it cleaned otherwise with this alone, it's just like hosing it but adding a coating
3	Coat seemed nice but I think the brand does not use US sizing because it was about 2 sizes too small for what should have fit me. I even went a size up than normal to account for wearing layers under it. I had to return it.
3	Not what I was hoping for, my bearded dragon has a very picky pallet it seems.
3	Warm but not as warm as expected in 22 degree weather out riding atv's. Better than a regular sock though.
3	I really like the design and the feel in my hand. However, there is a huge negative for me: the L and R buttons when using the case is considerably harder to press. I tried flexing the rubber but to no avail. Maybe I'm missing something. I don't know.
3	I read other reviews before I purchased these about some of the wafers arriving broken. I decided to take a chance. Well the first of the four boxes I ordered had a lot of broken wafers I was trying to make the whipped cream dessert recipe on the back of the bos. It is a bit difficult to make with broken wafers but I was able to find a way to make it work. I would probably purchase these again even with the broken wafers because I cannot find these cookies in the store. And, my family would not be happy without the chocolate whipped cream dessert. So what's a girl to do!
3	Funny, not like funny haha but funny. No actually it's mostly funny haha. I received a free copy and this is my voluntary review.
3	The heat doesn't work great, but the message is great.
3	I love the light it gives on my selfies or group pictures. The only thing i hate about it is sometimes the light will just turn on by itself and or blink wildly by itself. I can't control the light sometimes.
3	Thought there was a face protector
3	Good price. We'll see how well they work.
3	difficult to get to and the screw holes don't line up exactly but it works. will get the more expensive one in the future when this breaks
3	These containers are the perfect size and the lid fits the container...which is a problem that I have had when buying a different cheap container. My only complaint is that these are NOT sturdy. Two were completely damaged during transit, even though the packaging was perfectly fine. The containers are made of thin plastic, with very little give. I also dropped one...less than two feet onto the carpet and it cracked it. They are cheap though.
3	I bought this instead of other highly-rated laptop risers because of the adjustable height and angle. However, the adjusted angle would not stay in place over time. I had to keep screwing every few days which is super annoying.
3	I came to this product after having so much trouble finding the Twin Lab chewable calcium citrate. I got the berries and cream flavor. It was good in the beginning when I started to chew, but the more I chewed and it dissolved I started to get a bad taste that continued on to become a bad aftertaste. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s not a bitter taste but it’s certainly not a pleasant taste. Another thing I didn’t like is that each chew has 4 grams of carbs. I need 1500 mg of calcium per day due to Bariatric surgery, so I would be consuming 12 grams of carbs per day. I’m trying to follow a Keto way of eating and would prefer it not to have so many carbs just for a supplement. It has corn syrup and sugar, and then they added Splenda. I guess the aftertaste would be worse if those ingredients weren’t there. I do applaud them for avoiding aspartame. I do like the fact that they used calcium citrate instead of carbonate. I also like the fact that one chew is 500 mg. It has some Vitamin K2 in it as well which is good. I’ll continue to take these until I find a reasonable replacement. I’ll just have to have something ready to eat immediately after these chews to hide the aftertaste. I’ve always had very sensitive taste buds. Probably nobody else can taste what I’m tasting in these.
3	Somewhat short in length
3	Battery run out very fast
3	The product works fine but the squeaking is extremely irritating.
3	You should know that the fabric of the back of this jacket is not the waterproof/windproof material that the front is and is much thinner, which I imagine would be very helpful to evaporate sweat while riding. I could only imagine freezing my sweaty back off on a cold mt. bike ride during a stop to fix a mechanical, so I sent it back.
3	Cell phone holder cracked. Did not drop it. This is the first time it has happened to me
3	These hangers are soooo useful ans space saving. However they are not durable i have had at least 10 of them break out of the pack of 50 i bought les than 1 month ago. They break when you rotate the hook. I wish they were more durable.
3	Not very crisp noise at all, seem cheaply made, but fair for the price.
3	This swing will work for my toddler but there is no way it would work for an older kid or teenager. The plastic is very thin and it seems cheaply made. My baby likes it though. Shipping was fast
3	Great sudsing and cleansing qualities but it’s a huge no on the Early to Rise scent.
3	Had just a bit too much Citrus. Really nice try though.
3	I kept losing WiFi signal from time to time, wired part was good just wifi feature was not satisfying
3	If you have narrow to medium feet, these might work for you. If you have medium to wide, you may not ever get them on. The knit is not stretchable like it looks in the picture. One good thing, once they are actually on, there is plenty of room in the toes, unlike most shoes. Wish I could stretch out the weave. The seller was very accommodating and gave me a refund. Good customer service.
3	The banner is exactly as pictured except for one detail: each letter is sent in a package included with a string and a needle and you have to assemble it yourself. For the price I expected it to be able to just be pulled out of the package and hung up. Luckily I opened the package prior to the party. 3/5 stars because although it accomplishes what I purchased it for, I likely could have made it myself for cheaper, since I’m already playing arts and crafts with this might as well have just made it all.
3	not the best shampoo...overrated
3	I'm 5'5 about 175 lbs and I ordered a large just to be on the safe side but it was a bit big. Will gift this to a friend that will look amazing in it. Overall, pretty dress just a bit hard to guess the right size.
3	Amp works good, wire is pretty decent quality over all it's a good product, only bad thing is it took a long time to ship
3	The product is fine, we've been using it for years. What chafed me is the way it was packed to ship. The box arrived with the tub on its side inside, loosely padded with large blister packs. The cap was unscrewed from the tub and the foil seal was torn, causing some of the powder to spill into the inside of the box. Messy, but not a total loss. Still, the least effective packing job yet by Amazon.
3	I like the design, color, and size options. They didn't slip, but the whole time I wore them I kept thinking they were drooping. They are worth a shot, but I don't think I would buy again.
3	While the lemon scent was very nice, the packaging says up to 60 days. I used in a non-smoking car and it has had it after 20 days.
3	I like the headphones as a whole but after 60 days the connection to the jack became iffy and sound is now dropping in one ear. If they fix this will change my review.
3	I bought this for 1 gal kombucha batches and to be honest it’s just not necessary. The gallon must sit higher than the bottles so doing everything on the counter will not allow the siphon to flow. So I used it as a pump which was ok... Ultimately this broke while cleaning, after the second use. A tiny part came off the tip and now it won’t even function as a pump. The ratings is based on it inability to fully clean/it breaking after second use
3	This game's simplicity is both it's greatest asset, and biggest weakness. I love how you can teach anyone this game in two minutes, and have a good time. It is also a quick game, and the turns end quickly. On the other hand, this game feels very restrictive. You either constantly run out of cards, or it becomes boring if you hoard them for too long. It's missing a "special sauce." The game could likely be salvaged with another element of strategy--perhaps another card type.
3	So I usually wear a 12/14 in pants. I recently found out I'm expecting, so I went with the 2xl, thinking they would be big and roomy. Well, I'm glad I got the 2xl because they are tight! Not at all the fit I was hoping for to get me through the hot Georgia summer. The quality is ok, nothing special. In my opinion, they are over priced for the product you receive.
3	It was tight fitting but manageable for someone with medium to slender arms. It completed my Supergirl costume and I received many compliments. The colors are exactly how they're pictured with the logo and all.
3	Sometimes repetitive and a bit too earnest. Really wanted it to end earlier. Enjoyed learning about ancient sites in the U.S. and potential reasons for their placement.
3	Velcro seems to be loosing its grip already.
3	This product is difficult to open, spilled a little on myself trying to pry the can open while at the gas pump. you will need a long funnel to be able to pour it in your tank. Came expired so possibly an old product. Do yourself a favor and buy plastic long neck bottle version of this.
3	Great set. One of the parts came off of a bowl. I contacted the seller and they said for me to glue it back on. I did not glue it back on. There are probably enough items to keep the little one happy.
3	I love the design, the quality of the piece is not as good as portrayed.
3	nice fan but the remote does not work, was refunded for the remote but I will have to disassemble the fan to install another remote unit.
3	looks cheap. feels ok. my guess is it will not last long
3	Lucy and her mother, Wanda moved from Tupelo to New Orleans for a new start. Wanda got a job as a hairdresser (Lucy helped out in the salon) that came with an apartment above the salon... This was a short, fast, "okay" read. There was nothing here that makes me want to continue with the series. I was not that interested in the storyline or the characters. Just not my style, I guess...

3	The retaining nuts that loosen/tighten the braces fell out and I can't find where to contact them for any warranty support. Google can't even find them so where is their support folks? Warranty? Anyone? The lock nuts should be "captive" in the bracket and not able to just fall out on the road.
3	Wore these with new pair of shoes that tore up my heels the week before. As a life hack, I have found that KT tape in its original form worked wonders for this purpose in the past, far better than any other blister prevention or bandaid. However, I cannot say the same for the current blister tape Im wearing. After half a day, it has worn completely through, exposing the skin underneath - whereas, any KT tape wearer can attest, true KT tape is so difficult to remove, it often comes with the first layer of skin when you take it off. In other words, save your money and just buy strips of actual KT tape- works way better than this product.
3	Not of Swarovski quality
3	If using an otter box, trim the edges to fit or they'll lift up. Works okay.
3	Shoe is okay but am not too comfortable with the fit on my feet.its abit too formal for me.
3	Nice sizeable rug, very soft maybe a little thin making it cheap looking
3	The material is not soft
3	Doesn't stick as well as I'd like. But good little case.
3	The lights are beautiful, however, 4 are defective and I am returning the item for a replacement. My hope is that when I receive the replacement all will be operational.
3	You can not adjust the osd... Its not Beta flight Configurable. So you always see band voltage etc. Its power hungry so be careful turning it to 500 MW it gets really hot..
3	This is just ok. The levels are pretty close together so it’s hard for my son to really use them if it’s fully stacked. The levels are easily toppled as the stacking bricks don’t really hold together all that well.
3	Pops loose on occasion (has fallen from dash and magnet and pops open
3	These are kinda like the cheapo ones you get at the eye doctor, the wells are deep and it’s slightly difficult to get your contacts out.
3	Was really good to use, especially it being waterproof but at the 6 month mark it started to glitch where it wouldn’t turn on and I had to reset it constantly
3	Good for eyeshadow but made my eyes burn while taking it off and for glitter it didn’t hold up well
3	Good for kids to play with, not particularly pretty balls or box.
3	We love these, but sadly the paint came off batman’s Head within three hours of opening the package.
3	Havent got my order yet
3	Leather is kinda thin, and even using the last notch, it's not as long as we thought it would be. Color matches guitar well.
3	Book is good, but the hard back book corners we're damaged in shipping, could have been packed better to safe guard my product. However it did arrive on time as stated during ordering.
3	Took a long time to arrive. Medium was a little baggy
3	I do enjoy them but they are some what loose fitting
3	Afraid they will swallow in one bite
3	So stiff that my daughter refuses to use them.
3	Ordered a size 12 but it fit like a size 11. I would recommend going up a size
3	I am a bit disappointed in the sound quality especially if I combine 2 sounds like rain on the window and distant thunderstorm. I am going to rethink this purchase.
3	Smaller than expected.
3	3 stars because the eggs are fine they’re just not the size advertised so I can’t use them the way I intended.
3	Did the job, but very cheap and left blue fuzzies everywhere
3	The battery is great! I now have at least four hours of battery life, as opposed to about 15 minutes before I replaced the old one. However, the tools that were included are simply caca. I had to buy a whole set of security tools just for the three-bladed screws that need to be removed. Very frustrating! Be sure to factor that into the total cost when considering this vendor.
3	One bulb works fine the other never worked from the get go.
3	Previous ratings were low for accuracy and there is still flex after tightening the nuts to fix the position of the dividing points
3	Works well but leaves dusty white on black lingerie, which is the very reason I tried it (trying to find an alternative to powder).
3	Fits well and is just like oem except the oem have metal on them where the nuts go so you can't over tighten them. With these you can simply keep turning the nut until it pulls all the way through.
3	This product came, very clearly, with the package sliced open. It appeared to work properly, but someone obviously opened it and sent it back........so lucky me. I’ll leave it at 3 stars for now, since the product itself appears to work as advertised. Just not happy to get someone else’s reject.
3	Arrived hot cause Amazon said posted that it wasn't out for delivery that day so we went out for a few hours, surprise- it's status went from not arriving that day to delivered. Seller said it's okay that it was hot cause could handle some heat. Don't know if it worked. Haven't seen any signs it did or didn't. Don't think I'll get this next year.
3	Good looking but don’t stay tight
3	Bought for my daughter in Colorado. Didn't like the interface as well as the one I have. Not really as useful. I can't really describe it, but it was just not as nice as the newer ones. It works, but not impressive.
3	Item was slightly smaller than expected. Fine craftsmanship however the overall dimensions were less than what was expected
3	Very cute shoe, and I have a little bit of wide feet and that would of been okay, but they were to tight for my big toes. I had to surgery last December and my toe is wider now from it.
3	I dont like it. It is ok for my hall
3	After using this for the last month, it charges phone at normal rate just fine. However, the product states it will support rapid charging and that does not appear to work. Phone never displays rapid charging and the timeframe it takes to charge phone supports that rapid charging is not working. Has solid construction overall.
3	the top is hollow so you cant store anything on top
3	Doesn’t have much butter flavor and seemed more like oil than a butter from a movie theater!
3	I love the style of this fountain but ... The base/pedestal is so thin I can see daylight (voids in the base casting) through multiple areas of just the base and one of the ball design features around the column was broke/shattered on arrival but ... that is understandable seeing as how this one came out of the mold before the final coat/coats of fiberglass were applied. Hope it's a fluke in production because I want another one just like this one for another area of my property. Here's hoping.
3	Dont last long enough even for my 20 lbs pup
3	Missing 2 in the box....
3	I wish I had read through the questions thoroughly before buying these, as I did not realize there are only 5 in a bag. That’s nearly $5 a bone that only lasts about 2 days in our home. The bone is not odor free either despite it’s claim. We have tried other brands that claim that as well, but these do definitely smell.
3	Too small for my wrists. Not comfortable. Good quality though.
3	Looks like it could be a beautiful mirror but it came damaged. The packaging was not damaged at all.
3	I’ve had these for just under 3 months. I loved them at first, and I still appreciate the comfort and convenience they bring to my day. However, they quickly become gross. My nipple hairs, lint, and skin stick to the adhesive. They now have a slight odor after wearing them during sweaty summer days. You can rinse then off with soap and water gently, but you can’t really rub them because the adhesive begins to peel away. These are pretty great for short term use, but over the long term there must be a more durable and affordable solution.
3	Shipping label was placed on the box itself. This made it look really tacky since this is a gift. Item itself is nice.
3	Short story collection from various authors. Needed a bit more editing. A nice book with some quick reads for the busy holiday season.
3	It's cool looking, and super fun but it's a toy, get yourself a serious pair of goggles these are a novelty.
3	Do not know it is a gift for my grandson.
3	Not a great connection when pumping tre up.Struggle to get firm fitting.
3	This is fun for family's and children but not as good as I would have hoped when I downloaded it.
3	It's a well made seat cover, but its way too big for my car. I own an Infiniti G37.
3	My shade missing few magnets on few sections. The magnet is strong enough to hold in place, even when it's a windy day; although, the shade did not prevent ice built-up on windshield last winter in freezing condition. Its material did absorbed some moisture, which caused it to freeze as well. It is quickly to install, remove, and store it away.
3	If your headlights have almost any curvature to them I would recommend not wasting your time or money on this product because it gets a bunch of crinkles in it that are virtually impossible to get out of it is however exactly as described and works exactly as described
3	The bracelet is very cute and I do like it very much. However I was very disappointed that it did not come with a box. I bought it this for a gift and I don’t have a box for it. I’ve bought Alex and Ani before and I know it should have a box. I guess it costs less and is easier to mail without it?
3	I was a happy MetroPCS customer for years, but we moved to an area where the signal sucks so I switched to AT&T. Needed new phones (Ours were quite old) so I looked for an affordable alternative. These looked like a good deal, so I went for it. A few things to keep in mind... 1) One of my phones was new. The other had a SIM card in it, all of the protective plastic removed, and was obviously used. No damage, but I paid for an advertised "Brand New Phone" and am not happy that this one is used. 2) All of the embedded MetroPCS apps are there, but if you are not on Metro none of them work. I have disabled all of the apps I could, but you can't shut them all down, and you may want to use some. I don't have find my phone, for example, and there is no "voice mail" icon to indicate when you have a voicemail and your only access to voicemail is to dial the "1" on the key pad. 3) The playback volume for media is not very loud- my wife uses hers to watch videos off her facebook feed, and you can barely hear them even with the volume all the way up. Overall, I like the phone. Had I known it would be used and would lack some of the features I wanted because although it is unlocked it is still a Metro phone, I would have made a different decision. You might decide differently, but at least you know more than "ITs a great phone and works with AT&T" which is all the information I had to work with.
3	just received it....havent used it yet....love the size and the various ways to us...
3	nice writing but characters are some of the dumbest people alive ie: unbelievable, not plausible, outcome predictable.
3	There were errors in the writing. Some of the dialogue was confusing, the way the characters spoke to each other ( maybe that was intentional) but it did I not add anything to the story. I have read books by this author before, this one was a little confusing all around. They story overall was ok. There have been better.
3	This is my second one the 1st one zipper broke so I decided to try again. Hope this one lasts longer.
3	Doesn’t work as well as I’d like. Falls over.
3	Not sure if these were right for my vehicle they look right and plug in but not as bright as factory yellow cheap bulbs.
3	It would have been beautiful and useful except it was broken when it arrived. It came in an envelope. It should have come in a box so that it would have been more protected.
3	It,s OK. Cheap but I didn,t expect much. I do like the adjustable function. If the charger cord was any shorter it would be non existent. Easy to take out and about.
3	Is there any way to trouble shoot?
3	They work well enough to use if you're just sitting in a room. Battery's not great and the connection with my phone is terrible when I put my phone in basketball short pockets. Yes, I tested this out. I already have headphones that I use when I'm lounging around so these may get returned. The price is good, they stay in your ears, the sound is good... but the fact that I can't hardly use these if I'm out and about makes me feel like I wasted money.
3	Got it for daughter. She wanted the black leather storm trooper one so this mine now. Thick, stiff but sturdy. Gotten several compliments.
3	My daughter absolutely loved them, on bummer was that one broke when she went to wear it the first time.
3	Think this book had potential to be really good if there had been further development of the characters and story line.
3	Didnt really seem to work much.
3	Missing some time of the little wood dowel pieces that hide the screws. I have purchased two of these before and not had that problem. Otherwise a very nice luggage rack.
3	I should have paid attention to the product description. I wanted a typing trainer software package to load onto my kids' PC, which I do not leave connected to the internet to avoid the necessity of constant monitoring. The description clearly states that the product being sold is an access key to an on-line class. Given our situation, the on-line nature of the course seriously limits its utility. Serves me right for not reading the product description. On the other hand, the classes themselves look decent. Training and repetition are limited compared to some of the old programs I used back in the 90's. The videos are ok, and the games are a lot prettier than what I grew up with, which I guess is good for engaging the kids.
3	Feel pretty good but condom broke.
3	These pants are very nice,good fit and length. The material is good quality.They washed well and no ironing. All this is fine. However, why don't you do something about that dreadful non-snapping snap?? Several reviewers have mentioned that the snap is terrible, especially on such nice pants. We snapped the snap shut (not easy) and my husband simply uses the elastic waist to pull the pants up and down. Very inconvenient, but works! Fix that snap and I'll but another pair for my husband.
3	Easy in, did the job.
3	the cheese cake pan was too small to hold recipe for instant pot so it ran over. Will try to find a different recipe and try it again. I would also prefer fewer but larger bowls that fit in pot. The quality of pans very good 11
3	This shirt fit fine & was ok quality, but the color of the sleeves was not at all what I expected. It was more orange & burgundy than black & red. I returned it.
3	Disappointed that no power cord is included. They recommend using a power cord for things like keyboards (which is one of the main uses for items like this), but don't include one. I already had one from Ultra that I had misplaced the power cord.
3	I didn't like the fact the gal container was opened when receiving it and shipping was apparently hard on it as it had spilled and a lot it was inside the box it was shipped in.
3	Fits well, but doesn’t warm up enough.
3	Over all the Parkland Pet Foldable Playpen is good and the size is large enough to let our cat have enough room to have her litter box and bed and toys in when we went to visit our son when we helped him move. HOWEVER, the bottom would be better if it, too was made from the canvas material the rest of it is made from. We clip our cats nails, but the bottom got holes in it and we had to use gorilla tape underneath to prevent it from getting worse. Also, at one point her water dish tipped and it got wet underneath on the carpet, so it's not waterproof. You get 3 stars because it does do the job, but it could be better.
3	We ordered this game for outside time camping. Got good reviews but we were not completely satisfied with it as our blocks were not totally smooth...which affects the game and some chipped upon first use of the game and we also have a cracked piece.
3	It is good to have USB charge connection. It is too big for travel.
3	Planted them none of them came up
3	The quality is good, I’ve had them for a few months in a humid environment and in the bath twice and they didn’t rust or look like they will rust. It’s not very easy to get the tool around both sides of the ingrown toenail, and it didn’t work like the YouTube videos I’ve seen. As I was screwing it tighter to straighten the nail, my nail just broke off, now it did brake off the ingrown part, so I did get some relief at the moment, but it was really short and of corse not straight so it grew back ingrown again. I would not say it fixed my ingrown problem.
3	Very small print. Hard to read
3	Suprisingly very nice to work with. They are not as deeply pigmented as more expensive pencils, but I find they have nice pastel like shades that will come in useful on occasion. Also they are a bit harder than most pencils so will keep a point longer, and will be handy for tiny spaces. I use pencils for adult coloring books.
3	For light-duty it is a very good flashlight. Nice and bright and can use basic batteries. Unfortunately I bought them for work. I've dropped two of them and both of them quit as soon as they hit the ground. So definitely not as durable as I need. If you're just using them around the house or in the car very good light. If your hard on lights then I would definitely avoid these. Get the small single AA tactical lights that can use the 14500 rechargeable lithium batteries. With the lithium batteries they are extremely bright and extremely durable. I've had two for almost 3 years and drop them constantly. Even dropped one nearly 12 feet onto concrete. Never had a problem with them.
3	I have to say that I like the quality of this cover. But it has blown off my car three times during storms. Each time I resecure it. I live in Florida and we have had some strong storms but I think they need more straps to keep it on car.
3	This product was as described. The only reason I returned is it seems to be cheaply made by Vera Bradley. The seller was great to work with.
3	This is my mother's favorite coffee. We normally have no problems with it. It arrived busted today and is not eligible for return. The coffee is great, the shipping was less than...
3	I love the light. It is 3 way which is perfect by my bed. putting the backplate on the wall was easy enough, only problem was the white knob(s) that are supposed to cover the screws that hold the backplate to the wall and then come thru the white lamp face plate were missing.......no....one was missing but the one that was there did not fit properly. these are not just decorative but essential to hold the plate to the wall........ inside the box was the email address and phone number I plan on calling tomorrow and asking for two more white screw covers...other than that it was easy install and works great!
3	Good flavor, good product...just a really small jar. The normal size jar I usually see this brand of bouillon in is on the right of the picture. A bit expensive for the price. The only reason I would buy again is I can't find this brand for sale anywhere else right now.
3	I have very dry, and sometimes cracked, heels. This works ok, not great. I have had other creams that worked better (prescription cream containing urea worked the best).)
3	This product did help to clear out my skin a little, but not as much as I expected. Not disappointed because I know my skin doesn't usually take to just any product. I do like using the soap on my body because it makes me feel a lot cleaner for a lot longer than traditional soaps.
3	This thing is not as large as I had imagined when I purchased it. That said, it would probably be a decent bag for travel if you only have a few items of clothing that you need to carry. I would probably not purchase another. I gave it three stars because the construction seems to be solid enough, it's just too small to be of much use to me as an actual laundry bag. YMMV.
3	This produce is good for light light sanding but nothing more.
3	Didn't care for the flavor. Seemed garlicky
3	the chain was cheap but the locket and charms were good
3	It was a nice, slow rising squishy but the top broke off not long after playing with it for a while. It smelled nice.
3	Shorter than expected. Kind of difficult to put on and lace up. The jewels were coming off, upside down and neither of the gloves looked like the other. I will need to spend some time fixing and sprucing these up.
3	it does not stay on tile
3	Cute costume. The pants were too long for our 17 month old but I was able to cut the excess off and you couldn’t tell. Overall was a good purchase for the price.
3	Thinner than I thought it would be. Not bad if you have something to go with it.
3	I love Clark shoes but....I had to return these because they hurt my feet by my big toe.
3	Item was very bulky around the arms and thin around the waste. Cuffs were just hot glued on and sewed: you could see the glue.
3	Very soft and fit according to size chart provided, but... I would not wear these to run or workout in at all. No compression at all which helps for blood return and muscle support, not to mention smoothing out the lumps and bumps. These would be great for lounging around in or as pjs. Oh, the other thing I'm not thrilled about is that the color (I got the royal blue) is no where near as bright or vibrant as pictured, in fact they aren't even royal blue. They're more of a regular blue with a slightly lilac hue. So there's that. 😩 But like I said, if you're looking for lounging leggings, these fit the bill. But for actual exercise... not so much. Next!
3	I bought this for my daughters 2nd birthday outfit, the stripes are blue when I figured they would be black and the two pinks (bow and tutu) do not match, the bow is much brighter than the tutu. Hopefully it will still look good.
3	I purchased these locks because they were described as having 7mm shanks. I needed that size to fit a hitch ball lock opening. However, upon arrival, they did not fit as the shanks were 8mm. Returned immediately, thank you Amazon! The seller's description was inaccurate, not sure why.
3	Sound is pretty good, stylish looking speaker but the length given on the cords is rediculously short! I am going to have to by extenders just so it doesn’t look like my speakers are trying to strangle my monitor
3	The stands strip easily since they are a cheap product. I use the green screen frequently but the stands for the lights don't lock in place very well.
3	These were used as coasters for a centerpiece for an event, but they were not very sturdy. The appearance also looked slightly cheap, and some seemed significantly smaller than the others.
3	The product was fine just not the right size. They were way too small for what I needed. I will try and find a different craft to use them.
3	Loved that it was packed in a cooler but ice bag that was included to keep it cool was ruptured and leaked all over candy and external box. After drying off and inspecting the chocolate it was in a sealed bag and by appearance should be ok Maybe the ice bag should be put in a sealed bag also?
3	Battery does not last and should for this price. Shaves delicate sweater nicely but goes slow. No indicator saying when battery is dead or charged. Light indicating when it’s plugged in is functional but useless because it’s obvious when it is plugged in!
3	These were a big let down, not because they were not as advertised, but because the Marks and Spencer brand of these biscuits (cookies) are so much inferior to Crawford's custard creams, which you can pick up at your friendly neighborhood Publix in the international-foods area. I bought these to compare and had them shipped from the UK, but on the first bite it was immediately apparent that these lose the contest. The wafers have almost no flavor, and the cream in the middle is on the dry side and also less flavorful than it ought to be. Golden Oreos beat these hands down. If you're looking for proper British custard creams, get the Crawford brand.
3	Very cute and very tiny.
3	okay story, but not really grabbing me. Read it and another book at the same time and I have never done that before.
3	Broke after a couple uses.
3	Great sleeping bag compact and light but can’t get it back in the bag . Three people tried to get it in the bag and none of us could ended up ripping the bag .
3	The reason for the 3 stars is the color. The product seemed to be good quality I just didn't like the pastel colors. I wanted to use them for Christmas but they are more suited for Easter/ Spring decorating which I don't normally do. Will probably send them back even though I have to pay 5.99 for return shipping. I would still recommend them for folks who want pastel lights
3	This might be suited well for four year olds. The words were a little hard to read due to font/page colors.
3	Product received not the brand advertised. I specifically ordered this brand as it is the one that came with the lamp. There is no place to leave seller feedback.
3	didn't fit on my cabinet door but I still use it
3	They look great (as the pictures show). But when they arrived, I thought "wow, those are tiny." Not too small to use. They function. They might be for you. But read the small print on size.
3	I didn’t get the cover for the grill. I asked for a replacement, they tried to charge me for it. I just told them just forget it. Haven’t tried the grill out, I’ll let you know what happened.
3	Bronson did it better!
3	It’s just ok. It takes some effort to get the unusual shape inserted, and requires some maneuvering to get the right angle. Even then, just ok. I like the basic plastic, non-vibrating option better I think.
3	I really like the case - looks very sleek but the gold trim started chipping a little and I only had it for less than a week which is disappointing but all in all still a good product.
3	I thought this was going to have a built In mic?
3	Not strong enough for heavy drafts But minor works pretty good
3	I paid for the shipping my self. I should have received a full refund. Please adjust. I can’t find any other way to contact you.
3	This is very cute and the one size fit me fine. It’s a little itchy where the embroidery is but the main issue is that it shrunk considerably when I washed it . I didn’t even put it in the dryer and it’s way too short now so I’m using it as a beach/ pool cover up which is fine I guess.. could also be a top with jeans or leggings. That’s how much it shrunk up ..
3	It works right out of the box...just plug it in and turn it on. HOWEVER, I got this for a very humid basement and it just does not take the moisture out of the air efficiently. I've had it running nonstop for over 2 weeks now and can only get the humidity down to 56%. I recommend finding and spending more on a better one.
3	Some are brown and not fresh. Very hard, just like 1st cut.
3	Not normally a hard-core sci-fi reader, but the book description and reviews caught my attention. Initially, I had doubts about the non-human narrative, but that actually became more interesting over the course of the next 200 pages. The idea of the story covering millennia was also cool...until it wasn’t. The story begins to lag badly about 60% in, and the human characters seem to be living variations of the same scenario without really adapting or learning from their previous mistakes. Maybe there’s a point there, but it eventually got tiresome. If edited down by a third, I think I could have enjoyed this more, but by the last part, I just wanted it to end, with no feelings of investment for how that happened.
3	I have pain in my feet at the end of the day .Pain flows up my leg.
3	I bought this to trim the bushes I have in my backyard (there are 3 on either side of my porch, so 6 total). As I pulled it out of the box, one of the cushioning pieces fell off. While it was simple to just stick it back on, it falls off frequently. Not too big of a deal, but certainly annoying to have to constantly be aware of it and actively try not to lose it (it’s tiny). The bigger issue is that the blades aren’t nearly as sharp as they should be. Like I said, I only have 6 small bushes, so it’s not like I’m trying to saw off tree limbs — this should easily handle a job like mine, but sometimes it takes a lot more effort than it should to cut through. I’d recommend these only for your smallest trimming work.
3	Well... I’ve been looking for an indoor/outdoor weather station and although there are a lot of options out there, I couldn’t find the one I was looking for necessarily. So I tried this one. It doesn’t look bad and temperature seems to be relatively close to accuracy. The “only” drawback is that if you stare at it anything further than 45 degrees from the center, the screen starts to look distorted, meaning, you can barely see the numbers. When you’re looking straight to it, then it looks great. I played a little with the brightness of screen and it didn’t do any good. I think it will depend on where you set it on but just bare in mind that if your angle or view is wider than 45 degrees, this may not be as useful as it is designed to be.
3	Right hand was painful to wear as the pinky & ring finger was wrapped so tight It felt like a tourniquet was on them. I ordered the large thinking I would have extra room? left hand was tight but tolerable. I hope the leather stretches ? Otherwise I may return them?
3	Socks are of decent quality but are rather short. One pair is almost white with a very light gray pattern. Very unattractive. Nothing like the pair in the photo. I will never wear that pair of socks so I donated them to charity.
3	Unit appears to be working properly. NOTE: Product has conflicting instructions concerning wiring for automatic vs manual function. The box says brown wire is for auto function. WRONG! The written instructions inside the box say the brown-white wire is for auto. CORRECT. You better test yours before finishing your wiring.
3	Trying to get the soft nosed Nerf darts like came with the gun, but these were harder nosed. These work good, but are not as good for small boys.
3	Haven't used as yet.
3	Good idea, but limited on what can be stored. If they included a case for utensils, a pocket or two, and also a handle, then it would be much more useful.
3	Definitely does not have a 150 miles range. Maybe 50 miles at best.
3	The product is ok ... You get what you pay for. Nothing more nothing less.
3	Let me start off by saying that this thing is super small . I saw a video of it that made it look bigger than it is . That’s the first thing you wanna know is is it too small for you . It seems about half the size of a normal RC car . I won’t comment too much further on it because I don’t know how it runs yet I’m still charging the batteries but it’s way too small . I will be buying a bigger one ☝️
3	The book was not what I thought it would be.
3	I can not tell how much brighter they are over the standard OEM bulbs that I replaced, but I think they improved line-of-sight vision a little.
3	Bought the light blue pair and loved them, however the black pair was a completely different material and not stretchy at all like the others. I was very let down
3	It's super cute and not hard to install but the wood are a little cheap... one of them is broken ☹
3	Not durable as expected. Flimsy, stands coming off after a short period and unable to fix due to design flaws. Daughter Still using it though, without one stand.
3	Still trying to figure out how to make it work!!! Watching the video, have tried 2x and didn't work.....
3	My bottles leak. I've tried multiple sprayers and switched them from different bottles and they all leak standing upright. Not buying again. My product is being wasted.
3	I love spicy but this was a little too much
3	I expected this to have some cushioning and it doesn't. The ground is just as hard without the rug. I will say I like the color and the rug looks nice in my bathroom. No padding at all though, so I was disappointed but kept it.
3	Larger than expected
3	So far I've made 4 or 5 recipes from this cookbook and have to say that about half turned out to be good and the other half not so much. One was a complete disaster and waste of ingredients and I made sure to follow the recipe exactly. So overall I'm a bit disappointed in the quality of the recipes in this book.
3	Wish that the backlight stayed on permanently it makes it difficult to see the time without touching it every 10 seconds. Also this takes some time to get used to how to set it despite instructions provided
3	Used it for a month or so. The problem is pairing is not perfect and sometimes doesn’t happen. It’s annoying when you can’t pair your phone or that one side pairs and the other side doesn’t. Lame.
3	The finished product looks nice BUT you definitely need a hammer or thick book for the small disks because they do not fit on their own. Secondly, it’s much shorter than I initially thought it would be. Lastly, mine arrived with several splits in the particle board (one example pictured)
3	I found the format difficult to use but I can see that if you can answer the questions without the standard multiple choice answers, this is a good resource and a good way to test your knowledge.
3	Sometimes it’s 11pm and you just want to get in the car, go to Safeway and get your ice cream. It’s hard to do that when the car cover is a part of the picture. I found myself not driving my car for over a week because I didn’t want to remove the thing and potentially deal with a spider crawling out from Under it.. and onto me... and then having to put it back on. Who has time and energy for that? Nevertheless, it does the job. I don’t use the little lock strap that comes with it, but it kept my car clean and didn’t scratch it. It’s also too big for the bag it comes in, so I have to keep it in a ball in the back of my car which I do not enjoy. This is mainly a personal preference thing.
3	Cannot use right out of the box on the back of Winnebago motorhome. The receiver is tucked under the rear of the coach and in order to use this carrier the pedals and handlebars need to be removed. I gave 3 stars because while the rack is well designed and well made, nowhere does it say it won't extend far enough. I read a lot of reviews here before I bought it, and came back and read more trying to figure out what my next move would be. One reviewer mentioned an extension, and I found one here at Amazon designed just for this purpose -- to use a bike rack. It's annoying a product made for an RV doesn't not state it is designed to work on only a trailer or class C camper. Another issue is we will not be able to use either our furnace or generator while it's inserted in the receiver. In my photo you can see the receiver under the body of the coach. The two vents in the center are for the gas furnace and the tiny pipe in the lower left of the picture is the generator exhaust pipe. While the furnace is not an issue, in California's 100°+ Central Valley, we frequently run our generator while traveling to power our air conditioning. I'm not certain it's possible with bikes a mere inches from the exhaust.
3	You get what you pay for. It feels a little bit cheap but for the price it gets the job done.
3	Love these curtain. Exactly what I needed.
3	Not well constructed.
3	As noted before by a few - this is fairly short. I think I should have gotten a medium not a small as I did. The sleeves are long - which is fine - but I actually hate the thumb holes in this I didn’t know they would be there, I usually love thumb holes.
3	This book is a good read. Interesting characters. Enjoyed the twist and turns that it gave the reader.
3	My order came with a mix of mascara types. I ordered waterproof and received it plus non waterproof which smudges when wet.
3	It ok, not sure its for me. i was excited to try this. when i wore it to bed i felt smelling in the morning. i had to switch back.
3	I didn't really like the flavors...but they provide protein
3	The title of the book is all about learning Python. But what it failed to highlight was, it is actually a book for the intermediate to advance users. The book is not structured for the beginner and often enough, if you are a beginner you will find your self lost in a maze of analogies and technical jargon. For example, the author tries to convey the best technique for sound programming in Python, but He goes off on a tangent and provided you with some other details of how not to program in Python. If you are a beginner, you will become lost, and won't be able to track back on some of these examples. At the end of the chapter, you will have to read it again in order to grasp a clearer understanding of how Python works. But then again, Python is all about simplicity, this book is not simple at all. The coding examples provided also does not provide you with enough details on real life and practical usage of how it is applied in the real world, and does not quite teach the beginner about its inner workings.
3	This is a great Idea, they are just a bit to small and I don’t have a big foot.
3	I got the wrong product. Instead of DHT Blocker, I received Shou Wu Hair formula. So I cannot give a proper review.
3	Bought 2, one of the on buttons fell down into the unit, but I bought another because it's amazing otherwise and I'll just try to be more gentle
3	I bought these poultry shears with the plan to spatchcock (butterfly) my 18 lb turkey for Thanksgiving. Things didn't go as planned - the shears were unable to cut through the large turkey bones of the turkey. They easily cut through smaller bones/cartilage and I'm sure I'll find plenty of uses for them around the kitchen, however they did not work for the purpose I bought them for.
3	Could not repair the wound on my heart that my ex girlfriend Sally Sue Janie made when she left me for Roger Lee Stevens.
3	The length was right
3	Ordered this case but two whole packs (4 individual) were rotten. I could even smell it right through the cover. At first I thought there must be a puncture of some kind but could not find any. So knock off 2 or more and that is how many one gets for the price.
3	This had a positive effect on my 2 year old when she took it, regulating her mood a bit. However, it also made her gag, and the other day she threw it up, so we'll have to find an alternative.
3	They had a great variety of stickers and all in great detail but, they do not stick for longer than a month without rolling up.
3	Thought it would be brighter! But when it is in the bathroom it is sort of ok... Bought it for Christmas gifts (9) and was going to return till I took it to the bathroom it was ok. If anything more than 7x I would have returned.
3	So slippery. Great color. I love them. Daughter did not
3	I've never done any scrapbooking before, but I wanted to make one for a trip I went on recently. I thought this kit would be perfect. It had a few items to start me off without spending a ton of money on it. I was really excited about it, but unfortunately my kit was missing the stickers, stamps and stencils it said it came with. I do love the book and the case itself though. I like that I am able to customize the cover of the book and also the box that came with it. I just wish I had all the cute scrapbooking supplies that I thought would be with it.
3	Extremely firm to sit on. It’s not a plush sofa at all. Easy to put together
3	I bought this shaker as a gift for my boyfriend upon his request. He tried it out the day I gave it to him with much excitement but when he shook it the lid leaked a lot. He still loves it and is trying to use it but still uses mostly his other shakers as they don’t get his drinks all over when he shakes. I wish this had worked better but I’m afraid it will eventually end up in the back of the cabinet never to be seen again.
3	The head is small and has a lot of breakage prior to using it. Has a nice consistency if hair though. Arrived quickly!
3	Appearance. Not packaged well honey all over the outside of the package. Product fell out of the cardboard when I picked it up. Seems awfully thin for honey.
3	I like the idea and it really does help but it is really rough and painful on my delicate underarm area. Also, water gets stuck inside the brush every time I use it in the shower and doesn’t come out on its own so that’s a little inconvenient for me.
3	Doesn't hold my phone so made my workout a lol troublesome
3	My dog loves the food, but the shipping has a lot to be desired. It came in an envelope instead of a box, which caused the product to be smashed during shipping. I receive lots of boxes from Amazon, this should be a product shipped in a box. Shame on you Amazon.
3	Wish the felt it's were a bit thicker and the adhesive would stay stuck :-/
3	I use the silver one primarily and it works! But the magnet on it seems to be getting weaker. So I decided to switch to the black one. Unfortunately the black one won't connect properly to the watch, it just falls off. I wish the silver one had lasted longer, because I really do prefer these over a normal stiff watch band
3	Makes your hands sweat
3	I can't stand to smell it. It smells like my hemp oil, which makes me want to throw up. I'm giving it away. I'm sure it's a good Essential Oil, but it's not smell I can tolerate. I was looking for a forest/pine scent
3	Vendor is working really hard to correct issue with thin hair. Will update once vendor corrects issue. Great customer service.
3	Ok, but the lids are obnoxious.
3	Assembly was not clear. I had to assemble, test and reassemble till I got it right.
3	It does exactly what it's supposed to do, just not a any impressive speed.
3	Good product, but only holds keyboard and not a mouse, unlike the last time I ordered this product a few years back.
3	I was initially attracted to the chute cord on the handle. After getting it, took it out camping and realized that a good hatchet needs weight to it. This hatchet has no weight to it. I could see it being used for small tasks but not hacking a branch that is 2 inches or thicker.
3	A little smaller than I thought it would be, but a decent case for lots of small items. The pockets with zippers are a little small though.
3	Too fragranced for me...gave me a headache.
3	The watch and step tracker work great. The blue tooth pairing with my phone is spotty but it usually notifies me of incoming texts and lets me pause or play music. My two main complaints are (1) the hear rate monitor is ALWAYS wrong and not just by a little bit (I can be exercising full out at the gym with my heart rate monitor reading 160 bpm and the watch will tell me I'm at 72) and (2) it's easy to accidentally hit the watch face throughout the day, so I've ended up with days where the watch thinks I went on a long bike ride or I've accidentally hanged the time just because I accidentally hit the face while going about my day.
3	Runs VERY small, rips easy.
3	This product is too big for a newborn baby.
3	Very comfy, fit as expected, nice size pockets and draw string. Overall ok quality after a few washes the hem on the inside leg started to fray about the same quality you would expect from walmart if you are comparing.
3	I watched it but I should have found a better was my time.
3	Product package was opened and tapped back together when I received it. Ball was coated in some kind of oil type product. The ball dispenses the treats really quickly so it's not very entertaining for long. Using larger (than kibble) treats may help.
3	Tastes a little greasy, not as smooth as the European Truffles, The price is much cheaper than the good ones though.
3	For some reason i have to make my computer reboot several times during the week to reconnect it.
3	The magnets fell off the eyelashes within minutes of application- I am going to use eye glue to still wear them but disappointed
3	My book arrived with the cover ripped!
3	The lights work but - no surprise - are pretty flimsy. Good luck getting the tripods in and out of the handles.
3	Ok movie, but at a great price.
3	I did not purchase this pillow for sleep. It is too firm for my use as a pillow as I have extremely sensitive ears to pressure as well as a neck issue. I bought this pillow for my recliner to use as a cushion. So far, I am pleased. The washable cover is nice and is soft. Delivery was timely as well.
3	Love all the features and fit my iPad 2017 perfectly... it just would not stay charged. Perhaps this one was just a lemon
3	Guess I didn't realize these were all black and white. Wish they were colored.
3	Stopped by TSA too large did not pass security in Florida
3	The package arrived with everything but the power cable that plugs into the wall and the black transformer box. Was told they couldn't just send that one piece, that I would have to return and reorder the entire thing. Luckily we had an old power cable laying around that we were able to use.
3	I thought it would fit a lot looser and flow more, but it's pretty tight. The color is pretty, and I like the design of the dress.
3	I love the story but I can’t stand the formatting. The publishers of this edition took no care in setting the line length and making sure it matched the page size.
3	I would give this movie a 3.5 stars instead of a 3 if it were possible. We liked the movie, however, it moved way too fast and the characters were not as well developed as in other versions of this same film. So, if you just want a quick version of this movie, this one will work well. If you want more development, I would recommend the Sony Pictures Classics version of this movie.
3	Box says max pump of 2 HP. I didn’t see this in the description so I get to send it back.
3	I like them but I usually wear a 81/2 or 9 and the 8 was large. Because they didn't fit right they slide off a lot.
3	Rug is nice, (but from the pictures I expected it to be a bit thicker, than what it actually is). It is a good quality rug for the price. My dogs love to lay on it It is very pretty and a lighter color than I expected from the pictures of it. I am pleased with the product and would definitely recommend it .
3	it seems like the price is cheaper on the exact box of food, for some reason I paid a higher price than the 10 and change, not sure why amazon does this.......also my cats do not seem to like this food, when I get it in the supermarket they eat it.....not sure where this food comes from. the price difference is on the amazon website, it did not allow me to choose the lower price when I was ordering. I will be more careful to order again.
3	Thin like a micro towel, okay, but I like the Terry cloth better
3	They would work if the stay on
3	It could not take very many drops before the light stopped working correctly on all settings. High setting has started to behave like low setting.
3	No very wrinkle resistant. Really needs to be ironed every wash. They look tired after 4 or 5 washes.
3	the confetti just settled at the bottom right off the bat and wasn't cute at all. at least they were of use when they got popped for the improv photo shoot
3	I love how they look however they’re not comfortable at all. I commute to work and the trip with these on is very difficult. I come home in so much pain that it goes up to my legs.
3	The book itself is a great tool in weight loss. I would recommend it.
3	This looks nice and is something I could make myself in 2 hours if I wasn’t feeling lazy. I think the feet should have a bit of rubber to keep it from sliding on smooth surface flooring if you don’t have the perfect angle against the wall.
3	The clock digits are nice & big so they're easy to read. Because they're so big, the dates and temperatures are much smaller. Depending on the lighting, the clock, as a whole, is difficult to read. I'd prefer to have a lighter background so the digits are more legible.
3	When it did work it was PERFECT. The charging port broke within the year and I could never figure out how to fix it.
3	Like other reviewers, I'm disappointed they changed the formula. My dog has a bunch of problems and pees/poo's himself everytime he goes out. I use these in-between baths to keep him clean and they used to be a LIFESAVER. With the new formula he doesn't get nearly as clean as he used to and he still smells. They work and I be see soils coming off, just not completely.
3	They are much smaller than I anticipated. They seem like they may bend with some bigger hanging flower pots. I’ve used it to hold up a humming bird feeder instead
3	Dog loves these toys. Great price. They do get very stringy though after she chews on them, at which point we throw them away.
3	Super cute and comfortable
3	Love toe socks. These are low and stay put.
3	Great price, good quality.
3	The quality of the backpack is terrible. Broke within first month of purchase. The refunded my money no problem.
3	I have a 75 lbs lab and this bowl says it holds 2 cups. There is no way I could fit 2 cups of dry food in this bowl. It would be great for smaller dogs but I needed to return it and find something else to slow his eating.
3	I want to give this case 5 stars but it leaves a moisture/watery/oily look on the back of the phone where the glass touches the plastic. I was expecting a nice clear view of my phone without having these watery looking sections on the back... On most of the videos and images I've seen, I didn't think this was going to be an issue but it is. I have wiped everything down over and over and put the phone in the case without even touching and still there is this moisture or w/e look... :(
3	good skin smells great
3	I find this game pretty entertaining but sometimes you run out of things to do, and it is no longer fun.
3	While this is great for babies to hold and feed themselves pureed fruits and veggies it is so incredibly difficult to thoroughly clean that it's almost not worth using. I wouldn't recommend this product.
3	Was a great gift my friend loved it but one necklace the stone broke in half the other the stone cane out but other then that it was good
3	Very cute design but fabric was rougher than expected, especially for a kid’s use. Have washed a few times but still no softening. Hoping that will change.
3	While they are very comfortable, the Bluetooth connection isn't consistent and the sounds constantly goes in and out. I would not recommend.
3	Not nearly as good as the previews made it look. But not bad either.
3	Very uncomfortable, if sharing with someone you can feel every time they move.
3	Really cool features - eg the scanner can actually scan each item with a neat little code built into the items. But there's a kind of obnoxious voice that speaks every time (every. time.) you press a button, and like the other reviews say, it's a thick asian accent and some of the phrases sound like they're from Google Translate (ie wrong). Another thing is they do the ABC song right halfway, then it starts being wrong halfway through! I will say though, the 3 year old loves this so far. Unfortunately, the microphone broke within 15min. So we'll probably be returning this. Not sure if we'll get the same thing back.
3	These boots are cute but don’t expect them to last if your baby is walking. My daughter (22 months) wore them once for about 4 hours and the fabric began to come off near the toe of the shoe. The soles are not durable enough for these shoes to be worn outside so unless you’re buying them for a baby who doesn’t walk, I’d pass.
3	Pros- Quick setting as advertised, strong but still a little flex. Cons- Plunger dispenser is deceptive, does not bond well to other surfaces (non-plastic) I bought this to repair plastic attachment mounts on the body kit on my car that is 17 years old and is lowered. The front attachments that I repaired seem to be holding up well. I used this on my front fender that has a prior body shop repair that failed. they used some steel mesh and and epoxy to re-attach the quarter panel mounting strap to the body. After years of driving I hit a parking bumper that pushed the bumper back and popped the epoxy. I attempted to use the existing metal mesh and this to fix it, However I slightly scrapped going through a dip in the road and the slight pressure caused this epoxy to release as well. Trust me, I used A LOT of this epoxy on that joint! The plunger being deceptive. You HAVE to push down on the DEAD CENTER of the plunger to get it to dispense evenly. If not it will push out more of one side than the other. Be aware of possible air bubbles as well.
3	It did not hold dash cam in place, slots all wrong.
3	Large plates don't fit in a standard microwave, and paint missing in areas (product was rushed in production)
3	These covers are made of very nice material, but it isn't ideal for the purpose of the pillow. The material is a very soft, fussy type of fabric which makes the pillow very slick and causes it to slide out from under the baby and off my lap while I'm nursing. If I'm not clutching the pillow in place I might as well not even be using it
3	No big deal. Just looks different.
3	Case is pretty cheaply made, I mean it looks nice but I don't expect it to last long. And the screen protector that comes with it is junk. Mine cracked before I even got it on the screen. I had just placed the first edge on my phone & it cracked. I'm glad I had the foresight to order a spare screen protector from OtterBox. The case was a little difficult to get together, but I looked at it like a puzzle & it didn't take too long to figure it out. So bottom line this case wasn't expensive & you get what you pay for. It's cute, & it'll serve my purposes for now. But just make sure you buy a spare screen protector!
3	Not easy to apply because not as smooth as regular chapstick, and has weird odor that's different than the sunscreen of same brand. 3 star because it works for sunscreen on your lips and is reef safe so it's good to put on before snorkeling or diving. It's effective for what it is needed for.
3	The lining of the jacket isn’t as thick as I thought or wanted. Not worth going through the hassle of sending it back.
3	These are really big and ugly in person but they do work. I'm sorry I got them but it's too late to return them.
3	An OK series, I read the first book and had a hard time getting into the next in the series.
3	The cover is beautiful but it had a large cut/tear on it when I opened it to put it on my pool table. I bought it for my husbands bday but was moving t the time so just opened it in March so now I'm stuck with the cut/torn cover.
3	My daughters were so excited to begin their countdown, I purchased this one and another style for my 7 year old and 3 year old. Unfortunately after recieving and opening the first 1, the chocolate had made their way to the bottom of the package and were no longer in their slots, defeating the purpose of opening each day, and hanging to reach down to the bottom to retrieve a chocolate. However the design was so cute and colorful. Maybe update the design with deeper chocolate pockets so they dont fall out at the warehouse or during transit.
3	I don't know what happened but the original string isn't any better than this generic string. This one breaks off and also sticks together so it won't auto feed.
3	I personally didn't see an increase in supply, but I know some other mamas that swear by this. Tastes like hell.
3	Wanted a variety pack Disappointed though that out of 8 pair of socks 4 were black and white striped. Not too much a variety there.
3	The quality is not the best — at all. I recommend you purchase them if you are not going to wear them often. I wear them once a week and that is good enough for me. However, after wearing them once they started to deteriorate. I do not recommend them if you want decent to good quality shoes.
3	The baby carrier isn’t that bad. I use it every week when I go grocery shopping with the kids. My baby has loved it as she is close to me & see everything at my level. She has even fallen asleep in it, although her head limps around & i have to support it. It tends to dig into my shoulder sometimes. It’s not really ergonomic but you get what you pay for.
3	These headphones are very comfortable and work fine for gaming. The sound could be better and I'm not crazy about plugging them into my controller. Overall not a bad headset for the price
3	One of the bottles was already open and made a mess inside the box. Rest of bottles were sealed. Never happened before ordering Bai from Amazon.
3	I just washed my tablecloth for the first time and I used the recommended ultra clean crayola brand. I’m sad to say it didn’t all completely wash out. My kids love the product but wish it had completed washed out like it said.
3	Product fits my daughter's new tablet perfectly and I love the design. I was a little bummed the case came damaged when there was no damage to the outer packaging. My kiddo is 8 so there's no sending it back and waiting for the replacement. Still, I'm happy with the purchase overall
3	I have used this type of epoxy before from an industrial source, and the strength of this project was a disappointment.
3	The packaging was damaged in shipping affecting some of the product My cat loves the food.
3	I use goggles for mowing and since I mow of an evening a clear lens is necessary. This item did not come with that.
3	The frame poles are fragile and the seams on the pockets the poles insert into are fragile. The first time I assembled it, a pocket ripped and was unusable. The shape makes it perfect size and even broken it’s a highly useful tool.
3	One bottle was not enough to make an accurate review as this product was something that would have to be used over a few months to determine just how effective it would be.
3	No lip mask included.
3	Love the look of it but the magnet in the band consistently drains my battery. Normally the battery lasts me the whole day and when I use this band it lasts about half the day.
3	I am 5'7 200lbs and I usually wear a 14 but ordered a 16 based on reviews and also I asked other persons who bought. The 16 is small, an 18 would have been better. I am on a weight loss journey so I guess it will fit better in a few weeks. I ordered 2 colors and they both fit tight.
3	Beautiful but not big like it shows
3	I bought these bc my detergent and fabric softener are on shelves and I’m tired of taking them down to do laundry. I suppose it gets the job done and they must have made adjustments to it bc it snapped perfectly into my gain soap and Kirkland soften dispensers. However, for both, there’s a lot of slash that comes with using this which isn’t a deal breaker but annoying.
3	Filter screen tore on second use! Loved it until that happened!
3	I bought this product for my cat. Unfortunately he does not like the taste so I have a bit more trouble getting him to take this than I did with the Salmon flavor which he loved. Since he is a cat, smell and flavor are important is getting a good response. It has a very strong smell that kind of sticks around after you use it. The product works, just not the flavor. Might be better for a dog..
3	I've read all of John Green's books. This one was a bit of a departure from the casual teenage adventures he wrote before. This book was an internal adventure for a very real mental illness. I'm sorry to say I was somewhat disappointed and eager for the book to end. As a fan of Mr. Green, I'll keep reading his books but this one is not my favorite.
3	So I have never bought a wig before, this one is really realistic looking, so I’m happy about that! The cap is prett small and snug fitting and the tracks show in the back, but overall it looks and feels like real hair. Might try taking the braids down and straightening it like I’ve seen others do, but overall pleased.
3	Made well but missing magnets in the bottom. Would hold up very well.
3	Seams started splitting after about 2 weeks.
3	Very cute, my 3 year old loves it. However it’s smaller then I expected. He’ll only be able to wear for 1 season instead of this fall too.
3	They don't really help with the glare at night on rainy days as much as I would like. But it just could be I am getting old.
3	I read this material some years ago and loved it then. Now it seems wordy and old.
3	Works great, but took forever to arrive
3	Have had this case before - durable.
3	It's an IR blaster.. it does the work.no more, no less.
3	This product works well and helped me identify some bad wiring by a contractor. So it handles it's purpose. Two things I wish were different. 1. The LED numerals are still much to bright even on the lowest setting. 2. The product is much to shallow. If you are going to use it in a rack mounted environment, then it should be fine. However if you are going to use it in a stack, it is much to shallow to stack anything on top of, hence it must go on top. I wish they had a full depth version. See pics
3	Some of the letters easily would release the air trapped inside, two of the letters did not have hole where I could put air inside I had to go out and buy another banner to replace those letters because I was not able to find single letters sold separately
3	Loud. I bought this hoping it would be quieter than my original, but no. I guess noise is just inherent in this type of cooler.
3	Dead skin began to come off on day 3. Maybe I have "good" feet, but not much came off. I was expecting more. I was left with several areas of "thick" skin. There are many brands of these, maybe the brand makes a difference.
3	Fits more like loungewear than lingerie
3	This item should have no slip pads on it.
3	The handles strip easily. Not a good selection of colors.
3	This was a good story but seemed to drag on and on. They are a couple of my favorite characters but the book was probably 50 pages too long
3	Really liked until it the key ring pulled off
3	the leather parts are very nice. the plastic parts crack and chip easily
3	I loved the first part of living with the Indians .I didn't, like last part ,he left his son too long .
3	Prompt customer service but the straw didn’t fit the size of the bottle
3	I will use these two up, but the smell of both are too strong.
3	cant seem to get them tight around the skis end up sliding up and down the ski... they function ok but wish they would grab better
3	The mount does OK. The problem is that with that many joints it doesn't keep its aim. Used it with a GoPro Session on a long tour about a sportbike and I found myself adjusting it every stop or just removing it because the extra drag made my neck sore.
3	These are nice but a little tight for my thick hair.
3	This is my first review of over 100 items purchased. Seal was broken and product appeared to be old. I've used it for months and it works fine.
3	Was from UAE. While it would work, not all my credit cards would work with Samsung Pay.
3	Have ordered these four times because one square is the size I need. they work fine but break after a few uses.
3	Doesn't close all the way. Leaves get into your tea. Hard to dump out after use. Ok purchase
3	Rear passenger side switch works after you play with it a little
3	THE SELLER HAS BEEN SENDING THE PRODUCT EVERY SINGLE MONTH, REGARDLESS THAT WE CANCELLED IT 3 MONTHS AGO. IT IS A BAD BUSINESS PRACTICE.
3	Works 50% of the time. The cable is low quality and the unit runs very hot
3	This series is threatening to be as silly as the Reality TV one, so I stop here. If there is one more in the Target Practice series, I may come back.
3	Comes with zip ties. Looks good. Delivered as and when stated. Will provide feedback after 30 days of use with photos. Until I actually use it will give it 3 stars as I don’t have an opinion yet.
3	Bought to replace as i like the size
3	It is extremely small and it might fit a 2 year old girl but definitely not a four year old. I have to return the item.
3	I purchased this because I love the idea and benefits of a copper water bottle. However, it's proving impossible to keep the oxidation at bay - I'm finding this is adding a musty smell/taste to my water. I can scrub the bottle up to a point, but polishing down inside isn't happening.
3	Love the scent (smells like root beer to me) , as many reviewers have posted, but my hair is a little bogged down when i use these products. Nice for a change every once in a while, but i can't use them day after day. I have to use another shampoo to remove the residue. Healthy shine, but not for everyday use in our house.
3	I know this is fake but I wanted a fun case to use when I carry my LV purse. I change phone cases and phones and didn’t want to spend the money on a real LV case that I won’t have for long because my phone gets updated. This works.
3	They were cute but kept falling when I walked
3	Good day I have not gotten the product yet but will let you know the minute we get it and try it out.
3	These are ok for the price. They do not turn up as loudly as I would like.
3	I'd like this better if I could purchase the cedar spice separately. The only way I've seen to get it is to by a 2pack with the birch wood scent.
3	They fall off my sons face
3	I ordered this because I remembered being fascinated with this trinket in my childhood. This Drinking Bird dips like it is supposed to, but its dipping motion causes it to scoot all over the surface - including off the table before you know it. The product does not include the cup, either. For the minimal cost, not a big deal, but I think there are better models available. I should have studied the options more carefully.
3	Just another power bank. Went camping, left it out in the sun all day, didn’t really charge at all. The light is pretty good though.
3	Great bag for keeping your hands dry of moisture and sweat while bowling. Only drawback was on initial use there was a ton of rosin and very shortly after there wasn’t much coming out of the bag when squeezed and patted in hands or over finger holes.
3	I like that this product is perfect for traveling purposes, but it’s not the best to remove wrinkles very quickly. Also, sometimes it spills some Of the water inside, regardless of how you hold it. Good, but not great
3	I returned it, I don't have the same shape as the women in the picture. or I just have bad self esteem.. I didn't like it, but all the girls in the reviews looked so good! jealous.
3	Lightweight but not as comfortable as I had hoped
3	These are awesome mittens good for hanging onto the steering wheel in just going into town and for fashion they will not keep your hands warm for a long time they are not very thick they are thin but very beautiful I bought these just to go into town and back for fashion fashion fashion...
3	That it came fast,but the nuts that is supposed to with the bolts are not here.
3	Case works great but the clip breaks easily.
3	Very small and compact. Not the best suction on hard floors. I own a cleaning company and was expecting better suction. The carpet seemed better but what is this machine missing. I don't like the thought there is still dirt in the carpet due to the lack of suction.
3	nice but too small and cover drops off when pot is tipped to pour the last half of tea. broke the knob off the cover.
3	Kinda confusing putting together, weird little x marks on cardboard that aren’t for anything? And it looks a little different than the picture, more cheapy looking. Hopefully my teddy bear hamster gets more used to it, it kinda shook a little bit when she got on but she is a lil chubby
3	It was inexpensive and very cheaply made.
3	Display to small. Hard to set stations.
3	I did like it this was second one I bought. Had it 3 months used twice stopped charging . Cant get it to charge at all it's dead. Not happy
3	I love the board and the stand that it comes with along with options of different letters and shapes. I would have given this 5 star but am so upset about slicing open my hand with the cutting tool that was sent to cut out some of the words. Why didn't these come precut like the individual letters?? Caution when using the tool - I actually was sliced by the tension bar in the middle, not the blades. There are multiple pieces that didn't come precut and when you apply pressure to cut these out, the bar can slip and pinch you. In the process of this happening to me it also snapped "December" in half.
3	Good price. Our son who is 34 lbs now tore it jumping about 6 months ago. So I would say it doesn’t last long.
3	Would be awesome if the box wasn't crushed. Looked at the figure, and it's awesome otherwise. Look at how upside down it arrived.
3	It's too small and I don't think it can fit everyone and the quality is not that good and don't deserve the asking price
3	Well built and attractive but VERY slow. It takes two to three times as long as other toasters we have had.
3	I regularly purchase this lip gloss, but this was the first time I purchased it online rather than in a store. I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but every time I use this on my lips I end up with a line that runs around the inner part of my lips. It appears approximately 30 minutes to an hour after applying and I have no idea what causes it.
3	Pump is strong but pretty loud humming sound .
3	I got this as a gift for my grandson - looked like a great set online - I liked the price and I liked the variety of stuff included - I liked that it had wheels - HOWEVER, when it arrived, the box looks "used" - the box has tears where the handle connects - the box was not sealed. it looks like it has been opened several times - not overly pleased with that . That is why I didn't give it more stars If the box looked new and sealed, I would have given it 5 stars, but I'm suspicious that this set has been returned. Bummer!
3	Hard to install the back
3	Used to hang random tools. Worked pretty well.
3	The blew up fine once we filled them with helium. Although there were only 40 balloons in the package rather than 50 like the package stated.
3	I liked the whole concept of this product and thought it would organize my Keurig k-cups, and it did. You have to work with it to get it to close straight though. Being a tad OCD I noticed immediately the gap at one end. It is not a big deal probably, but it drives me nuts to pay for something and then it doesn't work as described.
3	These work great. Seal real tight. I expected them to be bigger though.
3	I can’t say I was in favor of the flavors. But they are healthy.
3	It's so tiny, and difficult to keep the light on.
3	When I purchased these I was unaware the cords didn't retract. The quality of the device is very good both in sound and build. I wrote a review that I was disappointed in the cords not retracting and the company responded 100%. I will definitely purchase more from them in the future.
3	Received today. It’s just as picture shows. Excited. Removed film and placed on phone, adhesive is next to none. Socket is very stiff to open and close and either trying to open or weight of phone causes separation of pop socket from my phone case. Dang
3	Dog likes it but he sleeps in my bed
3	I like that it doesnt stain But its not waterproof
3	You advertise hepa bags in both your wording and your pictures. But you shipped and I received just micron bags not the Hepa one's pictured or worded in your listing.
3	I got the case but it didn’t come with the screen protector..
3	my apple tv 4k has fallen off twice - not sticky enough to last
3	happy with the product.
3	So the 4 or IV is wrong. Displayed as IIII - I cant believe I didnt notice. I knew something was off. It didnt look quite right and then I realized the typo. It's actually on the image. Otherwise it's a nice cheap clock. There is no tick.
3	We are very happy with the chairs, it’s the shipping we are disappointed in. Delivery was 3 days later than what was originally stated. I know 3 days doesn’t sound like much but when you package doesn’t arrive on the day expected, disappointment. Each day that passes and still no delivery, even more disappointment and anxiety.
3	The supplied adhesive pads do not stick to the supplied magnets very well. If you use this on your fridge, you will come to find the board on the floor and the magnets still on the door...Using gorilla glue now.
3	way bigger then expected
3	I swim laps for an hour every day using an indoor pool and it's very boring so I use the radio to help. I have used other swimmer radios that worked better but seem to have been discontinued so I bought this one but it doesn't work as well.
3	The screen protector does not fit properly there is air remaining on the edges
3	The sizing is different than the pairs I've bought in the store. They are longer and larger.
3	I am not sure why I thought there would be some writing/guide/stories, but it is a lined diary, with a cool cover, and that is all.
3	I expected better Not great around walls. Constantly shuts off doesn't seem to be able to navigate around objects real well (inset doors)
3	Pretty, but poor quality. One wash and they started to break.
3	Again interesting enough to get the 3rd book
3	Not really a movie plays more like a promo for the game so it doesn't end
3	I love the watch case. However I order ebony got reddish brown color wood. I emailed the shipper and never heard back. Great product poor shipper.
3	Ordered a Large received an extra small. Homecoming in 2 days and this is the last thing we needed 👎🏽
3	Works only as a slow charger not USB 3.0 fast charging, I'm using Samsung original fast charger.
3	This tape is "okay". The adhesive and color of the tape is fine. Compared to other gaffers tapes I've used this tape feels thinner, seems harder to tear precisely, and tends to tear into thin strips too easily. I prefer Pro-Gaff gaffers tape instead of this Fasten product.
3	Didn’t meet my needs. My own fault for insufficient research.
3	Has a plastic tip in the top that scrapes the top of whatever you’re trying to dust. Needs a lot more “fluff” to completely cover& pad the plastic point. I would’ve kept it otherwise
3	My dachshund loves to be covered up and this is perfect for her. However, the place for the tubing was sown shut which defeats the entire purpose. It’s a decent purpose but if your dog doesn’t like to be covered, don’t risk it being sown shut.
3	The small was too small for my 14 pound dog exchanging.
3	Would prefer solid stoppers...too flexible
3	Maybe I expected too much but this is a pretty flimsy item.
3	Scoop is too big. Seriously. I only use 1 scoop per serving when I drink this
3	Would of gotten 5 stars but liquor flask fell out.. but I still use it and it looks good...
3	Cute but falls off the phone pretty easily.
3	I was disappointed in how the book ended. She could have expanded more on the storyline of Celine dealing with her cancer and her relationship ending with her husband. It's not one of her better published works.
3	I have never ordered this brand but heard great things, not sure if those brown areas are normal or not
3	Took this out after a week... very course and knotted very easy. Giving 3 stars because the issue is personal others may not mind..
3	By far my favorite battery case to date. I usually just buy a cheap one and use it until it quits and then on to the next. This one, however continued to charge my phone two or three times on a charge until today the lightning pin broke off. I was just going to re-order but it looks to be unavailable. Now I have to hunt for a new favorite.
3	I really want to love this product but it caused me major skin rash. The rash wont go away after a month and still suffering. Pretty disappointed.
3	I have had them for a couple of weeks and one has quit on me already. When it worked the motion sensing was surprisingly good and they were pretty bright.
3	It's very pretty, but I gave it to my teenager because it didn't fit me. Bummer...
3	It's a great series, but I haven't been able to watch because they are international and my dvd player won't play them.
3	MY MICROWAVE IS PLASTIC ON ROOF INSIDE SO IT DOES NOT STICK UP THERE
3	This cap looks patterned, but the cap we were sent was solid purple which was disappointing. We could not return it.
3	Good reach. The pick took is sturdy. I’d buy again if the floss was able to glide better and do so without fraying.
3	I knew what I was getting, it is just a wall hanging and it works well for that purpose however as others have stated it is impossible to get the folds out. I have had it hanging for several days in hopes they would relax and I even tried steaming them but they don't come out so plan on a way to mount them where they are pulled tight or else you will have lots of fold lines.
3	This is my second time buying this hair and I can say that I am a little disappointed in the second round. The hair wasn’t that much of a wet and wavy texture like the last one I bought. The hair shedded especially when it was wet ( I didn’t experience it the first time) I only had the hair in for two weeks and I’m already taking it down. So you get what you pay for.
3	Good but does not stick well to life cases
3	The inspire HR fits fine, but the clip takes away the HR function and it also doesn’t track correctly. Many times I have tried wearing them while shopping and they tracked me as swimming!
3	Update to 3 stars Finally figured out how to get the machine working consistently again. 1st bought a new metal filter, the new design has a removable part so it no longer traps water inside. This did not fix the pressure problem, just the cleanliness problem. However, I started using a thumbtack to clean the drip point in the metal cup that holds the coffee. This aha moment did not come from customer care but has taken care of the problem. Originally I had this at 5 stars for making great cappuccinos. Went down to 1 star when it stopped working more than 50% of the time. Bringing it up to 3 stars as the machine seems good, but the experience with Customer Care and having to figure out how to get it working right was not awesome. Original review: Good: When it works it makes great espresso and cappuccinos. It is easy to clean, although the sealed metal filters that came with the machine would retain water. Bad: After a 9 months the pressure was insufficient to get the double shot to go thru. No change in coffee brand. Ugly: Spoke with their customer care several times, and it seemed more like they wanted to get me not to submit a claim against the warranty than to help. Just because it made 1 cup 1 time, does not mean it wasn't failing 95% of the times. I still don't know what's wrong with the machine, if it is fixable or not, but now its outside of warranty. Would not recommend.
3	This is really a good idea, however, my spice containers often fall out of the gripper clips.
3	This is okay. I kind of like this story. Hunter isn't exactly like what I would think a military man would be like (in his bodyguard business). He isn't alpha enough I guess is what I am saying. As for Gib he is just a little to gullible and naive to me. He needs to grow a pair.
3	These are good, although not my favorite flavor. I wanted to like these since they have coconut flavor in them, but the coconut flavor is too mild for my tastes.
3	I got bored this season
3	Went on easily but to much of an orange tone for me
3	I love Feast from the East but it’s to dam expensive...On Amazon....I was desperate at the time...found the same product at,reasonable price.
3	I hope that it lasts longer than the last shoulder bag I purchased!
3	Using essential oils on these wool balls doesn't really give the clothes much scent. Also, even using 3 balls in one load there was still static. Still like the fact that they're more natural than most dryer sheets though.
3	This item arrived quickly via Amazon Prime. The picture quality of this Blu-ray is decent. While the image holds it's definition on larger screens, there just doesn't seem to be any "remarkable" increase in sharpness or visual quality over the DVD. I found no issues with the audio presentation. Everything sounded perfectly clear. This season definitely sets itself apart in terms of style. Rich and vibrant colors are plentiful, and there is no shortage of music. Characters are well fleshed out and I found the writing to be adequate. Wes Bentley handles a leading role as best he can, but Evan Peters portrayal of the psychotic Mr. March was worth the price of admission alone. Series regular Jessica Lange did not return for this season, but her absence is barely noticeable. All in all, it's an interesting season. It's extreme in all the ways that a story about a hotel full of psychopaths, vampires and murderous spirits could be. While the presentation is not as vivid as I'd hoped to see on Blu-ray, the extra physical durability and slight visual uptick in picture quality delivered by the format still make this a solid choice over the DVD.
3	The concept was good. The problem is when you try to connect the magnets one at a time, they are so powerful they all snap together at the same time,away from the eye. Not just this brand but others as well. Being a trooper, I was determined to make these things work. I refuse to spend another dime on individual lashes. I even tried cutting them. After being frustrated for over week, I gave up. I can't imagine how some women are able to apply these lashes. I guess they don't work for everyone. I must admit they are beautiful lashes though.
3	Do not put in your tub OMG
3	These are alright. I really liked them at first because it's great to grab one to change baby on and they're small enough to keep in the diaper bag as extra protection when changing a messy diaper. The only problem is the waterproof layer on the back of pad is wierd after washing. I've never dried them so I'm not sure what is causing this to happen. It's as if it's delaminating. It feels as if it's melting or something. It really looks like what I would imagine would happen if I dried them on very high heat.
3	Within a week a piece of the black casing surrounding cover broke off, and the side where it is broken separate from its casing. Other than that the cover has protected my device so far.
3	Each section will hold a pair of flip flops comfortably, but most other shoes will need one whole section per shoe. The product images are misleading; there is definitely not that much space.
3	It was not for a montero mitsubishi 2006!
3	Its a little flimsy in the design characteristic
3	This seems like it’ll work really well with some work. The rubber stops are too tall, rendering the clamp too small to fit around the propane tank, I have no doubt it’ll be perfect once I mess with those rubber stops with a knife, but for this price it seems a little ridiculous the customer has to modify it before use.
3	A good medium roast. Bought for my husband. He has not found his favorite yet.
3	I usually wear 7.5 but I order 8w and it is small
3	Did not get the colors pictured
3	These notepads are difficult to write on with a Fisher Space Pen. It does work, but the writing is rather splotchy. Works great with gel ink (but may smear), and is alright with regular ballpoints. It repels water on the surface, but the edges allow water to seep in, so underwater writing may not be a good idea.
3	not really sure if it does anything. May be staining my towels as well.
3	But the plumper made my lips actually sting!
3	Work fine. However, shipped on a slow boat from China.
3	Definitely not the Disney versions if that's what you're looking for. Old versions of the movies. My daughter enjoyed some of them.
3	I didn’t realize it was a keychain and I got mad about the price. I should’ve looked but at Walmart it’s 13 bucks. 🤐
3	Slightly damaged but still works.
3	This movie should/must have a designed plot. My wife and I never found it. We wanted to like it more than we liked it. Not bad, not great like its cousins. There are good moments that might make it worth seeing, but a fair number of slow, weak ones where you wondered when is this movie picking up steam. I wouldn't buy, I'd rent. And I've bought all Harry Potters in blue ray or better. This one is my only almost regret.
3	I had an issue with the bag and they sent me another that is in great condition immediately!
3	It has a calming affect, but if you're looking to help with sleep issues, it didn't knock me out like other melatonin brands.
3	My case broke within a week of having it. I just taped it because I did not want to loose money. It finally gave out completely after 2 months. The back was great but the bottom was very flimsy.
3	For the price, I guess they are worth it. The metal is thin and the lid is not weather proof by any means. The lid is a single piece of metal that has the edges bent down and the corners of the lid are not even completely welded,they have gaps on the bottom edges.
3	Received totally different color.
3	Liked the pitcher but it came with crack--pitcher returned
3	This carrier was missing several parts, the whole back tire piece for a second bike. At first it wasn't an issue because I only attached the parts for one bike. But less than a month after using the carrier, the whole back tire piece fell off the carrier in transit to pick up the bike. Have no visual of the carrier when It is attached to the receiver on the back of my RV. Since the back tire part is the most lightweight piece of the carrier did not notice exactly when that piece fell off. Swagman, required me to provide pictures of the carrier. I attached a pic of the carrier assembled on the rack as well as all the parts for the second bike carrier that were still in the box. Stated in the form at Swagman.net that the parts for the second back tire part of the carrier were missing in the original shipment. Swagman sent me ONLY the back tire well but not the belt and buckle. When I called about that the woman was very curt over the phone. The strap and the buckle were sent but no directions on how to attach the strap to the tire well. In the assembly directions on Swagman.net there is no mention of attaching that part. A tech staff at Swagman told me that in the original shipment the belt and buckle are already attached to the tire well. When I asked if that part could be shipped assembled he said that wasn't possible. Googled you tube for directions without success. Basically I have a non-working carrier and the manufacturer doesn't seem to care that there's a major blip in providing good customer service. Unfortunately, there is no other bike carrier that is rated for transport for the back of an RV. But I cannot recommend this carrier due to the issue with pieces falling off the carrier when moving the trailer to pick up the bike.
3	Balloon looked great. We decided to fill it with air, not helium because we wanted it to sit on the floor. Filled it, looked great for 10 minutes, then seemed like it needed more air. When filling (all limbs, torso, head have separate air holes) the head popped. We fixed it for the party by putting a balloon inside and taping the face/head over it. No one noticed. Be careful filling!
3	I received my palm and it was infested with spider mites. I tried to get rid of them but this it was too late and I had to get rid of the plant. I hate to give a bad review because all the other plants I’ve purchased front costs farms have been wonderful. I’m wondering if there’s a way the company could assist with this but there is no contact info on the page.
3	Good looking but the steam power is weak. I assumed I could use for bathroom too but seems it’s more suitable for jewelery cleaning and maybe kitchen.
3	The product looks exactly as pictured. Once assembled it is a very nice addition to have.
3	I purchased this sweatshirt in white a size medium. I normally wear an xsmall but based on reviews decided to order a size medium. It fit exactly like the model. My complaint is that the white looks dingy. And after washing it there was that thing that happens to some whites. It was like a slight pink purple dingy hue compared to my beautifully white Nike sweatshirts. I just decided to keep it but next time I will make sure to visit a store when purchasing this brand. By the way, I’m 5’1 and the crop fit a tiny,tiny bit longer than the model even after washing. Nice heavy material but really bummed that it’s dingy.
3	Cute! But way too small. I bought a 9-12 month and it is the same length as Carters 6-9 except wider. Just size up especially if your child is average or larger than average size.
3	This didn't do much to help me sleep. I have fibromyalgia, so I have pretty bad insomnia. I find that other supplements have worked better. Also, it smells awful. Like a barn. I gave it 3 stars, because it might help people who need just a little help falling asleep. However, if you have bad insomnia, I would suggest trying something different.
3	I've used the pants and the shirt maybe less then a dozen times. I am now having issues with them turning off, and the batteries seem to be working fine. Don't understand. A couple days later now and I can't get the pants or shift to work.
3	I bought this to match an existing light fixture and it was a miniature version to the ones outside the garage door. I requested a return and they send me a shipping label and I returned it. They did not credit me the full amount and deducted shipping costs. This was not disclosed. I would have kept the fixture and installed it somewhere else.
3	Works as a humidifier great as a atomizer not so much... if you expect this to smell good like them little defusers your gonna b disappointed
3	Not as sticky as other ones I ordered, does work, good value for the money.
3	I like them but received two slotted and no regular larger one
3	It is NOT stainless steel as it says it is, but it is a good spoon for large pots of stew, chili, etc.
3	Helps with pain. May cause stomach upset. MSM may work better for me.
3	There’s really nothing wrong with this dress besides the color being a little bit off. I ordered the light pink and it’s more of a peach-ey orange instead of the light pink shown in the picture. The fit and quality are both okay but this is definitely a “get what you pay for” situation. I ended up returning the dress because it just wasn’t a good color on me.
3	Can’t really review. Item never arrived (lost by UPS).
3	If I had written the review directly after buying the product it'd be much different. At first I loved it, but a month later... -the ring spins and flops around loosely and is obnoxious because it now gets in the way and doesn't work as a kickstand so I can't set my phone down and look at anything because if I do it wobbles. I'll have to take it off this weekend and hope the adhesion didn't ruin my case. -also, it's pulling up on the sides a bit, it sticks but it also collects dirt.
3	The bristles on this brush were a little soft for my liking. Returned it for a refund.
3	Pins slip out of holder rather easily... otherwise seems good. Works for me
3	I like the price and the easy assembly but mine came with a piece on the A bar that was welded on crooked. I ended up having to use a hammer to get it togo into the B bar. All good now just that little bump in the road.
3	All of the leggings I have ever purchased have always been one size fits all/most, but these are the first ones that I've ever had trouble with. The ones I received were not very stretchy, especially in the waistband. They also had a very strong smell that lingered after the first wash. I guess they are fine for the price, but I would not buy them again.
3	All photos show 2 ant moats. Only 1 ant moat showed up. Please help!!!
3	Overall it works. The only minor issue i had was it leaks a little bit when you’re putting on a top loading water dispenser but other than, i say purchase it.
3	These bowls are nicely made but they are very small. They also have an order which I know my dog is not going to be able to get past. The item cannot be returned.
3	For a Asian man, I feel this wouldn't really suit me. I guess everyone have their own personal preference in scent. Might suit whoever is reading this review tho. Might.
3	The case tended to want to fall off my X and it showed every single smudge/fingerprint making it look dirty constantly.
3	They are beautiful. My only problem with them was that they didn’t hold up very well. As we are receiving them back, most of them are peeling apart.
3	It was a good price but it didn't help me but I am still using it so I'll update when the whole things is gone
3	I wish it had 3 more slots. The Happy Planner has 12 slots so I need to shift the paper down for this to work.
3	Feels a little awkward on the shoulders.
3	worked really well with my gate
3	Fit well but after a couple times wearing them his feet smelled awful They seem to be waterproof but we don't understand the bad smell because he has never had this issue before..
3	Lotion feels good, not greasy, and smells vey nice, but packaging leaves much to be desired. Much of it was in the bag when t arrived. Seller needs to fix this problem.
3	Note that they are not a full circle. The back is flat. I didn’t realize that before purchasing. Therefore they were much smaller than anticipated. Also, when they arrived they were much smaller from being condensed in the package. It took about 15 minutes for them to fully puff up to size.
3	Seems not like the ad, not easy to use . But quality is good.
3	Lures are great but I only received four of them
3	Three functions, the shaver is not that good, still able to shave with it but not as clear as I expected but it’s ok. The razer is perfect, I would rather us this one as razer than shaver. The nose one i didn’t try yet, but it should be fine.
3	I liked the smell of these, but while shipped, the lemongrass oil leaked all over the other oils. The labels on the other oils are saturated in lemongrass, and so is part of the box. I understand crazy things happen during shipping, but you would think they would do a better job packaging so this doesn't happen. I also have Doterra brand oils, which are often way more expensive than these, so I decided to give a different brand a try. These just aren't as good of quality, which should be expected from a cheaper brand of oils. They work great for aromatherapy. I wouldn't use them for topical use, but they all have a nice smell, so they will be mainly used in my diffuser which is what they said their product should be used for. I think that as long as yours don't spill during shipment, these are definitely worth the price you pay for them.
3	The story idea was good and so is the author's writing style, but for me there were too many things that didn't add up. Riley is supposed to be excellent as a profiler, but I didn't really view her insights as extraordinary. In fact, sometimes she's rather dim-witted, as evidenced by one of the later scenes in the book with the female patient. Most of the action seemed to be a frantic race from one place to another, where the minor characters ended up doing more of the rescuing or discoveries than the main characters. I didn't feel a lot of investment in the romance between Riley and Thayne either. Maybe it's because the reader doesn't get to see their attraction for each other from the beginning of their relationship.
3	They heat up real quick but they don't last as long as the description says.
3	The concept is good; just wished the entire strip would be adhesive. The ends do not so as such that area is slightly raised and knowing that was the case, I found myself constantly feeling it to ensure it wasn't obvious and sticking up. My first use was on the collar of my denim jacket. I will try another brand next time
3	did not feel comfortable, my foot slid off
3	I was highly frustrated at first with the collar and was getting ready to return. The directions are incomplete. I watched several videos with similar collars to figure it out. I could not get it to work with the testing set up. It would turn on then nothing. Tried a different battery, still the same. My dog was barking so much the day I was to return I figured just try it on the dog. Well, it works! I still can't get it to test properly as shown in videos and what I can make from the instructions. I have used it the past several days on vibration mode only. It seems to work on and off but enough to deter the barking.
3	My two month old baby did not let me put these on her
3	Ordered 2 of these got water in the first one just fine went to fill the second one and the when I went to open the little stopper it either ripped open or wasn't fully attached to begin with 😑
3	The product arrived as described. Everything about it was great but after the second use it developed a hole. Seller was quick to respond and offered to replace or refund. Reputable seller.
3	The pens arrived and they look classy but one of them appear defective and it makes a clicking sound when trying to write. Also, the pen with the removable cover feels a bit clumsy in the hand.
3	Looks good, easy, easy to assemble. Instructions and parts w/ Hex wrench included were shockingly easy to use and assemble. Overall solid parts, arms a little flimsy. Quality overall is very good. Head rest may prove to short even when adjust to it's highest position for people with broad shoulders and 'normal' torso length. Arms not very sturdy, not adjustable (I missed this in the description--my issue). Overall, for the price, will work for the time-being. Comfortable enough, but not a top tier product--quality = pricing so I'm happy.
3	Good bag, a little smaller than I thought it would be
3	These are cute story that cannot be published today because of stereotypes. This a shame because all stories should be taken in the context of the times they are written. Which is why very few people have actually read Mark Twain.
3	The actual Timothy hay was fine, but NO MARIGOLDS! I was so upset, as I wanted to give my buns a special treat and this just ended up being their regular hay.
3	Seems ok but they sent me the wrong color. Ordered black and got chestnut. And label says teeth whitening
3	I liked the product but the lid was a bit hard to get on. Always hand washed but it cracked after less than a year.
3	The first few times I wore this it was great- love the cups in it. After a few washes it does start to loosen and sag a little
3	Its a nice set, but the mallets won't fit in the bag for storage after they've been assembled.
3	I like the cup itself. I don’t like that it came broken.
3	My left side ear buds is not working
3	10 grams? 12,000 seeds? My scale shows a Net seed weight of 9.25 grams with a 1/2 gram allowance for the Exterior package plus label. No where near the published Ten (10) grams of seed. Should I dock the vendor a Star simply because they under-weighted, over calibrated? Holding back the 4th and 5th star pending germination event directly under a very thin layer of moist Coco coir in full sunshine. Ten (10) Amaranth seeds weigh less than 1/10th of an ounce. Will this batch count 12,000 as published? Stay tuned.
3	I tried putting on one of the hidden protectors and it cracked instantly! Hopefully the other one last
3	It was too large, and it was returned.
3	legs fit but waist was way too big
3	The fryer is the same as most, a decent fryer, my only complaint is the way it was shipped. It was literally the factory cool daddy box with a shipping label, so when it was dropped off, every person who went past my house saw a brand new fryer sitting on my step....thankfully someone was home soon after and it was not missing...but dangerous shipping in own box
3	Headlamp quit working on second day of use. Company refunded money.
3	not sturdy at all..like the layout just wish is wasnt so wobbly..
3	The tea tastes good but I'm not sure if it helped my supply at all.
3	This balm works well in getting rid of beard itch, but unfortunately, it smells horrible and the smell doesn't fade like other balm and oils I've tried. I was only able to use it a few times before tossing it.
3	Received all 4 plants, 1 is doing badly, another one is not doing great, we unpacked them as soon as we got them, they haven't needed water yet, I'm hoping a little time will perk them up, but after 3 days the one is almost dead. Im hoping we can salvage 2, I bought then for my daughters birthday.
3	The dark blue outfit rubs off on everything even after being washed and the material is thin. It would be good for a summer outfit but with winter coming she will need more layers. Sizing was accurate and they are cute.
3	I purchased these replacement wheels back in November 2018 and 1 of the wheels has already broken off.
3	This seems like a fun craft project, however there aren't clear instructions on how to get them onto the keychains!? Anybody else know?
3	Purchased this item based on Amazon reviews, which were proven true in every aspect. The only disappointment I have is that I accidentally dropped it in my sink at a distance of about 6-8 inches and the semi-circular plastic piece at the end of the housing of the grater broke and my husband had to glue it together. Would be helpful to use sturdier plastic.
3	It was smaller than I thought
3	Looks just like the picture. Fits nice and is well made. Only reason for lower rating is being the product absolutely reeks. I’ve laid it out in my home and I’m hoping that the smell goes away by my party on Saturday.
3	I ended up returning this because I felt the top as a little snug. I’m a size 14-16 and got an XL as suggested but the top was just a little to small. The bottoms were great! The material felt great though and the colors were bright! I hate it didn’t work for me!
3	Just what I needed. They will strip out if not epoxied or welded to your turner, they are what works though.
3	the pens work fine but the magnets can fall off easily.
3	I didn’t see much of a difference and it was pretty sticky
3	Works but difficult to read instructions as they are not complete and fine print. Better get a magnifying glass before.
3	Overall this is an okay product. You need to use two tripods/stands to support this slider to avoiding tilting when camera moves from one side to the other. You can set position A and B easily with the controller but they are gone after you power the thing off. Noise from the motor is loud. So it's not good for interview. The follow focus function only work well in the center part of the slider, as it gets close to the two ends, the rotation is not that smooth.
3	Cable are easy to use you can just plug it on to a fuse box
3	I thought these were the full color lights but they only have red, green, and blue light diodes. The remote shows multiple different colors but the actual result is just some combination of the three colors. The pre-programmed modes are pretty cool, and being able to have static lights or dynamic lights with changeable speeds is nice.
3	Works good. It was no headers soldered on the mainboard for the drives, so you can not extend the memory. SD card did not work at all.
3	Definitely cleaner than the one I took out, however, this is much thinner than the one I took out. It did fit, but honestly, I would spend the extra $2 or $5 and get the Mann one over this next time to get the thicker one.
3	Ok for what it's worth, I guess
3	Broke almost the first day. I dropped it and little pieces cracked off the corners. I’ve had multiple cases the same type as this one and didn’t have that problem. Not really happy with this other than it’s cute colors.
3	It does not stay on the elastic is extremely loose
3	Came in original box; no privacy. Any and every body at each location/post office saw and know our business. EVERY other order has been shipped in a discreet box/package with no details or description of what is in the package. Very disappointed in the delivery. PRIVACY SHOULD BE A TOP PRIORITY WHEN SHIPPING. No problem with the actual product.
3	This would be a really nice duvet cover, nice quality fabric easy buttons. But it showed up stained with green dye and bleach marks. I will be asking for a refund.
3	My husband liked this but preferred the fresh brand
3	I would eventually like to find just one Pork Pie hat that fits. Ordered the largest size, still didn't fit.
3	Awful quality! A piece of Junk! Much worse than I was expecting!
3	I could have written this online myself - not that much help in gathering thoughts. I paid for essentially nothing but a nice cover and perhaps the organization of information in one place.
3	Cant get these bulbs to connect what gives? All my other Govee products work just fine. I CAN get them to start blinking but nothing after that. If / when I get these things to connect, the 3 star will change to 5 star. Wish me luck!
3	I thought this was going to be bigger then what it was.
3	These are great shoes! My husband found them to be super comfortable, except that the lack of 1/2 sizes led to an issue with fit. He usually wears a 9.5. We tried both size 9 and size 10 hoping that one would fit but had to return both pairs. We would recommend these shoes as long as you don’t normally wear 1/2 sizes.
3	Painstakingly verbose. It dragged on and on. But, it provided the author’s thoughts on the perspective of the men who wrote the Declaration and events of the time.
3	were not neoprene as stated, cheap foam.
3	The cover is not fully waterproof as it seems whatever is in contact with the material when it rains will soak in some moisture (kind of like whatever touches the side of a tent when it rains will get damp). The cover is larger than I thought and has a lock of straps and tie downs to help secure it. Good material, not sure if it will last more than 2 years in the elements.
3	Very pourous and not meant for chalk pens
3	well we got his to help maintain the fur of two cats who live with us, however this gloves are too stiff and well maybe not that good for cats or maybe our cats are not fan of the gloves. maybe a dog will enjoy them. No single complain about the quality so is kind of disappointing because but is more because of the temper of our cats than the product itself. no other use could be found for them so well all things for these cats is a flip of a coin, some stuff they love and some other like this is not appreciated. So good luck with your own cats have in mind they are really complex beings.
3	Hard keeping up with the characters
3	The grip/tightness when wearing could be better. Glasses slide off my face when looking down. But still a good buy for the price.
3	I like the durability, easy to clean only problem is getting it to lay flat on one end from being rolled Up. Any suggestions would be great 👍🏼
3	the base of the three leashes comes unclipped too often. could not use
3	My dogs are starting to listen but only has one Setting and if your dog can stand the first and second shock it doesn’t shock any more just beeps
3	It's a wonderful thing to have but I got it for less.
3	I just got this product this week and have been taking it with Vitamin C 1000 mg for a few day so far nothing is happening to me yet. will update more after 1 bottle.
3	I bought this for my son’s jungle theme nursery. We have the monkey and lion cubes and love them. However, the elephant basket looks like a mouse. Maybe if the trunk had more of a contrasting color to the body, it would be better. I wish this had worked because I like the quality, but I will be returning.
3	They're cute. My kids loved furby booms. But they broke in 2 months. So I bought furby connects instead. This time a bigger problem was their hair, which is falling out all over the house. I was confused if I raised a dog or a cat. I missed furby booms....but too easy to break. And I can't buy them in my country any more. I took the furby connects back from my kids and hid them. Sad....
3	It's cute and a good size but not even enough balls to cover the bottom of the mat
3	I got 12 bottles of polish. All of the colors were great, except for Cast a Spell, which didn’t actually have any polish in it.
3	Super cute, but broke within two months.
3	I was really disappointed by this stuff. Some reviews said it was great for fine hair, but unfortunately, it made my very fine hair greasy and weighed it down. I’ve used a very small amount and tried it for a few weeks, but it just isn’t working for me. It would probably be ok for semi-fine hair, but my search for a shine and anti-frizz product that works on truly super fine hair continues!
3	It does what it is suppose to do. You have to assemble it yourself.
3	This is not long lasting as its said. You can buy non long lasting for better that give the same quality and scent. How do I know this? Cause I have tested in Ulta and they have two different types each yield different scents and price. At Ulta long lasting does last longer.
3	The light covers were fine but I received a mixed batch of hardware to install them...
3	Good acting and great cinematography with a decent storyline. Unfortunately the writing and I suppose directing were botched. Too many unbelievable holes in the plot made this tale average fare.
3	Substantial and seemed well made, but had a peculiar smell to it. I'm pretty sensitive to odor, and since my head would be lying against it, that just didn't work for me so I had to return it.
3	It uses the suitcase method of having more or less space with a 2 side zippers. When the zippers are unzipped the hold space is deeper and when zipped it is smaller or not as deep. The dividers are nice if you are a travel artist and want to keep your supplies in one space. Sturdy materials and clean design. Can hold regular size pens and pencils and very small brushes.
3	I like the shades very much. I ordered 3. One of them will not stay up. It keeps coming down. I even got some double stick carpet tape which is extremely strong. I applied it, but it came down again. What do I do to get another one without paying for it. This shade is faulty.
3	These are very cute. My only drawback with them is that they don't wipe clean. Look stained rather quickly. They are nice quality other than that.
3	Didn’t notice any difference during stormy weather
3	Good product but smaller that I excepted.
3	The night vision/IR does not work. Returning product.
3	The disk drive tray has the two slots as expected, the larger DVD slot is perfect but the mini disk slot is NOT deep enough to keep the game disk stable. It'll knock loose easily and damage the disk so I suggest transferring the game disk onto a USB drive, or a larger disk, if you have the knowledge. And the battery does NOT last to 5 hours, even with a full charge! We've been getting maybe a little over an hour of play with it but so far it has not played a single full movie so I think we might have gotten a bad battery. The game controller works very well and is easy enough to use for a toddler so happy with that. The sound is great, as well as the video playback. Overall, it's okay but it definitely needs a slight upgrade to the mini disk slot and a second check on battery life before shipment.
3	Good, soft rock. However already getting holes
3	Maybe it's the color, but it seems to get dirty really quickly and the closure is cracking. Bought it to replace a similar one bought from Amazon. Wish I had the old one back.
3	Dented at the bottom when it arrived. Otherwise it looks alright
3	I do get really tired of reading what everyone had for breakfast every day, and every time a horse gets groomed.
3	Ok but nothing to get existed about.
3	String gets consumed too quickly and has often broken right at outlet holes of trimmer head requiring removal and rewind. The square profile is just a gimmick to save material. I'm going to buy a solid cross section string next time.
3	None of the snacks he liked
3	If you're purchasing this duvet cover for your king duvet comforter, please note that it's for king AND california king. So, my king duvet comforter did not fit inside the duvet cover properly and left a lot of empty room that is super annoying / looks bad.
3	Haven't had a chance to use it yet.
3	Great product helped my pain but after 3 weeks started to turn my wrist green and coating is coming off
3	I’ve never had one of these that needs paper odd inside. If I had realized that I wouldn’t have bought this kind. It’s an extra step and chance fir a mess so I don’t like it
3	I usually order a large but it was way to tight so I exchanged for an X-large which is still light. It's too fitted and also to long by about 4". I'm 5'6 to give you an idea. Only positive thing I have to say is its cotton and I'm hoping it stretches after a few wears and washings.
3	So, the paper itself is great. It has a nice feel to it, keeps food from sticking. Overall great product. My problem is with the box. The method they have of cutting the paper sucks. I feel like I'm destroying both the paper roll and the box when trying to cut the paper. It's always a real situation. I don't need to be in a real situation just trying to cut parchment paper. Goodness.
3	My wife enjoyed this movie. It's entertaining though totally unrealistic. Everyone knows who the criminals are, almost everyone in the movie is a criminal, and they don't get caught and get what they go after. I'd never have picked this movie, she liked it.
3	Great informational guide BUT the recipes aren’t allergy friendly. Dairy and eggs are required for most recipes, two very common allergens, especially for those looking to heal leaky gut.
3	UPDATE AT END. Used this on my 2017 escape and it couldn't have gone smoother and took about an hour. I would suggest getting some large heat shrink tubing for the extra wire that stays behind the taillights, you can hear a slight rattle if you don't. /// I had to replace this after using for 2 years because the control module s#*t the bed.
3	Package arrived on time but with full of wrinkles! The dress doesn't look exactly like picture.You can see the strings out of the dress.I tried with 3 hoop petticoat but still didn't suit well...After a week,I noticed on daylight that lining mesh layers were torn.Ordered for my daughter's Birthday but am returning it.Not impressed for the paid price!
3	Well I should have read the reviews before reading, this is just a tease of what’s to come. Definitely has me ready to read the actual book, I can’t wait.
3	Arrived On time, but it (larg one) leaks
3	I tried it a few times. Quite honestly, I got better results with Dove Sensitive. It didn't keep me as fresh.
3	Nice summer mat, very colorful but a bit thinner than what I expected for the money. I love that they have a matching flag but the wipe-ability is non-existent, (sand, grass, yard dirt) Zero absorbency due to the thinness and the edges have already started to curl, and it’s under a covered porch.
3	not all cables we have will work with this Charger. hit or miss.
3	The smell is amazing and fills a room VERY well...the only problem I had is it wouldn't burn the last 20% of the candle. The candle is there and the wick is there but it won't light anymore. If it would have burned to the end of the candle it would have received 5 Stars from me, even though the price was good since it wouldn't burn all the way I felt a little jipped
3	Easy to install and it charges quickly. However, actual run time is a lot less than the OEM battery.
3	Short in the sleeves but I still like it
3	I was about to run out of this mineral. So, as usual, I bought it from Amazon. I knew that this was not a Prime item and that it was not sold directly or shipped by Amazon. Of course, I did not know that this seller was a Slow Turtle Shipper... Apparently, Amazon did not know it either. The seller was/is WooHoo Natural. And, it was never mentioned anywhere that this item was in back order! Otherwise, I would have bought from another - more expensive - but, well stocked seller. This slow seller did not forget to ship: It took exactly 31 days to ship! A genuine turtle from the pond turned shipper would have been faster...
3	Fun games but don't play new Extravagant Easter...ripoff. Lose 1 billion and win 20 million. Texas Tycoon is best option.
3	These tablets work fine, but I was disappointed that they come individually wrapped, since they claim to be "eco-friendly". They say the wrapper is recyclable, but it would be better to not have it at all!
3	A bit thicker than expected but quality product.
3	It kicks me out of a match so much times
3	I thought these would be more exfoliating.. They are too soft for my liking.
3	My 5 year old really loves this! Doesn’t leave a mess and easy to put away. However. After about using it 4 times. The sand is sticking to her hands.
3	The belts are very cute and fit great
3	Just ok. There are better out there.
3	Buttons move around a little too much even when you clean your screen and dry completely off but still can be used to play games (not good for Minecraft)
3	I really like the look of these, and they are no so heavy to where when they get wet they will take forever to dry. First thing I did notice is they slip really bad on my tile floors. I am going to have to get some sort of non slip to put under. The color is spot on. - Update- Once these rugs warmed up and the rubber material on the backside was no longer cold from being outside, they stick to the floor perfectly and no longer slip.
3	Won't be buying these again. Way to sweet. The Walmart brand much better.
3	2 of the 3 hooks came off
3	I had to buy something for a Flapper party so this looked good. When it arrived in a little envelop I had to laugh. It looked like a little black chicken feather drooping from a cheap black band. I'd save my money and look elsewhere unless you are a little girl playing "dress up". Even then...
3	not my favorite. i tried these instead of what i normally use. i had to go back to my normal stuff. these just didn't work as well. they did work but i wanted quicker results. i don't need things like this often but when i do i want them to work quick and as expected. these would probably be perfect for people that have more delicate GI tracks then i do.
3	These look nice but didn't really stick that well. Most of mine fell down, with weight of less than two pounds, though a few stayed up. Also I did not see any instructions in the box on how to properly install these
3	I do really like this product. I love the concept and feel good that I'm not using plastic but mine started fraying after only a few times used. I wish they were just a smidge more durable for repeat use. It works better for some things than others but is still a good product.
3	Works if you are not putting any stress on cable. Also magnets not strong enough! I have an defender otter box and the rubber that covers the iPhone charging port pushes the cable off every time, disconnecting the power! If you have no restrictions to your micro USB port or lightning port and don’t put any stress on the cable, then it works fine.
3	The straps are hard to fasten due to placement of holes. I put in gel inserts for dancing
3	The material isn't as good of quality as I was hoping for but the color is pretty.
3	Was not that quiet, had a ticking sound that accompanied it. My flat iron stopped working for a while and i thought it was fried, but when i came back to the US it seems fine, but i don't trust this step down converter strip
3	I find that the product meets all expectations except that it flakes. That was never mentioned in description of lip sense. Every one that I have flakes after a few hours.
3	Doesn't work well with staples that have curled up, a claw remover would have worked better.
3	I purchased this for my 4 year old grandson and 5 yr. old granddaughter. Maybe the card game is better suited to kids a few years older. Mine were bored after about 5 minutes.
3	These earbuds seem fine except within the first week or two, two of the four were broken. The earbud part popped off of the wire part. However I’m sure my kids were not being very careful with them..
3	As advertised light fabric.
3	I purchased these as insurance against the potential need to make a 12 hour drive at night - possibly in the rain. As it was, my DIL went into labor mid-morning, and only a portion of my drive was in the dark - and fortunately no rain. I have since used them to negotiate traffic in the rain, both at night and on a cloudy, dismal evening. I can’t say they made a huge difference, but I know they helped. Considering my paranoia about driving on unfamiliar roads and highways on dark, rainy nights, I’m going to conclude that they helped to reduce my apprehension.
3	Very uncomfortable. The back causes blisters
3	Not the softest material. inexpensive and good value, but prefer a softer feel
3	My daughter loves this dress and she’s in the ALL THE TIME. Durability is not so great because it started to fall apart after a week of daily use :(
3	$30.00 for four channels is poor cost-benefit ratio.
3	i have them in on shepherd hooks in my side flower bed. I like the size and shape-- but they burn through batteries quickly.
3	Neck too long for smithing, good hammer though.
3	Item runs small. I advise who ever purchases it should buy one size up.
3	The quality on this product has fluctuated a lot the past year or so. Sometimes the bag is half full of crumbs, sometimes the treats are over cooked. The product used to be awesome but they seemed to change the recipe and now they just crumble. My dog still likes them.
3	giving it a 3 simply because, like another reviewer mentioned, the LG dryer has a grate at the bottom and this didn’t do well at catching that build-up. i’m sure it works great with other brands (or types if this particular LG is the only one that has a grate) but for me, no go. i got angry at it and ended up trying to use a long straw cleaner...don’t try that unless you strap it to your hand - it’s now hanging out at the bottom of the grate cuz i dropped it and all i really wanna do is dry my sheet so i can go to bed. such is life.
3	I was nice looks great but the strap popped and the bag still look good. It need to be more tighter
3	Due to toe inflexibility, shoe cuts at toes and gives impression of being shorter. Wrong color was shipped. Will have to return.
3	The flashlight works great but the USB charging port has never charged the batteries.
3	Probably would not purchase in the future.
3	I ended up not even using it. It was useless for handles mounted in the middle of drawers. I ended up making my own templates out of craft paper. It would be OK for corner mounts, especially if you are not handy.
3	I found that it ended up damaging my pimples when it came to removing the patch. This caused more pimples to form.
3	I ordered the tan velvety and received the black. I have to give as a gift on dec 20. Disappointed
3	These clothes are junior sizes not adult and I am 5'5 1120 lbs, too small so I will give it away. Also, PINK products have a pink tag, this was tag less so it is not genuine
3	Looks great but have not tried it yet,,, Very Expensive for the amount of Salsa!!!
3	it's fine except for the unending squeaking noise it makes..
3	These were a bit dimmer than I expected. I ended up using them in a different picture than I intended. I am giving them three stars because every bulb has lots of scratches towards the top. Looks like they were rolling around on a rough surface at some point. This is unfortunate because it is very obvious when the lights are on. Packaging was well.
3	I've been using this for a few weeks. There was a tear a week in where the Velcro thumb strap wraps around. It's supportive and does what I need it to while wearing it. The large Velcro strap can get stuck to my clothes, which is frustrating.
3	Because of the breathable mesh weave it's easy to wear the watch without your skin turning "funky" the magnet could be a touch stronger because the band would loosen up with heavy activity however never became too loose. Normal wear of the paint from the metal. Had to stop using because the mesh pulled apart from the pin holder.
3	I love the speaker, sound and battery life but it didn’t come with the block to charge it. I bought one for my other daughter last year and it came with more accessories. A little disappointing.
3	Thread started to come off after few use.
3	This product was not what I needed for my dark spots.
3	the brush is flimsy so the lines are hard to make straight, otherwise it stays on great!
3	I was entertained but also frequently annoyed by the main character, her love interest, her best friend and the direction of the story.
3	This coffee pot does not seem to make really hot coffee, like it otherwise.
3	bought it as a present
3	Love the artwork, but looks cheap. Put it in a room with low lighting so you can't see how cheap it looks.
3	Was easy to put on. But I can't open the clasp? I ve tried to pry it open and it wont come apart. Frustrated.
3	Ordered beige and came in brown!!! Didn't expect these are so big!
3	I fit in a medium size underwear so I got a medium sized bathroom should have got a large or extra-large
3	One of the buckets came broken. In overall I like it. Will update my review once I get the replacement
3	The instructions are not in English.
3	It's a coiled telephone cord -- what's not to like? It does what it's supposed to do. Except that it's been off-gassing something terrible. I don't know what chemicals it's made with, but they can't be good; after an entire week, this cord has been smelling up my entire kitchen and even giving me a slight headache when I use it. I'm afraid to ask what I'm breathing in.
3	Its just okay to me. Didn't hate didn't love it. Its kind of flimsy.
3	Arrived with many so far melted!
3	Product outer frame was cracked, I don’t have time to return, had to use electrical tape to fix for my trip.
3	Used these as a liner for reusable doggie panties. They didn't stick very well to the panties and were very small and thin. They did help keep some of the blood off of the panties but the majority of it was in the diaper. I'd reccomend this for a small dog but I feel regular women's panty liners are a better option especially for a large dog in heat.
3	Nice case but a bit too big for my intended use.
3	Works good but does not last. Followed the directions and within 3 days it washed off and looked the same
3	I've been using it for a couple of weeks, and haven't noticed a very big difference yet... I'll keep at it and update my review if necessary.
3	Hard to review this one. At times it kept me wanting to turn the next page. And other times I was trying to decide whether to finish it or not. There were some decent twists, but often times the plot and characters were too over the top and too unbelievable. All in all I would rate it average.
3	I bought this to mount to a Molle vest but although it says it is Molle compatible, it really isn't. The belt slide mount on the back does have sort of a clip feature, that in theory could clip to one mole loop, but when you try to mount this way it is a flimsy mount and not secure. The knife and sheath are nice for the price - I would have given it 4 stars (a 5 star knife costs much more than this!) but for the fact that I was looking for a knife that easily mounts to my Molle, and this said it does . . . but it doesn't!
3	aluminium is super thin but everything fits.
3	Cool jacket but it didn't really fit me so I gave it to a friend. Very short and wide/puffy.
3	It works best but dimensions are not standard, left the gap of about 1/2” or little more when fitted, I had put some additional insulation to fill in that gap. Otherwise okay so far. Wife’s says air quality feels better , so have to take her word for it :)
3	2nd update: Emailed the owner of the company and he apologized for the charger. He stated that occasionally they have a faulty device out of the factory. He refunded the whole amount to me and sent me a 10% discount on a new one. He's an honest businessman. Update: Charger will not turn on now. I've owned it only a few months and for some reason I can't get it to turn on. Worked pretty good. Recharged my phone from 30% and charged a little bit later on then ran out.
3	This bra is the softest thing I've ever felt. I'm nearly 8 months pregnant and I didn't want to take it off. However, after probably 18 hrs of wear it's all stretched out and needs a wash. Guess it's a trade off.
3	The number one thing to mention on this case is that the inside area where it will make contact with the back of your phone feels rough like sand paper. I bought two of these and both were the same, so it was not a one off thing. I wound up leaving the plastic wrap cover that came on the phone, on the back to keep the gritty inside back from possibly scratching the phones back. I wish the inside had just been smooth gel because the point of getting the case was to keep the back from getting messed up. Other than that, the cases fit very well and seem like they would provide some protection from a short distanced fall, like if it landed on the corners of the phone.
3	Rather uncomfortable on the ear, battery lasts an okay amount of time, but gives you basically no time between "battery low" and "power off"
3	Although purchased for my daughter as a stocking stuffer, she liked it. I can't see the value in it. Packaged cheaply in a small plastic ziplock.
3	Whoever designed this bottle has never used it. Can’t pour out without spilling, even when using a funneL unless you are directly pouring it into a tank. I mixed drops of this with gallon jugs which becomes a sloppy mess. Where’s the economy if you are spilling this stuff?
3	Factory Dodge part. Should have been on car from factory. Look the same as non functional scoops. Small opening under hood, not sure they do much to lower under hood temps. A bit slow shipping from this vendor.
3	The material over all is really good quality! I weight about 180, 38C, and am about 5’4. I got the XXL and the body part fit good but the bra did not cover at all. I had side boob hanging out everywhere and when i would try to cover it, i had some underboob which did not look good. I feel like if you’re a girl with a big chest, this lingerie won’t fit you well. i’m really disappointed because it looked like a good product :(
3	Decided not to use the hanger because it would wear off the paint at the top of the door due to indentations in the metal that increase the effective thickness while giving the hanger strength. It would be helpful to advertise the effective thickness because exterior doors have tight clearances.
3	These socks look exactly how pictures which is awesome but the 8-11 women’s size is generous. I’d say they fit more of 6-9 comfortably. Kind of annoying.
3	This shirt was HUGE on me. I normally wear an xl, however lately when I order an xl it's too tight in the chest area. This time I ordered the xxl and it was SO huge I have to return it! It was cute at least!
3	Works. Bought on the recommendation from a YouTube channel I like. Only things not keen on are activation of emergency save button which is in the middle and the confusing menu navigation. Does its job though.
3	This was my first inverted umbrella and as such I treated it with kid gloves. (Be nice to the new shiny!) I so badly wanted to love this but it began falling apart (points where the inner material met the outer material tore apart) on my second use. On my third use one of the spines popped out of its pocket and while I could have fixed both of these issues for me the experience and novelty had been ruined.
3	Was really snug. Pushing the power button is hard for some reason. We tried putting it on again and it's still hard. Can't take a screen shot anymore cuz the button won't let u push it. Soon as u take case off, they work fine.
3	My item arrived today and half the bottle was empty. It had leaked into the packaging. I looked for the sellers email/contact info to contact directly but was unable to locate any even with their 90 day satisfaction guarantee.
3	I honestly think that the quality of these should be better for a Puma product. The thread pulls a lot. Will not buy again.
3	Already the legs are getting gritty feeling and only used 5 times. Hope it lasts better than the gen 1 and 2.
3	The 2 original mayo were fine. The Chipotle Lime was a liquid oily consistency. I contacted Amazon and they made a refund. Amazon was great, the product wasn't so great.
3	Help but not enough, baby chair leaves mark on leather seats
3	Had to cut to size and it’s see through, not the same quality that the machines came with at all.
3	Though the ease and simplicity of the fire Roku wish it would not keep freezing up on me ended up going to a Amazon Fire stick sorry guys
3	It's beautiful but turned green in two weeks and I didn't shower with it.
3	Decent ball. Average went from 190 to 205 in a few weeks. Hits hard. Leaves a lot of 10 pins on soft hits.
3	I've been using this printer for nearly two months. This is my first 3d printer, so I can't compare it to others of the same type. Here is what I have found. The packaging and shipping were excellent, and the customer service has been fantastic. The package shipped with everything that was required to set up the printer. If that's all I was reviewing, this product would have five stars. That being said, since I have set up the printer, which took around 8 hours in total from unwrapping to starting my first print, I have had multiple parts failures. The z-stop sensor was bad out of the box. I contacted the seller and they paid me back for the new one I had to purchase. The temperature sensor for the hot end died within the first month and had to be replaced. Now at the end of the second month both of the board cooling fans have failed, resulting in heat damage to the board and the loss of my heated bed power supply, as well as the connector for the x axis motor. Again, the seller was quick to respond and is sending a new control board. The only complaint that I have is about the quality of the parts that were shipped with the product.
3	OK-have to get used to wearing them- sound is good- well worth the money
3	wish it would have fit...they are so pretty
3	Good wide belt. Imported and will stretch quickly. I had to keep adding holes and trimming the end off to use.
3	These are not stick free like they say they are
3	So far I have only used this once but it will come In handy as the weather get worse here and we have to be outside for soccer games. It is deep enough for a chair or two and the windows on the side make it Possible to still see the game While sitting far back inside it.
3	Came in good time but cannot help my condition. Will see in time.
3	The vest runs small.
3	Did not hold up as well as other cases I have had. Kept my phone safe but the screen protector came loose and had many issues after that.
3	This item for works about 1/2 the time and then I put it away and try Blu Emu
3	The shoes are very cute, but they cut into the back of my heel.
3	Very complicated and directions are very poor, and typed very small. Unit was returned.
3	Shipment arrived very quickly. I have absolutely no problem with the seller. I haven't noticed any change or improvement since using the product, which I found to be rather pricey. Still using it though.
3	This.... It was just too fluffy and fantastical that I feel the only reason why cancer is mentioned is to differentiate it from other very similar novels and that just felt wrong.
3	I didn’t receive the blue or mint colors (which were the main colors I wanted). Got cream, taupe & peach.
3	Little too quiet to hear above 45mph.
3	I purchased the 2XL - I normally wear a L/XL in tops, but have a large bust, and wanted a loose fit. This was the weirdest fitting active wear top I've ever purchased! The upper arms were absolutely huge. The chest fit fine. The stomach area was skin tight (and this was supposed to be 1-2 sizes too big!). I'm going to try the men's version, as I really want some cheap long sleeve quick dry UPF tops for hiking and camping!
3	Pretty basic information and difficult to function with the book and actually trying to do a session. Save yourself the frustration . Watch a video
3	When I pull the yarn through, it gets stuck on the light. The light should be moved back on the hook about a half inch. Nice concept; just didn't work for me.
3	smaller than I anticipated. but very cute.
3	They appear do be working as advertised .
3	Already chipped only had it for 2 months but for the price it’s decent.
3	This is definitely one of those "love it or hate it films." Those who like it, Really like it and those who hate it Really hate it. I enjoyed the film and the story plot. I can't say that at any point of the film I was scared but it was enjoyed none the less.
3	The cable had a cut in it. Quality seems to be durable.
3	I love the design but have used the product for less then a week and my phone has already cracked. It is great comfort in hand but is not the best when dropped
3	Color was just as the picture but it did come in too short. I would definitely say ordering a size up or 2.
3	Not a great product, but ok to use. Maybe my expectations were too high.
3	cheap plastic spigot had to be replaced with a metal spigot; still resulted in inconsistent flow. Sometimes slowing from a tiny stream to a trickle. The metal spigot provided a satisfactory flow but will sometime slow to a tiny stream
3	Works well. Slides just a little
3	Like it would of given 5 but take doesn't dim. Also only ordered 1 they sent 3 and billed for 3. Easy return though. But now only had four maybe a month and it's starting ti flash on me. Won't buy another.
3	I wear a medium, ordered a large -should have ordered an XL. Also its a little itchy kinda like when you touch burlap.
3	i would like to exchange for a different size
3	The legs are really long. The fabric has a lot of shine and looks a bit cheap, but my little one loves them.
3	Material sheds everywhere. Perhaps I should have washed it first.
3	The photo makes it look just like the advertised color but it’s not actually. It’s more of a Kelly Green. I don’t like the color and it doesn’t blend at all with my teal office things but on the plus side, it is super easy to slip on my computer, it has rings on the side Incase I wanted to add a shoulder strap . I just have to get used to this green.
3	I bought 5 boxes of these and did NOT end up using these clear balloons. I only used the strings. The lights weighed the balloons down too much and they wouldnt rise with the helium tanks we bought, (maybe it would work better if we had used party city's helium?) So we tied regular neon balloons to the light strings that came with this order and that worked out well. Each balloon string takes two batteries. I taped the battery packs to the floor boards of our walls. the balloons danced around and looked amazing!
3	Comfortable, but low quality material
3	This is my 4th Six Sisters Stuff cookbook and this one is easily my least favorite. The recipes seem so heavy - lots of frying, lots of high calorie/fat ingredients (cheese, pasta, cream). Actually, I love the dessert section in this book but probably for the same reason why I don't like the main dishes section (high caloric, high fat = yum!) My favorite of their cookbooks that I go back to lots is their "A Year With SSS".
3	So these are prettt great sunglasses but I’m giving it a 3 because if you have a low nose bridge or chubby cheeks, it’s not the greatest fit. But other than that you could rock these!
3	I wish you could personalize them. I bought these for a memorial for my dog to place on a remembrance project and it would have been great to have his name and birth and death dates.
3	Having problems with a slow leak. Have re-seated the filter twice but still seems to have a slow drip.
3	It's ok. Wish they carried the unflavored version in this pack, the vanilla is too sweet. Otherwise, it's fine. Good to have on hand since you don't have to refrigerate.
3	Touch I D does not work. Apple not allowing the feature to be activated. The screen looks good tho.
3	At first, I was very pleased. The robe is thick, comfortable and cozy. However, I've noticed that the material is getting thin in an area toward my chest plate and shoulders after about 3-4 months. I believe the detangler spray that I use in my hair is causing the fabric to loosen and thin out.
3	Super cute shoes that don’t look as inexpensive as they are! BUT listen to all of the reviews. THEY RUN SMALL. I am an 8 1/2, sometimes 9. I ordered a size 9 to be safe and they are way too small.
3	These sheets are described as being made from Egyptian cotton with a 500 thread count. I was hoping for luxurious nice soft sheets. These sheets are OK, I guess, but neither luxurious, nor nice and soft. The price should have been a tip-off. They also took quite a while to arrive, not the 2 day shipping I expected with my Prime membership.
3	They r cute but when u assemble them it’s hard to keep them straight! I had to use scotch tape at the bottom to secure it..
3	My order was sent to me with one empty container. There is a no return policy so, I could not return. Excellent product, terrible distribution.
3	Good got what I paid for
3	Without giving away the story, I didn't Henderson for some of the book. It was funny and romantic, but the other part, about being invisible I didn't get.
3	Suction cup comes loose a lot
3	Love the product but don't like the return policy. The 3 lb bag arrived half empty and sugar spilled all over the box because of a large hole in the bag. When I carried the box through the house and opened it in the living room which means sugar was all over the house. I'm kind of upset that I can't do anything about it because of the no return policy. The product itself is GREAT! I switched to Lakanto Monkfruit last year and it's the only sugar replacement I use. I would buy this again (hopefully without the damaged bag next time lol)
3	Fair. You get exactly what you pay for with this price point. Screen extremely hard to see in direct sunlight. Getting watch to light up when you lift your wrist is hit and miss. Tends to turn on when you don't want it to - like when your sleeping. Very bright in a dark room. Still haven't gotten the sleep data to work.
3	They forgot to send the "S" duck so I had to improvise.
3	Too much repetition and pointless conversations. Interesting journey and some interesting side characters. The differences between the 3 Musketeers are perhaps too subtle.
3	I have had this epilator for about 5 months and have used it approximately 10 times in total. This product is my first epilator so I can't compare too much to others. However, as many other reviewers here I have had the same issue where the first few times I used it the battery lasted a long time. Now, it will only epilate for a few minutes before I have to put it back on the charger. Unfortunately, you cannot use this epilator while it is plugged into the charger, so it is kind of frustrating that you can't just power through and get the epilating over with in one sitting. With that being said, it does a really good job of actually epilating. My leg hairs grow quickly, so I have to epilate once every 2 weeks. This has been an okay first epilator, but honestly if I could send this one back I would. I will probably buy one in the future that will work while it's plugged in so I don't have to wait in between charges to use it. If you are looking at purchasing this epilator, please look into other epilators that will actually work while charging. Don't make the same mistake I did!
3	Very nice shoe & comfy. Giving this a lower rating because one shoe is defective. There is nothing to hold the strap in place on the right shoe.
3	Love that these are easy to get on and off... and our pup adjusted to them quickly. Just a heads up: they'll need to be washed frequently since your pet's paws will sweat and cause a stinky feet odor. (At least that's what happened with us). Also, keep your pet's nails trimmed! Our booties only lasted about 45 days because his nails busted through the fabric part of the bootie....We already need a replacement pair; so for that reason (cost vs. ROI) I rate them 3 stars.
3	It’s ok. Nothing spectacular. Ordered 2 and only one worked.
3	The product it self is fine, well built and straight forward to install. However, I can't get inside deliveries because I have a security system.
3	It might be a fun game but it will take some practice to use the shooter. The ghosts move fast. I can't say it's a bad game because I don't play games that require total attention. I like to watch TV while I play. Solitaire and puzzles and games like Balloon Pop and bowling are the kind of games I play.
3	They're nice and silky but they definitely don't look like the picture or the same color even. They wear and tear very easily.
3	Works great, but made from cheap plastic, make sure you store it good and have it padded and disassembled, if not, you'll go back to get it to use it and it will be broken, that's why I had to order this one, I have only used it one time too and when I went to get it to use it the 2nd time, it's broken.
3	Quality good but was too tight
3	Fit way too loose, not usable. I'm 170lbs and 5'6", I got the large and it was too big. Very disappointed
3	As an overall product, this is nice. It is soft, has a nice color (we got the tan colored one), and serves its purpose as a cover to the duvet. However, the main annoyance is that it doesn’t have ties to attach to the duvet and keep it in place. I don’t know how durable this will be because the fabric is similar to sewing two sheets together; it’s pretty thin. But for now, I like it and will keep it.
3	The concept is good, but the gum flavor only last a few minutes.
3	It doesn’t have a protector for your screen. It’s chunky. I thought it would be shimmery and it was not it’s Matte pink. When dirty, hard to clean.
3	Large size is really small haven't tried it giving for a gift
3	Cute concept, but the cat inside the mug is seriously off-center. Quality control dropped the ball on this one.
3	I love this wig. It’s heavy and I like tht it mimics my natural curls but I have having leave-out cause the part is so tiny, I tried tweezing and making it wider but like it’s still short. It’s a nice wig for a hat or leave-out, but make sure you’re willing to pin the back up cause you’ll need a lot of leave out for this to look natural
3	Definitely not his best work. Grisham keeps you interested, even if the ending disappoints.
3	Great for the price. A little small for an 8-9 year old.
3	Not my style. Exaggerated pear body does not do well with full slips. Too large on top.
3	Great range easy to use - only down fall is one of the 2 is missing a antenna ( they come as a separate piece in each package and screw on to the base) it seems as though it was just forgotten in packaging. Very bummed.
3	OK in an emergency but does not feel very sturdy to me, and I'm average weight female. I wish I had gotten the more sturdy version. Also the legs can be really difficult to open. It does pack up small so is handy to have for a back up. Maybe with practice the legs get easier to unfold.
3	I am a big Essie fan, especially their gel line. However, this color goes on really thin in my opinion. At four coats, it still didn’t have the professional coverage that their other gel colors have. This has a lot of sparkle to it, which makes it go on a little less smooth. Not my fav.
3	I ordered brown but it is more of a dark purple. I do like the way if fit though
3	It not worth your energy. Not happy. Unqualified.
3	These are nice, but cheaply made. It is a thin wooden dowel rod with a small flag stapled to it (2 staples). Will be fortunate if it lasts the season in the heat, wind, and storms. Glad it is made in the US, but it is cheap China quality. Works for what I need, but if you need something that will last, you might want to look elsewhere!!! God Bless the USA
3	I agree with most of the reviewers here. Positives: the eyes look great, the case for them is nice. Negatives: the separate baggies for the backings, backings feel kind of cheap. I haven't tested them against the rigors of children playing, but I may not even try without gluing them given the problems other people have had. I'm giving three stars because these will work just fine for what I want them for (mostly cutesy gifts for grown-ups).
3	Because of that non messy coating those crayons don’t color much with my 2 year old baby’s coloring pressure. At least she enjoys stacking them up though.
3	Not impressed about the "rubber boot" covering the plug , but you get what you pay for .
3	Product came in damaged.
3	The deodorant smells good. I was hoping for it to be effective but just like any other natural deodorant doesn’t work. Especially in summer it works for 1-2 hours and then you need to really or your underarms will smell bad.
3	The sunrise simulation portion is good. I have to have mine set to Level 10 (highest level) in order for it actually wake me up. The alarm itself is only a buzzer. There is no option for other sounds. This is a good, basic sunrise alarm clock. If you want more variety, I'd recommend Phillips' more expensive version. I had that one prior to having to purchase this one when I moved overseas.
3	Love it but I have uneven heating
3	it's a white cream, so far so good needs more time to know for sure
3	Still leaking, maybe pump is not fixable.
3	Very cute (present for my 9 year-old as she gets ready for middle school). Unfortunately, however, there were only 2 instead of 3 bags included, but seller kindly apologized for this inconvenience and said they will send it immediately)
3	The flip flops are good, but my only complaint is they run a but small. I got my normal size and my heel is about 1/4 of an inch hanging off the back. They're very comfortable and their sole is thicker than expected.
3	The one and 9 lost its helium the same day it was inflated
3	My skin's sensitive, this moisturizer doesn't burn usually but it leaves a residue on my face and isn't as moisturizing as I'd like
3	Run small. I ordered up a half size, should have gone up a full size.
3	Got this sunglasses on the mail i like the way it looks but it came with the lenses barely fit in the frame. I had to fix it and put it back in place but still had the space and the lense didnt seem like its the right fit for the frame. 😫 supposed to be a christmas present but decided not to give it due to the lenses not fitting well in the frame.
3	Feels like I bought a knife kit more than a finished product. Handle is roughly shaped and poorly fit to the liners & bolster. Blades are sharp but sloppily ground. With some sandpaper, a wet stone and some WD40, this ought to make a descent knife. Just glad I looked before wrapping it up for Christmas.
3	Works fairly well at catching litter from feet. I find it difficult to clean. Finally tried hosing it off and that did not work very well plus it took a long time to dry.
3	Pretty case but the ends do not stay on very well. Would like it better if it were one piece. I lost the bottom piece within 2 weeks of using
3	Only gave a 3 because it's not as big as described. It's really soft which makes it's a great toy for my older child and my baby to play with
3	Very little support, but otherwise cute and fits well.
3	It does it's job as a phone wallet encasement, but not super great. My case was clearly made of cheap material so it started scratching a few weeks into using the phone. It does get easily scratched. It's been a few months (around 3), and at the corners, most of the gray has rubbed off. I really like the bezel which keeps my phone safe, and I haven't gotten a single scratch, though.
3	Not bad, until the end. How is it that the hero's daughter, after going through her own mother's death, and the subsequent trauma with her dad... but wait... it gets better... then, at the end of the book being kidnapped and witnessing two people murdered, along with having to save her dad from drowning after he'd been shot... doesn't show any signs of trauma. Yep. Pretty dramatic ending. But, it's all good because they're all going to run in a 10k.
3	This dress is inconsistent. The army green, wine, and grey ones I got deserve 4.5 stars. Their fabric is super soft, and they do not collect lint. They are a good length to wear over leggings, and I love the pockets!! The black one was marked large, but it ran a full size smaller. The material is also less soft. It doesn't even feel like the same dress. Also, it collects lint terribly! I do not recommend this dress in black for cat or dog owners.
3	Not almost charging as fast charge 3.0 and sometimes works
3	The lid itself is hard to screw on The bottle is quite wide itself to hold Coldest water I have ever had :)
3	Well made but sizing is smaller than sizing chart says.
3	It's light weight for sure.
3	The rod seems sturdy and high-quality but for whatever reason it falls down so easily! Whenever I pull slightly at the curtain, it just slips to one side.
3	On the plus side, it'll definitely protect your juul and pods and it's made pretty well. I like the magnets inside that snap the cover back on nicely. However, it's only designed for juul brand pods. If you buy any 3rd party pods made for Juul, they will not fit in either "extra pod" slot and if your juul has one inserted it will not fit in its slot either. I personally use the third party pods far more often (I think they taste better) so I was very disappointed. This will collect dust in my room. Also it's a lot bulkier in person and a little heavier than I'd like since I planned on keeping it on my pocket. (Probably better for someone who carries a purse/satchel)
3	Comfortable but warm to sleep on.
3	This case would be great and has potential. However, after a short time, the stand won’t stay firmly closed. It will start to hang out a bit and flap open/close. The first case did it, returned it, and now the second case is doing it. The stand is a heavy metal so if they would have added a small magnet to keep it closed it would work perfect. When open, it holds its position firmly in any position. Otherwise it would be a great case if ESR figures out a way to keep the stand closed.
3	When I bought this headset I was super excited because it had tons of great reviews and it seemed to be a really good headset and when it got here it worked really good for the first 10 minutes or so and then out of nowhere the Mic stopped working so I am still going to return and get another pair and hope that it was just a simple mistake.
3	Attractive and comfortable but we give this a low rating because the zipper came apart within a month of use. We like the rest of it, but thumbs down on the zipper.
3	The lids are not always secure and sometimes leak
3	Very nice looking clock but it is NOT silent!!! There is a quiet and noticeable sound to the second hand going around the clock. Our sound machine blocks out the noise so it works for me but if you were going to silent this is not the clock for you.
3	Buy at least a size down. Im an XL, hoping large actually fits. Sizing chart inaccurate...
3	Packaging label is old and faded and expires in less than a year. I thought the self life would be at least a year or two.
3	Pretty short but has high intensity vibrations
3	Also fell down overnight, like others’ reviews. Like: the WHOLE THING because it attaches to each other. Had to go buy double sided tape from Home Depot to get it back up but once we did it looks pretty cool. Still coming off but overall looks good. But know that you will also need double sided tape. They should fix the adhesive. These photos are AFTER adding double sided tape.
3	Only an authorized dealer will have access to software downloads to update the module to make this functional. I returned it and had a shop install a different brand.
3	Does not charge fast.
3	This didn't really work for me, I had great results with the Boric Acid Suppositories!
3	I'm still trying to get pass the first bottom level..I'll ask my granddaughter to help me.
3	Put some air them.plants on
3	I was expecting the charm to be slightly bigger, smaller than a quarter, needless to say it still looks buzz worthy.
3	Using it as body wash, but the scent is a little off from the perfume.
3	UPDATE - The company agreed to replace, even though I was out of time. I am glad because I really like everything else about the unit except that the DVD player failed. I paid for it to be installed, worked fine for 2 weeks. Now CD player jammed, no way to get a library CD out. It is, of course, 2 weeks after RETURN period expired. I will try anyway. I liked the unit because the buttons were easy to use and a friend told me that the chips etc were good quality. But I really need the CD player. I got a PUMPKIN last year for another car and it was fine. So I will replace this one.
3	The 2 tier dishrack is great for doing large loads of dishes. The drip tray fits nicely and floats about 1 inch off of the counter. The two cup racks are useful, however you need to be careful as cups can fall off of the upper level. My biggest issue is that the plastic separators for the plates are very cheap and flimsy. They started to snap after about 1 month.
3	Looks cool but smart watch tech isn't up to par with current technology
3	Quality seems ok. It’s too small lengthwise and might not fit long pencils.
3	Good design, works well
3	I'm only giving this a 3 star, its very pretty, but as far as protection, it doesn't feel very secure. I thought it had 2 covers, a hard inner layer and a soft out layer ,that is what the video looked liked..thank you.
3	A little small and was very light like a cheap tshirt
3	The charger port won’t stay closed
3	Nice just feels super cheap compared to other belts of the same type
3	I hate reviewing this product because my complaint has nothing to do with the product itself. When I received my box, apparently something very heavy had been dropped on top of it. In fact it actually cut through the cardboard box. The whole top layer of boxes were mashed and looked very unsightly. I do not intend to go to the trouble of packing them up and sending them back because of the way they look but I am very disappointed that this happened. Just wanted you to know in case you need to touch bases with the people who deliver for you.
3	The cord is WAY TOO SHORT!
3	I returned this, as I discovered that it didn't come with the actual fabric end, with the zippered door. I do have a shelter with a zippered door, and I do very much like the roll-up door kit that I have in that. Makes it much easier to roll up a door for shelter access.
3	My 2 year old used this like 3 times and got scared to go back on. Not a big fan is because there is no slot to hold a tie fit on the toilet. It move around and the plastic screw come off easily. Will look for other options.
3	Cute, but I did not realize the skin tone. Definitely dark tan skin.
3	Cold Pursuit is book 2 of the Cold Justice Series. I was a bit disappointed in book 2 of this series. The plot comes right out of the headlines but it didn't seem as good as book 1. Vivi is the mother of a son who doesn't speak. They are at a mall when a terrorist attack happens. She is helped to escape by Jed (an FBI agent) and he takes on the responsibility of their safety. The terrorists target the boy as they think he heard or saw something while hiding in a cupboard. There are lots of twists to keep the suspense going. I gave it only three stars as I didn't feel the romance. I do recommend the series.
3	Ty's story intrigues me more than the sneak peak they showed of Wade's last time. Not enough for me to pick it up or pay for it, but enough that I wouldn't curl my nose up If it gets offered for free. I still think the title of this one should have been nothing but trouble or the Mafia Princess. The right dress is a red herring because Nina doesn't dress sexy. She only wears one tight dress.
3	This is okay, but it arrived damaged and indented. It’s not worth it to try and return it so I still hung it, but it seems fragile. Wish there was a more straightforward way to be at least partially reimbursed, but that’s the risk of buying online!
3	ok, but have a problem trying to cut exactly & fit. Sure it would work for someone that is more knowledgeable
3	This book was chosen by my book club. It was OK, not outstanding.
3	Came without the removable shoulder strap
3	it arrived quickly and Ok. looks very nice and matches my existing all white set. Price was fair.
3	Weeds continue to come back, kills the tops only in my experience, would not buy again
3	I had this shipped to my son and it arrived in good condition. He said interpreting the instructions was a nightmare! He said it seemed like they were written backwards and in a whole different language. It took more time figuring out the instructions than actually assembling the pieces.
3	not sure it's accurate
3	Since I am in a stage where I am configuring a lot of RaspberryPi's, i got tired of unplugging cables from my pc and into my Pi and then back to my PC when i was done. I bought this device so all i had to do was plugin my Pi and press a button. I am not sure if there is a configuration problem with the RaspberryPi but the Keyboard/Mouse does not function. The video capability works perfectly though.
3	Bought as a gift. She loves it; however, it was difficult to pair and stay paired.
3	Strongly dislike the taste of this. I haven’t tried it on it’s own but I blend in a vitamix with protein, fruit, spinach, almond butter and you this powder flavor overtakes everything else. Don’t like it...I’ve tried other high quality greens powders that blend much better with my shakes.
3	These used to be great, but all the do now is break the hair instead of pulling it out.
3	Had to do some cutting and bending to get these to fit in my Stok grill. Once in they work fine.
3	The tube is half empty. You have to squeeze it all the way to middle before the ointment comes out. I feel I am being cheated but no choice I have to continue buying because my dog needs it for her eyes. Otherwise no go. My little chihuahua is used to this ointment for her dry eyes , so I do not want to change and her veterinarian is okey with this use.
3	Ryan's escapes are implausible. Would like a little more creativity. I mean, you know the hero is going to survive but Rayan is just a little too lucky.
3	It's not very comfortable, it's stuck in the butt.
3	The pic is deceiving. Keep in mind these are small, thin elastics. I use them for the end of braids (thicker braids, not small enough for cornrows or anything like that). But you DO get the quantity shown of 36 ea.
3	Re-stocking fee aside, I returned it because the motion timelapse functionality is pretty much useless. I wasn't expecting miracles but expected to be able to do some simple moves. But the resulting TL wobbles all over the place and the app that controls it is really bad... Cumbersome and you have to reprogram it every time (can't repeat moves). Otherwise the product seemed fairly solid in the sense that it worked fine when I tested it it just a handheld gimbal (with a gh5 and a couple different lenses). There's no indication on the product page (that I could find) that you'll be charged a re-stocking fee and this is the only time I can recall being charged one on Amazon - and it was on the order of 100 bucks. Pretty lame.....BUT... Amazon refunded it completely when I complained.
3	Can't feel the heat at all. Don't like the design or the way the rollers are very rough. Actually gave me bruises on my lower back.
3	It's a little too large for my Subaru Forester but it works. A bit difficult to get under both visors and has an usual smell.
3	The case was badly broken, but the disk was OK.
3	.... part, but the stand that was sent had only one.
3	It is cute but does fit on the small side.
3	The cable seems okay; however the USB-C is not flush with the computer -- not well-made
3	Lens seems fine. I was actually impressed when I first took it out. Color looked great. Smooth aperture and focus rings. Then I realized I can’t focus any further than about 8 ft. Others have said this is an issue with the adapter, which is probably the case. However I am able to focus very closely. I wonder if that’s because of the adapter as well. Either way I think I’ll keep it since it’s just 25 bucks and try other adapters
3	Some of the charging cords did not work properly, after a charge or two they would stop working all together. The chargers that did work were convenient length and charge was a average charging speed.
3	I ordered the extra large and the fit was like a regular large. After washing and NOT drying, the fit became like Small, which I was very sorry about, because it is well made, very nice, soft fabric, good support, but shrinks more than anything I’ve seen in years. I gave it three stars because the material and construction is nice and maybe a smaller person can order two sizes larger, wash it, and then have a very nice sleep bra that can even be worn casually during the day.
3	As others have noted, this is an oxidized, brown powder. It can be polished to shine if doing inlay by sanding up tp 600 grit. HOWEVER, the common technique of inlay - filling the void with powder then dripping CA glue (thin super glue, 2-3 cP) over top of the powder does NOT work with this material. The CA beads up and rolls off to the side. I tried to use Super Thin which is intended for this purpose. Guess I'm on to epoxy instead.
3	I kind of like these.... I brought them because I wanted to tackle mildew and smell issue of regular dish sponges. But with this one you have to use more soap and this it’s not very easy to hold when washing dishes. I would purchase silicone dish sponges again but not this kind. Maybe another one with skinny scrubbers. Maybe it would hold more soap that way...
3	a bit small for my hands....other wise OK
3	I was really excited to put these up. The sign was really nice and so where the photo booth picture sticks, The only thing I didn't like Where the latex balloons they didn't last long whatsoever. Some were even popping while we were blowing them up. Is they can fix this issue then it's a great product.
3	first one burnt up second one was delivered quick and has been working only been a few weeks PYLE stuff is cheaper had another stereo burn up too but just get the warranty with it in case something happens, been a month so far so good
3	The case fits well and feels durable, but for a guy, this case is too purple. I bought it thinking it was more bluish grey. I was wrong.
3	First of all, I would probably buy this card again. It is exactly what I wanted, albeit at a bit of a premium though not off par for the chipset. I have unfortunately had to interact with Gigabyte's support/RMA process all for a fan on the cooler block that has an internal defect causing it to make a grinding noise constantly. This started happening within days of receiving and installing the card. First, to get to the RMA, you have at minimum two accounts to create and tickets to submit, one for tech support, another for RMA. Then they will ask you to send in the entire card for what could be a fairly simple swap of a fan, rather than just sending the fan. They will also drop the ball on communication, so you will have to hound them for answers. At this point I expect to replace the fan on my own dime. In short, despite the fan issue, this card has been pretty reliable for being so easily OC-able and I would probably choose this model over what else is available out there right now, unless I planned on setting up a custom water cooling setup. Dealing with the inferior fan quality control issue, including interaction with technical support, RMA dept., and customer service, has been far less than ideal.
3	Just regular markers I guess
3	Good glasses. Lens kept popping out so I had to glue it in.
3	I had ordered this magnifying glass several months ago from Amazon. It was very stylish - shiny black plastic, decent light, good magnification, dark satin-like pouch. But I misplaced the glass, so I ordered the exact same one by just clicking "Buy it again" on Amazon. Imagine my surprise when I received an ugly, non-shiny BROWN plastic glass this time! It's not a big deal because it still provides the magnification I need, but it sure isn't as nice looking as the first one. It looks very cheap now.
3	Recipes may work for some but too many were packed with heavy cream and cheese. As this is not the way my family eats I returned.
3	Not as cute or as big as I thought it would be.
3	Earrings are fine, a little flimsy but for the price they are great
3	I would have liked to have been able to include a greeting.
3	Top will not stay on.
3	can't play wav files for some reason. menus and scrubbing don't feel good at all. playback makes weird decisions for you, like playing all tracks by he same artist for no apparent reason. has a photo viewing mode for completely no reason. bass boost completely annihilates music fidelity. just a really underwhelming product, but it delivers on it's core promise of playing mp3s
3	It wasn't unlocked, otherwise, great phone.
3	Distance between two layers is too short. Most of the shampoo and shower jew won't fit. But it's stable and looks great.
3	Make sure you order a wiring harness so you do not splice into your car's wiring. I installed this in a 04 Hyundai Elantra and fits nicely with the radio kit I had. Bluetooth connects perfectly and remembers my phone each time I turn the car back on. My only complaint so far is the screen is very dim and I can not see it. Does not really matter since only bought this for the Bluetooth. I did try the FM radio and that worked as it should. This is not a high power radio and would be subpar if you want great sound.
3	One channel was dead on arrival, did not work at all. Returned for full refund, decided to upgrade to the 90W which is great and not a great deal more
3	These are okay for what they are. We washed ours and the color lightened significantly! They fray very easily as well. I’d probably still buy them again though because my children like to play with them and they are cheaper than silk.
3	amazon shows it was delivered but I never received it.
3	Nice watch. Looks good. But doesn't keep good time. Everytime i wear it i have to set the time.
3	Disappointed with the color. Picture is aqua, but it’s blue. Nice mat tho!
3	Decent curtains but not blackout by any means.
3	I believe that reviews that talk about crushed shipping boxes, etc., are unwarranted because they are not about the product itself, however, I fully believe that the cost of the item is a huge part of the product and worthy of review. These are small plastic bags for doggie doo collection. I needed small plastic bags for another purpose and ordered some Amazon branded ones that are great bags, but they are a few inches taller and a little wider than these which was larger than I needed. The Amazon bags were about the same price as these but I got 900 of them. Here you get 200 bags that are a couple of inches smaller. These really work for what I need them for but I will need a new box every three months or so and just can't justify paying this price when I can get 900 of the Amazon bags, cut a few inches off the top and make do with those.
3	I kept reading because I thought something surprising was going to happen. The family connections that we learned about never really wowed me. It was an interesting story-but not so compelling.
3	It is hard to determine the correct color one bottle was what I expected the other darker, it is still good polish and I would buy again
3	Unfortunately as advertised this product was supposed to have 10 different colors it doubled up on a few of the colors and then the "white" was actually a clear filament. While they still work and I like that they do not smell or become bubbly when working with them, it is a little upsetting to not get what was advertised.
3	When I received this hitch pin it wouldn't work. I thought I was going to send it back but after looking at it real close I saw a spring had popped out of the little hole in one of the wings. Using needle nose plyers I was able to get the end of the spring back into its little hole. It is working just as it should now but I will be carful when I use it on my tractor and lawn sweeper.
3	My daughter saved up to buy this book brand new, when we received it there was a small dent in the top side, and white marks in the cover. Overall, it doesn't effect the book too much, but I would have liked a more accurate description of the condition of the book.
3	Nice lights for the price but case to put batteries in is very difficult to open. Had to get my husband to get it open.
3	I haven't worn mascara regularly for quite awhile til now. I love it... until my eyes get wet from tears, sweat or whatever. Will likely finish this container, but will look for another natural product when time to replace it.
3	The first half of this book is interesting and entertaing, but it was laborious to finish. It is as if the author had said what he wanted but kept writing. The topic is intriguing and very important, but this is not the vehicle i would want to send a message.
3	I really wanted to love these, but I don't. I've had two pair of Altras in the past and loved them. These seem a little cheap compared to the others. Worst of all, they've rubbed a blister on one foot arch. I was hoping after breaking them in it would stop but after 3 weeks, still blisters!
3	This pretty little wallet is too small to hold most cards and paper bills. I will have to put it in the Goodwill bag. Disappointing.
3	Not a lot of ink on pads
3	Received, waiting for the NE winter to but through the test!
3	3.5 STARS I enjoyed most of this book and look forward to the rest of the story in the next book. I love how Kennedy Ryan does her research and always highlights issues. I just got a little bored toward the end. Maybe it’s something about it being a duet and filling up space. I’m looking forward to the sequel.
3	They don't have any cushion on the ends of the headband, and a couple of jewels were displaced in the packaging. The jewels are easy to put back, but I'll have to find something to cushion the ends of the headband. They are ADORABLE though.
3	Its a great outfit i really like it but i never got my whip which im a little upset about cause i paid all that money for the hole outfit and never got the whip. other wise tho the outfit was great i love it
3	Fine, but certainly nothing special. Does the job to teach my son about the calendar and how to track dates.
3	This pitcher looks good...but the problem is the you can not remove the reservoir for cleaning purposes and also it has only a sticker to use when you have to change the filter...in not like the other ones that the red light let you know when u need to change it.... I didnt use yet..i asked for a refund they told me is not refundable but they did an exception and they refunded me the money..the only thing is they told me that i dont have to return the pitcher...they told me to use it...dispose it...or donate.
3	The colors shown don’t match the written description. We ordered what was written and received what was pictured. We weren’t worried about the color but if you are make sure you clarify what you are getting. The cooler itself is great.
3	I was hoping I'd like these because I heard they are good for you.... but I did not like them at all. To sweet and bitter at the same time.
3	Video low quality. Great sound. Video comes and goes into focus. The show itself is fantastic. Shipping was awesome.
3	Great materials. It feel secure and the quick release works just fine. I wasn't expecting to have a handle bar so that is a plus among this price range
3	Very nice look, good color and quality. Customer service is good too.
3	The dress is a little big in size so order a size down. I went ahead and got a petticoat based on other reviews and it fluffed it up really well! The disappointing part is mine is missing the bow. I need to get something to tighten the waist anyways but this costume ends up being a little pricey with all the extra items you have to purchase.
3	Seems like the black anodizing starts to corrode after some time at the matting surface of the whip. i only use the nmo ring and use the stainless antennas in its place.
3	they do what they are supposed to, but I really only needed one
3	I like unicorn beetle, but it had no built in screen protector like they usually come with.
3	Not amazing, a little unsturdy and drawer does not open well, but good for the money
3	I had hoped the colored sleeves would work like a locking bit holder or the button on the back of a ratchet to lock the sockets in place. Not so; the ball in the side of the square drive is properly spring-loaded, but the sockets just pull off as with any less expensive socket adaptors. More important is that they do not properly fit and lock into my impact drivers. I must, therefore, hold the adapter in place for use.
3	Was really excited about product to clean the oven top and bathroom but did not hit expectation. Battery life 10-15 min on a charge torque limited to dig in.
3	Looked nice, but didn't fit the phone. we bought the wrong one.
3	It doesn't really work. Not good as expected. Won't do the trick.
3	Because of how the tubing is wrapped for shipping it has been very difficult to change it form flat to round so that it can drain as advertised.
3	Works fine. Easier than spring collars but can move just a little.
3	The provided screws DO NOT work to secure the M.2 drive onto the adapter. This is SUPER frustrating because now I have to wait to get some.
3	I didn’t notice anything
3	The color of this backpack was WAY darker than the photo. It's more like a dark, electric blue.
3	Ame with broken snaps.
3	If they work they’re great but if not, your stuff just keeps falling everywhere.
3	Small strip and colors somewhat off what is on the container. Pads close together, can bleed into one another if you are not careful. I am getting used to them and hopefully my accuracy with them will improve over time.
3	Lightweight and compact able with good grip and quality.
3	good swimming goggle.. easy to use..the box says it come with a protective bag to store the goggles but I didnt get one
3	very thin construction, not sure they will hold up
3	I loved the convenience of getting at my door step. Used it for pre and post workouts. I first used Alanine in capsules. Be careful NOT to consume greater than recommended dosages, there are side affects. Dizziness and tingling were mine. Once I corrected my dosages, it worked great.
3	I enjoyed this history, even though I suspect it skated close to fiction at times. There was a little too much authorial opinion colouring the text.
3	I wasn't sure why it made a difference having the leash attach in the front, I still don't know why it works, but it DOES. My dog, a 60 lb golden retriever, was a terrible puller- really she's just all around terrible on a leash. I'm positive this is our fault, lack of training, but this harness was really helping. Then the D-ring in the front where you attach the leash tore off:( Other than that, the harness is very well built. We have tried reattaching it a few times, but it comes off each time. Hopefully the manufacturer fixes this defect.
3	This is a bad designed heater. It’s too heavy so be mindful that it can fall over easily. It can with a screw that supposed to connect the post and heat together but it didn’t fit. So I got a heater that’s not secure.
3	difficult to put on, not at all comfortable
3	I was very excited when I received this product. It was what I expected but I was greatly surprised how much I could fit in the bag. I was using it for my children’s clothes on a flight to Florida on spirit airlines so it was the perfect size. My only complaint is that after one use the seams are ripping on 2 out of 3 bags we used, And that there is no longer handle on the bag.
3	Was looking for earphones that had cordless MP3 as other earbuds had worse reviews. Looking for use in walking more than swimming. Had no trouble loading music from PC.The sound quality is just average with the smallest earpieces which usually work for me. Bluetooth connects well, but sometimes transmission is not clear. Will continue to try to incorporate in my day... Not happy about the proprietary charger/music connection cord. I have already misplaced it several times and would like to get another charger to have on hand.
3	I have yet to find one that does a thorough and painless job.
3	The melodica plays easily, all except for the high G key - for some reason the sound is much more delayed than the other keys and I have to blow more air for the note to come out. Disappointed there as I'm not sure what's causing that issue.
3	Another okay book. Fairly decent, better than some other cozy mysteries I have read, but nothing special
3	This mascara is not any better than most drug store mascaras. A bit clumpy in my opinion.
3	Super cute but this piece was made for a short girl lol it fitted to tight on my middle area .... i have a long torso
3	For the money, you can’t beat it. I left off a star for two reasons the drain hoses included are terrible, they kink at the slightest bend. The second reason is because I spent an hour with goo-gone trying to remove all the shipping pads.
3	Nice looking bowls but they ended up being smaller than I expected, like the most I could for in here is probably like bowl of quinoa
3	Nothing yet maybe it’s a pocket gopher
3	It looks pretty, but came broken. I’m returning it and I don’t know if I’m ordering one more.
3	I purchased this set of sheets for my father to use as they were fleece. When I received them, I opened the package and washed them. After drying I folded them and found a thread run on the pillow case. Who would have thought. I have never seen this and I have purchased a lot of sheet sets over the years. Anyway, I tried contacting the seller and heard nothing. I went to return them through Amazon and when I got to where you print the return label, in fine print it says they seller will not take the product back if it has been washed. Amazon contacted me once by email asking about my return and I emailed back that I had not heard from the seller. So now I have not heard from the seller nor Amazon. I don't want my money back but it would be nice if I could get a pillow case. So from now on I guess I have to inspect the sheets before I wash them!
3	Love all my anker products and I really wanted to like these but just couldn't get passed the touch controls. Often when I went to adjust or remove the headphones I would accidentally swipe the controls and annoyingly change the song or volume or pause.
3	What ALWAYS gets me is the ads I see while playing other games, where you have to pick the correct object or tool, but when I download, it's always the same format....match 3 in a row, collect coins, buy stuff. I agree also with the comments that to continue on is expensive, 500 coins.
3	I was another customer that purchased the Daisy and recieved a Minnie. No big deal right? I was quickly sent a replacement and the product again showed up as a Minnie on my door step. I can see how this can be confusing for the warehouse because the product is from the "Minnie" line of toys. The wrong product label is being placed on the Minnie's. I have now ordered my third. Fingers crossed it's a Daisy!!! Customer care is quick to find a resolution but this has been frustrating.
3	It did not support the NFC capability of my phone.
3	Great case. Update jan 2018. Case feels sturdy and durable however phone was dropped maybe a from a foot height on tile and my screen protector broke. Lucky i had installed it.
3	The lamp was easy to assemble, even without directions. The shade came with it, but thre is no way to attach it to the lamp.😕😕😕
3	It looks nice and charged my iPhone XS Max and iWatch 4 and I liked that it was one cord in. But it was sometimes difficult to get the iPhone on the plug especially if it’s dark and you want to put your phone on the charger. I am returning it
3	I bought this in March and had opportunity to use it for the first time recently. I loved everything about it except one of the lids is wrong. It had the whole for the serving spoon on the opposite side. So I think you have me 2 right side lids. Wish you'd check the product before shipping. Any way you can send me the correct missing lid?
3	I like this product for the most part but the chain on the sun part down catch on my hair which tugs some. But ya get what ya pay for. Probably will replace the chain at some point
3	Not as fast as plastic sleds
3	I received my order about a week ago, but it was two Prayer Plants rather than the Nerve Plants I ordered. Amazon immediately sent out two more and they arrived today, but again, it was two more Prayer Plants. Amazon told me today that, as there was clearly a problem with their inventory, to order from the other seller on Amazon, so today, I'm trying for the third time, this time with JMBamboo. I'll re-visit this review when that order arrives but, for now, I thought I'd warn buyers to be sure and not buy this particular item directly from Amazon until they've had time to straighten out the problem with their inventory.
3	Nice, but the quality is okay but the price was the bested.
3	It’s good to keep the milk cool but not tall enough for 8 oz bottle.
3	This along with screen protector is what I wanted . This case lines up on the edge of screen protector and lifts it up allowing air to get under screen protector.
3	handles break very easy
3	Just did not hold my interest the way many books do. Since this was a free book, it was worth what I paid for it.
3	All plastic, not sure how long it will last, but will give it a go!!
3	product good, paid to much for 2 day delivery special, when it took 4 days to get here
3	It lasted for a few weeks. My gog popped it on second week.
3	The bands are somewhat flimsy, but they stay in place well and they feel nice. Can't ask for much more than that from underwear
3	Its strong but the red in the shaft slides out when changing attachments, does not affect the integrity of the equipment but it's annoying
3	I was a little disappointed with this one. A little tight. And by the picture it looked like a pleat over the polka dots. And it wasn't. Put the slip under it, and it looks great, other than shorter than it should be, and I'm only 5ft 1in. Next time I'd like to have my dancing dresses longer.
3	I actually thought it was a pack of two--too pricey for one luggage tag. well made and sturdy though
3	While it is extremely comfortable, I am able to get a strong erection while I wear this. This cage would be better for people who are more well trained.
3	Has good suction for a woman but if you have tough skin its not the best
3	Its not as good as other soaps in a foam cannon. It takes more that 2oz of soap.
3	material was see through
3	Works good for your wrist but not that comfortable to wear for a Long period of time
3	Ordered a set of four 6-inch bowls. One of the bowls in the package was broken. The other three seem to be okay.
3	This is more the first part of a book, establishing characters and motivations but lacking real substance. Clean prose (no major spelling or grammar errors) and well written dialogue. Depressing, since it only establishes the main character’s situation. It’s not bad, it’s just not good. I will not be following this series. I prefer my novels to contain a full story. Even a novella should have more story than this did.
3	the tape is hard to remove. But once installed it sticks really well to the shoe. I was looking for inserts that could be removed. Then again those will not slip out of your shoe. They are comfortable. I use them for one foot .
3	My kids are really into these right now but I find them super annoying. The joints become separated if you even move them slightly making them less than fun to play with. They also aren't easy to put back together - this should be opposite hard to fall apart and easy to put together - if it were a quality toy.
3	For the price I'm sure there are better. It seems fairly sturdy and was easy to put together however the cuts on some of the pieces were off leaving edges crooked or with gaps.
3	Not as spicy to me, but the flavor is good. Some of the ramen packs arrived broken, which is the only reason I’m giving it three stars. These are cheaper at Walmart if you don’t want to buy the entire pack.
3	The stupid game doesn't work on kindle fire and I wish it did
3	I suppose this is true of all brushes used for blending--needs too much ink. It does eliminate the stark outline of the blender, though. I thought of buying the more expensive sets, but I'm glad I didn't. This set gave me an idea of what the blending brushes are like at a lower price. I think I'm going to try some of my old make-up brushes.. .
3	It didn't last long, once it tore open it was very messy and the squeaker didn't work very well. My 55 Pit mix loved it, I just wish it would have lasted longer. Good size and I liked the rope inside.
3	I bought this gate to put on the bottom of the steps to our deck. It was more to prevent my toddler from going up the stairs. It works great for that reason. However I would NOT recommend using this gate at the top of the stair with a child. The mesh is flimsy and does not provide a solid and secure gate.
3	Too much relationship chatter for me. The old Anita would never have been so public about her kissing either. Not enough action.
3	I don't believe the readings were accurate.
3	When do you say an MMA fighter you think aggressive outgoing and it started off real strong and then he turned into a wimp it was okay I haven't really read this all there before but I'm willing to give it another go good points to the story interesting I just don't think you should have made him such a wimp
3	They don't feel like they will last for years.....they are however, better then trying to get my 4 foot 11 inch self in my baby without them
3	Bought a set for mom. Comfortable at a good price. However if you have kitties of the longhair variety that enjoys sleeping with you, these sheets are a magnet for their furs.
3	Item is very cute and sexy it just runs small
3	It was all good up until I dyed it brown. From that point the hair went down hill
3	My miniature schnauzer destroyed this in two play sessions. She loved the fact that it would dispense treats, she just had her own plan on how to get the treats faster. If you pet is less destructive, maybe this is a good choice. If you pet likes to chew and is a bit mischievous, try another option.
3	I like that it makes the non sharp edges but its really loud and sometimes takes a couple times around for me to be able to open the can.
3	these glasses came in a nice little bundle, and they are pretty good quality too! But these are way too big for my face, id say these are better suited for mens faces as they are larger and would be more proportional but if youre into the oversized look go for it!
3	nice product, not a huge fan of the orange color. also, I don't like the container it's in.
3	I really like the pattern. It's not really like a rug but more like a blanket with a nonskid backing. I was looking for something more rug like.
3	I purchased these thinking they would be a lot smaller. For a child. As in your questions, you stated it could fit a child to an adult. No way will my 4 year old grand daughter get these on her little fingers.
3	It’s a garlic smasher , it’s a ok tool ,deffinately not mush to have . Quality is so so , top came off after first use on the upper part , I needed to glue it back together .
3	I thought the gold was glitter but it is all matte.
3	The product itself is great as well as the shape of the container. The problem is that when I opened the envelope it had been shipped in, there was kale powder all over the place. The soft envelope allowed the container to be compressed in shipping breaking the seal. The product needs to be shipped in a box instead. I’ll buy again if they make this change.
3	Looks cheap. Braids not long enough.
3	Never received the book!
3	Balsa is weak but this stuff is low quality balsa...
3	The clip mechanism is a little stiff and doesn't open very much. If your glasses are wire-frames, this won't be an issue, but if they're a bit thicker, you'll need two hands to put them on or take them off. This is something I wish I'd realized, especially since they don't flip up. The photos showed them clipped onto plastic frames, so I guess I thought this wouldn't be an issue, but it basically means that if the weather's partly cloudy, I can't really wear them while driving unless I'm stopping a lot. Still though, the tint is nice, not too dark, and more toward yellow which handles bright sunlight without diminishing vision. If you have wire frames or super thin plastic frames, I highly recommend these, but if they're a little thicker, I'd suggest going with ones that flip.
3	Love these belts. Disappointed that he amazon version didn’t come in the decorative leather box.
3	I picked this up specifically for the usb-c connectivity to use with a new MacBook Pro. Unfortunately, plugged in the usb-c cord, hooked up a few simple things and got a whole bunch of nothing. Thankfully, it also came with a usb-a cord so I swapped out and that seems to be working out for now, but it's now clogging up a usb-a output on the hyperdrive.. 3 stars because it's functional with the usb-a cord, but definitely not working as advertised.
3	The stand magnet came off. The stand kept in the open position. I had to superglue the magnet myself. Clipping the phone into the hip holster can be challenging at times. This isn’t my favorite case but the moment it will work.
3	Can confirm that this works with docking station power cord for Dell and does transmit power and data, including monitor. It would be nice if it inserted a bit more, but the connection is solid. Good enough. Much better than the design by Dell (rigid cable sticking straight left of computer).
3	I love this band but the canvas has now separated and it look bad now -- for the price I would have expected it to last a lot longer. I wear my watch every day but do not really abuse the band at all -- not sure why the canvas has holes in it now.
3	Product is as described. Only OXO product that I have purchased that had less that great quality. Just not impressed
3	Ordered pink, but the color I received is Lavender. Kept anyway....would have preferred the color I ordered. Also the texture is very rough and shows through shirts...definitely not a t-shirt bra unless you don't mind lumpy looking breasts.
3	Just got it. Seems decent quality and will do what I need. Only issue at the moment is I ordered the blue color and they sent me beige. About to go on a big trip don’t really have the time to switch out.
3	Cheap material too short at the back to large at the front
3	Nice for the price could have better instructions. One connection broke when putting it together but was easy to fix
3	I loved this coverlet on my bed. I laundered it per manufacturer’s recommendation and the navy stripes bled into the white leaving the navy stripes faded and the white tinted a dingy blue color. As disappointing as this was, I was very pleased with the customer service from Great Bay Home. They immediately responded to my email and offered a replacement or refund through Amazon. I opted for the refund, which came immediately after I posted the return. It’s a lovely coverlet - if only it hadn’t changed colors on me.
3	It doesn’t work with iPhone cases (I have a thinner one, not an Otter Box or anything). So far, it seems sturdy but I’ve had it for a week. Pretty pricey compared to others. It’s heavy metal but the cord wiggles (maybe that’s a good thing if it doesn’t break and makes it easier to mount your phone... only time will tell) and without the ability to adjust the cable depth for cases I’m dissapointed.
3	Thin cheap wood just not worth the price. If I did it over again I would go with something metal.
3	Scratchy with a weird smell even after multiple washes.
3	The idea is awesome but for some reason the remote keeps reseting itself every 3 or 4 weeks. Then I have to go thru a quick config process.
3	Nice marbles but, there is not a good color selection. No reds at all. 😟
3	It’s a great battery pack, sadly just not that well built. I took it out of the box and fully charged it to test before packing it for our trip. I kid you not my 2yr old grabbed it off the table and dropped it, and one of the charge ports got knocked into the battery pack. Literally same day I got it. So returning it and getting a more durable pack.
3	Gave this 3 stars because there are no pictures of the recipes. I need pictures. regretfully, I had to return it.
3	It's a nice bag for phones, keys, and a wallet. Not really big enough for more than 1 water bottle. also, it doesn't sit up as high on the handle bars as it does on the picture. It actually kind of slumps down to were the top of the basket is facing outward .
3	Would have been helpful to know I wasn’t ordering a pair.
3	Cheap set, but they are what you would expect. Using them on a race car so they will work
3	I looked up reviews for this online, and most of them said to take off the plastic piece on the front and use a tempered glass screen protector. I didn't do this, and because I had to hit my screen so hard to make it work, I put a hairline fracture in a brand new phone. If you get this case, take out the plastic piece in the front and get a tempered glass screen protector. Nobody wants to fix my phone under any kind of warranty, as this is considered cosmetic damage now.
3	It is smaller than expected
3	This was my first review of this item: I will never order from this vendor again. When we pulled the wire ends off the switch the whole tab came out, it did this for everyone I tried to pull wire end out and it broke the switch when I tried to put it back in. Junk. Do no order this product you will not be happy. I was ready for install and now out of return window so I am not very happy. I hooked up with my local automotive wiring shop and he told me the problem. It seems on the wire ends you have to squeeze the tab on the wire end and force it out of the lock then the wire ends comes off easy. Its a shame, since I did ruin two switches and pulled the ends out of three others. I would now order this item again with the knowledge of how to use it. It seems the seller would have told us this in the literature/instructions. I am adjusting my rating to 3. Write better instructions it hurts your product!!
3	I loved this when I first bought it in Dec 2017. I put it away for a while and when I went to use it, it wasn't working. I assumed it was the batteries, but no. Despite replacing the batteries, there is still no response when I push the button to clear the screen. And I'm guessing I'm past the warranty period. Ugh.
3	Never got to use it. The idea of working on my Harley went south quick, fast and furious
3	a bit flimsy... pretty sure you could just pull this open by hand. but good enough
3	I bought two of these because I’m hard on chargers and was hoping the metal would help. One of them came broken so that was a waste. But the one that does work is pretty great.
3	I didn't notice many difference using this...
3	Very heavy and I pray it lasts. With the few handles so it sometimes I feel it won't
3	It does not work real good when you're on the freeway
3	Returned to merchant because it came with no power adapter. Ordered by mistake.
3	It is a cup holder and it does look and do exactly as described- The problem is the part that slides in-between the seat keeps coming loose-and slipping. I used some putty glue to secure it and now it is better-but cannot be adjusted- Overall happy, but needs better design!
3	Very classy upgrade and makes the watch feel as expensive as it is but the finish is beginning to wear off the clasp, I suspect where my wrist hits my desk at the office all day. I could see past that if the thing wasn't so expensive but given the cost I had to deduct 2 stars. Works great otherwise
3	I loved it, but the sun and rain tore it up too soon.
3	This book is the same as the only other book I have read from this author....the makings of a really great book with interesting characters who get shafted in the telling of the story. It could have been so good. Instead its just meh.
3	A couple of them (Patina and Ruby) seem to be defective. They are runny and not color saturated / thick like the others in the set. The rest of them are utterly fantastic, used them on etched glass.
3	Serves the purpose but these do not seem to hold smell as well as another brand I've bought. Like the fun colors though!
3	It is very hard to install sans the hook is too short you need to squeeze the sides for form to be hauled properly
3	OK shelf. Came missing a few pieces, but I was able to make it work finding extra pieces from past things. Very basic.
3	Love the dots, wish there were more red dot in a sheet or a couple of sheets of red in pack. Thanks
3	pretty small - I got it for a 6 year old and i would think it better for a 3-4 year old. Target is small and thin and hard to attach to anything
3	This was a typical Lusty Texas story, nothing great, a cute MFM no major drama or suspense...a bit high priced for this story but if you enjoy the series.....
3	These are cool but they get cops attention. They look a little ghetto. They do work however. Not sure if they're technically legal
3	Works well, but takes up so much more space in locker. Ended up purchasing a wire one
3	For those of you who don't like cliffhangers you might want to wait until March 2020 to read these. Certainly I would have. Other than that, I enjoyed this, but would have preferred to wait for a complete story, rather than half the novel.
3	It's a functional low cost carb. There were some dents, nicks and slight machine/casting flaws but it worked. I mainly got it to have a tunable carb to practice on. It came with a fuel line, clamps, and gaskets all wrapped in bubble wrap inside a box. The spare gaskets and fuel line make this kit have extra value.
3	the rings that did work were fine . 3 did not work
3	The light itself was fantastic! The colors are bright and beautiful! The remote is a piece of crap! You literally have to be standing on top of the light for it to work. If you’re looking for a beautiful pool light with multi color function this is a great product! If you’re looking to use it for the remote control capabilities, I would pick another product!
3	This is my first bottle so im not 100% sure yet. I do have to admit i feel my hair is a little thicker. But im hoping i notice alot more on 2nd bottle. Yes i plan on buying another.
3	Super cute, but taking them off and trying to get it untangled is a joke. Even just pulling down to use the bathroom was very hard.
3	Doesn't get all the channels I had with the last antenna. But the ones it gets has a great picture. Like that it hides behind the TV.
3	Was too small for my pup, had to return.
3	It's just as it's advertised. It's a decent cork board with a wood frame. It's great for it's price. However, despite it being advertised as being able be used vertically, it only has key hole slots that allow it to be installed horizontally. So I'm just going to do it myself or put in my own hanging kit.
3	Had to buy it for school.
3	The nose pieces come off very easily and had to use other nose pieces but wearing the glasses are comfortable and work really good.
3	I got this in two colors, black and light blue. I absolutely LOVE the black one! Relatively good quality, fits well, super cute. The blue one however came with a bit of discoloration and some threads loose.
3	The size is too big. I measured my Chihuahua at a size small but it is too big and she needs a size xs. There’s no return label and I think I’m not even able to swap out sizes
3	Cant tighten it! So it swivels around. Hard to direct it.
3	I love the idea to save our world from all the plastic, but the sticker label that wrapped these bags is so sticky it didn’t come off. Not even after putting them through the dishwasher! My second set had the same issue.
3	Disliked the continues reference to her strange personality, did not fully explain why the villain wanted to punish Genevieve.
3	The books are well written and the storyline moves along at a good clip. The three books are very short and should have been one novel.
3	One side does not fit snug.
3	This pop-up is amazing and easy for one person. I gave it a three star because of two flaws: 1) for the price I think it should come with a rain fly and 2) you have to be extremely careful that the screen doesn’t touch the Velcro or it will tear/ruin it. -I think the screen should be made of a better material like a real tent
3	got these to try and make sewing a lot of patches onto a jacket easier. i have no idea how folks use these little fellas! they waggle around all over the place and, if anything, made the project substantially more difficult and time-consuming. however, i can see these being useful in making plushies in the future, so overall not a huge loss. it takes practice if you're only used to hand sewing with a regular needle, so keep that in mind!
3	Cute and right size but package was ripped open when I got it.. And one pair is missing it's tag, looks like it had been cut out.
3	I found the handle to be too large for my hand. I'm an average size woman but found the brush challenging to maneuver. I returned it and purchased a competitor's product that is easier and lighter to use.
3	DON'T go off the suggestions. I sized up and got a medium. I usually wear s-xs the medium is too big. It also doesn't seem like it will have a lot of life. One wash and it looks a little beat up... Cute fashion bra however.
3	So what’s the deal with these? Well.....they sound good ... not great ... but pretty clean. Light on the bass for those that love the thump. They’re slightly muffled on the highs. But most of all... they need to be pushed to enjoy the sound quality. And as they break in ... the louder volume isn’t required to appreciate them. It’s a nice headphone for the price. But I’ve heard better for this price range. But these aren’t a disappointment either. They do look pretty nice though. Hard to describe where I would place them.. certainly not among my favorites... but not in the reject pile either.
3	Very fun. Bigger players are bullies , though. Pay to win, for sure.
3	Wasn't satisfied at all.
3	Did the job. Came with screws to tighten it.
3	Pegs not uniform in size making it a pain to assemble. Just ok.
3	so so for product quality - my son uses it - he is 10
3	I love the cut, the fit, and the style of this tank. I was looking for something to wear to work out that would be looser on the body. This tank fits the bill. However, the fabric feels really cheap. Like it would not be breathable at all. Actually, it feels like the kind of polyester that would make me feel too hot. It's probably better as a regular wear polyester tank, but not so much for a workout tank.
3	Colors were good, but a lot of ink comes out from barely pressing the stamp. Left splotches of ink on the papers and after one night of bingo, most of the daubers were less than half full.... Not sure if thats normal or not, but I thought they would last a lot longer than just one or two nights.
3	The easiest way to spread it was to use a mesh strainer around the room. Be aware that it does create a fair amount of dust when shaken and will cause some irritation to your lungs and eyes. This worked well for ridding our house of fleas as it’s 75% carpeted. For a cheap option it wasn’t bad.
3	They serve their purpose, but are fairly cheap and flimsy. It shows 3 different colors on the picture, but I only received the tan color.
3	A little big for newborns. But good for one year old baby’s or more. Fabric is very soft.
3	I only gave this 3 starts because.........I bought 2 of these. One worked fine and I like being able to power the Fire Stick from the UBS port right off the TV. However, the second one did not work. Must have been a problem with it's power supply because it constantly turned on and off.
3	It’s cute but really hard to hold onto. It slips right out of my hands. I had to get a pop socket just to keep it from dropping constantly.
3	This is great for wedding I wish Amazon can give discount on things we buy
3	We wanted to try something beyond the traditional KY and this came highly recommended. But it's just okay. It's not a terrible lube per se, but nothing impressive either. And even with a towel it can go through and stain. We don't mind finishing it out, but we won't purchase it again.
3	Bags are fine. Be aware they do not come with twist ties or anything to close them.
3	Fair read ing could have been better. Wishy easy leading man. Barely could do ANything. Couldn't control switching from one story to the other
3	Claimed to fit Coralife RO system It does not. Too tall. Didn't need to change them until last week. That's when my aquarium maintenance guy showed me that it was impossible. Disappointing, now the return window is closed.
3	It worked but only lasted a month before it got torn.
3	They are little oversize cover's. Beside that excellent quality.
3	Does not fit 2003 Explorer. It shows that it does, but it does not.
3	It buy pretty good size but when we attached together it was lot of space between parts of the carpet
3	I haven’t used it yet but I ordered it in dark blue and it came gray. Disappointed.
3	The lavender in this pack smells great but the rest of the flowers don't have much of a smell. I know that the company does not add scent which is good but I think it is good to know not to expect them to be very fragrant.
3	They are, for the most part good solid cables but they charge relatively slow.
3	Leaks, wish the magnetic cover had rubber gasket around it, it's ok to use for commute in a car but at that point might as well use a paper cup with a cover.
3	I am about a 33" waist and bought the medium size, and they fit really well. I find them very comfortable and they look good. One of the seven has already started to develop a small hole around a seam, after only wearing them for a day. The others haven't shown any such weakness yet but having one go downhill so fast doesn't give me hope for the rest. What's the point of a very reasonable price if they don't last more than a couple of uses? I've never had this kind of fabric before but it's very comfortable, so at least I know that for the future.
3	This shirt is not a marvel shirt
3	Runs large to fit over clothes, thin fragile material but waterproof so a good value. Do not put in washer!
3	I had to squirt the water into it once it was in the fridge because it's so wiggly all the water leaks out. I would think you would have the same problem with baking, that on the way to the oven all the mix would slide to the inside. To use it as an ice cube tray, you would have to put a piece of cardboard underneath. I think the hearts are a little small for baking unless you were making tiny cakes. I'd give it five stars for flexible!
3	After 2 months the bottom of the shoe started to peel
3	I can't really fairly review this product as it was damaged when I received it and I could not assemble it due to a bent component. Doesn't look like it happened in shipping. Returned it for refund and went to local Medical supply store.
3	First one fell off while hunting, never found it. Zippy tied em on after that. Even with that they are so hard to open they pull right off unless you use two hands, which is pretty awkward when you need to open them quickly. FYI, bought these for a Vortex scope.
3	Formulation must've changed. Does not do as good of a job
3	It's really bad. I don't like it. Did not meet my expectations.
3	I loved this color so much and the application is great but the fact that the lipstick already broke off from one day of having it in my purse is a big problem. This stuff is not overly expensive but it’s not cheap either.
3	I really like the case and style. Disappointed in the color. It's more pink than rose gold.
3	Would really love if the replacement lens could be bought separately
3	If it's waterproof, I should be able to pour a cup of water on it without it almost immediately going through.
3	The key did not program to the ignition. Had to pay fo another key
3	Yeah I figured it connects to the stand. Do you have a diagram you can send me?
3	These are nice but it does not give a deep exfoliating clean that some may desire. They’re soft but does not give a deep clean.
3	Honestly a lot of this book felt like fluff. The musical takes the theme and just goes crazy with it. The book is more like a slice of life with a weird computer. The musical is like an actual adventure
3	It works sometimes. You really have to put pin the get it to stay on tight.
3	There were a couple of mistakes in the story line. I almost stopped reading because right in the beginning it did not make sense to me that a character had a gun and was holding it to his head and then nothing happened about his apparent attempted suicide. Later, a phone apparently woke someone up, but then in the same paragraph the phone was dead. So I think it was supposed to say that maybe the phone dropped on the floor and woke the person up? But putting that aside, it was a very good original story. I like the main character and it was fast-moving and interesting. The only other thing that made me leave a star off, is that it was rather short and didn't really have an ending, you have to read the second book to find out what happens. I do recommend this, if you're willing to grab the second book too.
3	Great case and looks fantastic! A part of the rubber on the bottom of the case was snapped in half when it came out of the package. Other than that it is a fantastic case!
3	It's just okay. Flimsy, but what did you expect at this price point? Doesn't hold up things well but only the lightest items. Easy to install and use, and I do use it from time to time, but it's a simple device. Just be aware of it.
3	I ordered this because it was amazon prime. The shipping was delayed and it didn’t get here in time for my wedding 🙁 very disappointing
3	Very strong magnets. Used for hands on activity in a third grade classroom. Magnets are very dirty!
3	For the price I expect more. They ride up and they’re tight at the thighs. I’m not a super curvy girl but it pinched my cupcake handles and thigh bits. Meh.
3	Made me nauseous, even after taking with food. Hesitant to continue usage.
3	Pretty cheaply made. I'll use it just because it's to much of a hassle to return.
3	they are too small for the holes in my ear lobes. I can't use them.
3	Kinda made my hair feel weird and not sure it's working great so far. I have pretty thin hair, so was hoping this would hold it in place. It's okay I guess, just a little different than I expected.
3	It does not work (at all) on round frame bikes; I have a Trek mountain bike (so a pretty typical mountain bike) and it has a round frame, and my road bike also has a round frame. I didn't realize the significance of checking if I had a round frame before I purchased it (as its description seemed to indicate it was so universal).
3	Quick and good price but stopped vibrating after about 1 week.
3	My dog who will eat anything would gag every time I came near her with these. Even covering the pill in peanut butter did nothing. Her previous multivitamins she would take without anything just chew the pill and be done. She does like the treat ones from this company but I was bummed about these considering it’s way more for the same price the treat ones are.
3	Easy to put together, looks great when set up. Not good quality material.
3	I had to throw this in the wash when I got it. It was stained and obviously the box was opened. (The manual inside was all crumpled). 3 stars since it technically functions but was gross.
3	Very chic, clean, and easy to use. However, after having got just a few months the band has begun to snag my clothing or the clothing if others. Wish this wasn't the case & now I'm stuck with it.
3	I didn’t realize these are sticky and don’t want to put on my beautiful hardwood floors because I’m worried it will permanently mess up the wood. The instructions didn’t say if it’s safe for hardwood or not.
3	I actually changed the order to the 6X at the last minute, but you still sent me the 4x size. But they fit well enough so whatever.
3	I liked the product, but when I went to reorder, they no longer carried it.
3	The packing was poor, two of the corners chipped
3	Fit great! Falling apart after only a few miles....
3	I like the style but, it was not bright blue as pictured, was a dull washed out blue; ended up returning
3	Very beautiful bowls. Great if you need extra small bowls. I returned due to Not what I expected. Bowls are much smaller than I thought.
3	needed 300 for a project and fell about twenty short. They were good looking leaves though! smaller than an average leave but nice looking
3	Nice but which I knew it was for the iPod and not an iphone
3	Box arrived with no instruction booklet.
3	The table is good quality but the shipping box and table arrived damaged.
3	My two-year-old daughter like the girl chipmunks on the YouTube videos I thought she would’ve like this but she loses interest in the story.
3	I thought these were good. The bit of sugar on them just tops it off. I was not that impressed with the price for six cookies though, but purchased as an Add-On item. I will not do that again and continue to go straight through the company. If you are just looking to try them out and have Prime, it might be an okay option for you.
3	This took over a month to get here. The direction to assemble it are pour. The product was bent and was difficult to put together. The motor made a horrible noise when we turned it on and we had to take apart the motor case a fix the motor before it would work...don’t buy from this company. I a betting it won’t last a year.
3	It's ok, or gets the job done.. but its really hard to turn on/off. I wish the vibration was more powerful.
3	I guess they'll be OK gym socks, but they're not much for compression.
3	Good but small. Wish it came with ties
3	That little crackling in your ears that you just can't figure out.... ugh... was driving me nuts. I finally ripped the sides off and tore out the little LED bulbs and the crackling finally stopped. The headphones are great now but I wish I had my LED lights on the side to match my lighted mechanical keyboard and my lighted tower.
3	I was very excited to get this because of the good reviews! but to my disappointment... I hardly used it... it was just too much for me... too much straps.. and when I'm wearing it, I cant breathe properly. Although it gave me a lot of support, I wasnt just too happy to use it. I felt bad that I wasnt able to return it right away, now it's just been sitting here at home.
3	I've missed having a kickstand ever since I owned the HTC Evo - my first true smart phone. This kickstand does only work in landscape, but that's OK with me. However, the magnet in the kickstand interferes with use of the s-pen. I also wish the kickstand didn't protrude from the back of the case when closed. I want to rate it higher, but these problems may be enough for me to abandon using the case, except perhaps when I travel.
3	Case is very pretty and very slim , feels nice in the hand. My only issue with this case is it does NOT come up around the edges to protect the phones face if stored face down. Makes the phone seem fragile and not protected but is very pretty
3	You actually have to down 6 pills to get the recommended dose!
3	Good price. A bit on the thin side, but worth what it costs.
3	Not very durable, at least one split at the zipper.
3	I was expecting a book that was not marked up, but the book was completely marked up and had tabs throughout the pages. All pages were in tact, and book was clean, but wishing it was not marked up so much. The book is an amazing book.
3	The trimmer had some really good reviews so I bought it. I was disappointed with the nose trimmer. I haven’t used the other attachments so I’m clueless. But I don’t think a single nose hair was cut.
3	Nice texture. Lovely feel on the skin. Unfortunately it has a smell I don't care for. Sorry!
3	First, three stars is only for this book. The series is so unique, dark, twisted and all things depraved. Ten stars at minimum. But though this was all those things it lacked the heart of the previous books. And I guess the editor was on leave. This author will always be favorite and a given one click. Still, this was a bit of a disappointing end to such a one of kind, like no other work. So, meh.
3	Was suppose to have screen protector did not have one !!!
3	Cracks developed quickly on some of them - not good to keep things fresh
3	My 18 Year old son has Autism and constantly bites the outside of his hands if he doesn’t have a chewy. I got these to try as we have been trying other chews and nothing seems to last longer than a week. My son bites hard and broke through both of these within a couple of days. I can’t say they are not recommended, but I assume it just depends on how hard the chewer bites.
3	I love these! Super cute! My son doesn’t walk yet, and they fall off here and there, but are still adorable!
3	Works as expected but the on button does not stay on without holding it.
3	My only complaint so far is the brightness is not like factory screen. This is my first replacement screen so I don't have anything to compare it to except the original factory screen. Touch and quality seem to be on par with factory screen. Will update review if anything changes but so far I'm happy with it!
3	Stops the door, but doesnt stick well in place on pergo floor
3	Legs keep bending in, and had to bend it back out. A button had fallen off 1 week after buying it. Pretty comfortable though and nice for the price.
3	I did gain some new insights reading this textbook and really like the case studies, but I feel some of the concepts are repetitive. This is also one of the textbooks that I can't read it for more than 10 mins because it gets kind of boring...
3	This keyboard is VERY noisy. and has an old fashioned feel to the clicky-ness of it. I've used several iterations of the Microsoft ergonomic, and ;Logitech version, and this one has some keys that feel a little off to me. the space bar, because it is split, sometimes hides from my fingers.
3	Since installed 1 month ago, it has been decent. Whined pretty bad for the FIRST 50 MILES.... Since, it has quieted down a lot. Definitely met OEM SPECS, no issues with install. The REBATE that this particular PS pump had (Offered by Cardone) has been a time consuming process. Have not heard anything back, nor have I received any rebate/refund for my CORE. Taking their time handing money back over. I would give it 3.5 stars. I WOULD refer this product to a friend... BUT, probably not for high-end/Performance vehicles. BUT, always remember!!... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!
3	Nice. Just very very small item.
3	Very nice looking with high polish finish. Toss the cheap chain away and get something good. I think a bit too tall to wear as a necklace, better suited for a keychain. This one has a small top and is a bit slippery, so I wonder if it would be difficult to open in an emergency. I give it a high grade for looks and a below average grade for utility.
3	They were too small & I didn't realize they had no rubber slip proof material on the bottom.
3	Seen another review stating the adhesive isn’t that strong, It isn’t. Had to use help from another type off adhesive material to keep the screen on.
3	Not easy for me to use. Some others may love it. No problems with seller at all.
3	The carburetor fit fine, My Weedeater started right away but the throttle was rough and needed some fine-tuning. The engine runs sluggish will not rev up.
3	Love these weights. Only ONE issue I've found - they DO rust if you keep them in a humid area. I recommend keeping these in airtight containers if you live in a humid area. Also recommend wiping them off after use if you sweat a lot.
3	I regret this purchase...taste funny........wonder if dog will eat them?
3	works OK, but not super great. I have trouble getting a good seal.
3	These screens are functional. I have noticed they are slightly darker than OEM, and they tend to be slightly deeper (there is a little more screen sticking out the top after installation). If I had not installed 30-40 screens on this model phone in the past few months I probably would not have noticed.
3	Looks good but a bit bulky
3	I loved the concept of the Prom boxes but they are very think cardboard that you have to put together and they have slits to connect them. Not very sturdy and hard to balance, especially on grass or uneven surface. It looks adorable in pictures but kept falling over when we tried to use them for Prom Pictures. It is an inexpensive item so I guess you get what you pay for.
3	I can't say that this flasher didn't work, because it DID work as far as slowing the blinking. However, it made the most horrible screeching sound. Sounded sort of like an angry old cat with an irritating scratchy loud meow! I had to take it out, bought another brand.
3	I like how they look but two of the lights do not work
3	item was good, exactly what I wanted but it was a pack of 3 (which I knew) but the expiration date was less than 1 month away. no way to use that in the time period.
3	I recieve requests and have yet to use the products, sorry.
3	Bought this product hoping it would be the same as what we bought while visiting Scotland. Unfortunately, it was not. The thickness of the slice appears to be thicker in the picture than in actuality. The taste was of the bacon was on the salty side. Overall it wasn't bad and it was worth a try but I would not buy it again.
3	I’ve used lots of transfers, but this time it was a real challenge. I really believe that the hot summer delivery had something to do with it. Parts of transfer looked melted and wouldn’t come off.
3	It looks great on the box but when you hang it all you notice is the bulb. Because there is no cover, it looks unfinished(to me). I'll probably switch it out.
3	Water bottle holder should be on the opposing side of the bag. Also only gaving one zipper means you still can only unzip it from one side defeating the purpose of the versatile strap to either side.
3	They work great, awesome idea, however Im glad I bought a warranty, seems to be of very low quality..
3	First of all let me tell you the lamps are beautiful, I love the look, I love there is a USB port so we can charge our phones. You won’t get a fast charge but you will get a steady slow charge, which is good enough when you are sitting next to your phone anyway. My problem is I got one shade with some junk stuck between the layers, directly opposite of the seam on the shade, so it isn’t easily hidden, because you either get seam or what looks like a spider, to look at. Only really noticeable when light isnt on, or you know it’s there, and you think what the heck is that? (Because you think spider!) I’d like to state again the lamps are a beautiful addition to our room. Ports work lamp can be on or off, just a non spider looking friend in one shade. You probably won’t have that problem with yours.
3	Broke quickly but I loved so much I bought a second pare
3	I hope they brake in fast! They seem Stiffer than a regular shoe.
3	Love the Hydro Flask and how it keeps drinks cold. Like that the bottom is smaller to fit in standard cup holders however the lid is SO hard to get off and there is no closure on the opening so it spills easily. If this had a different lid it would be 5 stars
3	The item comes in a lovely box and I like the smells of the oils but was disappointed to find out one of my bottles leaked out a lot so much so I knew before I opened the shipping envelope as I smelled it! And also several caps were loose or not screwed on all the way.
3	Used for staging a shore house for sale. I washed them before using, and they pilled a lot and left a lot of lint on the dryer filter. I had to brush them and use a sticky lint roller. They aren't very thick, but are nice looking for staging a gray and white bathroom.
3	Very cheaply made broke within 2 weeks
3	Haven't looked into return policy but would return as the size is too big. It works as it says and you will sweat in your mid section. Great concept just wish I could return for smaller size.
3	Product is ok, but not great. No way to hang it and said there were 30 pieces. Apparently I was missing some as I don't have enough ornaments to cover all the velcro that is sewn on. There are 2 that don't have anything for them.
3	The mount hols well and supports the back-up monitor well. The problem is the tension that allows the mount to swivel left and right is too loose to stay in place, and there's no way to tighten it. Had to use tape to stop the monitor from swinging back and forth while driving.
3	For the price you can’t go wrong. Definitely not a snapon tool but who cares for $5 you lose a little quality but save like $55. The only thing I can see ever breaking is that the red handle might slip off eventually one day... some super glue and boom fixed. Its also got some sharp machinery marks and sharp edges but a little sand paper, some elbow greese and 2 minutes of time can fix that. I use this at least twice a week for work and it works fine.
3	I really love this dress. It's very hard to find a maxi dress that's actually long enough for me. Hoping the size stays the same after washing it. However, it came with a stain on the top. I planned on wearing it for family pictures and don't have time to return it and hope a new one arrives on time so I'm hoping we can hide the stain in photos.
3	It's difficult to get into the training mode and you have to play a monthly fee.
3	The one I got didn't work so well, but I think that isn't the fault of the seller, rather the manufacturer. The picture function was fine, the built in microphone was awful and it wouldn't auto focus or stabilize, even when I checked the settings while in video mode. I bought the cameras for its video function so for me, a camera that I couldn't use for video, was kind of purposeless. I returned it and got the SL2 instead, but if you're a novice and just want a DSLR that you can learn with, I would definitely recommend the T6 and for the price, with two lenses, it's a steal. The boxes were all opened inside already, however all of the components were intact and were brand new.
3	I did not like that there was no mounting hardware
3	The item works fine but the material quality is bad. In about few months it looks very dirty and thread blotches at many places . I bought a light color.
3	Unfortunately is not for me, I spend 8 hours in an office chair and I still have the pain on my tail bone, however, it's made of quality durable materials which is why it gets the 3 stars
3	Have three starts because the item I received was a dark stoned necklace when in the picture it shows a light colored one. None the less the product was nice.
3	I found the book tough to read, but when combined with the audio teaching, it's perfect.
3	The part that secures the gun in (on the belt) isn't a quick thing to unsnap. It's not a snap, etc. It's a slide. I think if I had to get the gun out quickly, this would /could be a problem. (kind of important!) For that reason, I probably wouldn't buy it again. Otherwise, it's okay.
3	Overpriced for what it is.
3	The color of the stand is okay. Not my favorite.
3	It works but I have to change the power cord every 3 weeks because it burns up the power cord. Ruins the outlet too.
3	Product is fine. The package was delivered wet from a bottle that leaked because the top was off. Got it all over my hardwood floor and desk. Very poorly packaged. Need a replacement bottle.
3	Nice looking but any water you leave in it turns coppery brown.
3	Hard to find the right key, has to be marked with colored tape.
3	The product was inconsistent lengths and half were broken. A few even broke open for the wrapper
3	Like the way they look, though. They're the perfect size and offer an edgy, yet delicate look that is still substantial enough for a woman who's graduated from her twenties. These did not irritate my sensitive ears over about 4 hours of wear. Given the fragility of the posts, I would be careful not to fall asleep in these.
3	Had issues with it heating up properly and staying on fabric.
3	it was bigger than I thought so I returned it
3	Okay for about a year, then the hard plastic started crumbling badly and had to replace.
3	If your used to creamer in your coffee these will disappoint. They lack flavor and thickness that other coconut creamers have.
3	I bought the product in October, 2018 in excelent condition, but I received a product just after expiration. Thanks
3	Hello - Just after a few uses the air mattress leaks when I pump it up. I've woken up twice on the floor with no air in the bed. How do I go about honoring the warranty? Thanks for your help.
3	Ok, this is a half descent map as far as quality. I really like the material this map's made of. It will definitely take a beating and keep on going. But as far as detail goes, if you're not taking the exact route the makers of this map used, don't expect much more than what other maps offer. If you were to travel the same route, then it's a useful tool. But only if...
3	Okay film. Glad I did no to movie theatre to see it
3	The head of the ring is much smaller that the picture indicated by the proportions. The ring otherwise is nice, but it is miniature compared to how it looks in the picture, probably 1/4” instead of 1”. Sent it back.
3	The picture clearly shows the item sits below the belly button so ordering them is on me. I'm 5'4" and 140 lbs.; I ordered a med. The shorts fit okay, though I'd like them a bit roomier--but again, on me. Be careful if you order because return shipping is 40% of the purchase price. Yikes!
3	I would love this if it was battery powered and I could move it anywhere, but unfortunately you have to plug it in. Other than that it’s great!
3	The item is well made but I find it too large. I am 5'10" 190# and I wear a 44 coat in suits. I ordered the XL 44-46 and it's baggy and sloppy. The side laces are fully tightened and even with thick jacket underneath it would still be loose. I recommend buying a size below your measurements because you can loosen the sides but if it's too large you just have to look like you stole your daddy's vest. Unfortunately return probably isn't an option because I do need it for the bike rally this weekend.
3	I was not please with looking inside my package and no packing inside the box. Pic shows this.
3	Could be a bit larger in order to surround the ankle of larger feet. The pockets that hold the ice pacs could also be larger so the pacs slide in and out easier.
3	Definitely not worth the price
3	Nothing to this. Just 8x11 size paper. Need to use a pretty frame
3	Poor quality, I expected much better quality
3	Flavor is so-so. Not bad, but definitely tastes artificial. Tastes better when It's not the dominant flavor in the drink. I've found SF dark cherry of this brand to be much better than the strawberry. SF brown sugar cinnamon is the worst.
3	They are NOT opaque.
3	Protected cracked within an hour of having it, not the most sturdy.
3	This is the second book in this series but unfortunately, again, the Amazon blurb does not indicate that this IS NOT the last book in the story of Avery and Gabriel. But it is a “stand-alone” book- NOT!
3	Crown on number 60 fell off when taking off wrapper Otherwise it’s cute as can be
3	I haven't taken them out of the bags because "Dry Clean" only is typed on the package! The item is described on Amazon as WASHABLE! This really is false advertising! Manufacturer, which is it?
3	Peeled off from the corners
3	Product came with a tag that said sold as set. It was not a set. Also didnt come with any studded band around the hat. Disappointing that products are falsely advertised. Slightly big my my 9 month old as expected but works.
3	I expect reinforcements in the bottom
3	I have a pair of compression socks that were $25 a piece and I can definitely tell the difference. These are quite thin but they’ll do until I am back home and can get my good socks (currently on a travel assignment).
3	Shipment arrived with three punctured pouches that emptied out all over the box. Otherwise, pouches are as advertised. Haven't sampled yet, as we're saving them for emergency.
3	I purchased this diffuser for my classroom to provide aromatherapy to students. After about six months of daily use, it had become so dirty and sticky that I threw it away. I tried cleaning it without lasting results. I will note, that despite having aesthetic issues, the diffuser was still functional and working at the time of disposal. If I were looking for a higher quality and/or aesthetically pleasing diffuser, I would purchase a different product.
3	The flat fan nozzle opening is a little too big. Does not have the pressure I would like from it. The rest of the hardware is well made.
3	Maybe it is just me, none of my other potting soil has done this though and all of my other plants are fine, but this soil seems to accumulate mold on the top very frequently. It works the way it’s suppsed to as far as expansion but the mold is alarming.
3	Good enough. For the price, I'll take it, it gets the job done but you definitely get what you pay for. The edge of the scraper isnt true. Its cupped an old 2x4 so that's less than ideal
3	Lock works intermittently, have to move lock handle on the inside of door slightly to use keypad to lock door otherwise it does not engage throw mechanism.
3	Great for sneakers, does say can be used for suede but I don’t recommend using it for that. It messed up my boots.
3	Very fragile and difficult to get the battery pack in the middle. Could not even put one on the front spokes are too narrow for the battery pack to fit through.
3	The toy works, but the main problem is its battery life and run time. It only stays on for a short period of time (sometimes a few seconds, sometimes 2-3 minutes). So every minute or so you have to find the thing, and then hold the button to put it into "play mode". Not great for keep your cats amused for more than 30 seconds to a minute.
3	The thing that came in the mail is not what’s pictured. I mean the material is definitely a cheaper quality than other practice mutes I’ve seen, but it still does its job. The main issue is it’s kind of stiff so it’s a bit difficult to actually get on a bridge. But once it’s on there, it works. Also smells kind of cheap/rubbery so I washed it with dish soap and it smells less terrible. But I didn’t want to pay shipping on an actual company’s website, so I guess it’s on me.
3	Hi, I shipped my medium size dress with the vacuum filters. Please ship my small dress to me ASAP. Your item has been returned and my puppy is waiting for her small dress. Thank you.
3	Helpful for getting in extra protein after bariatric surgery, but doesn't have a lot of actual oats in it, and definetely had a protein powder after taste, especially when it starts cooling down
3	I rather get HID kit. LED is only bright at close range but they don't lit up the road as far as an HID light.
3	Could not get them to mirror...but pretty
3	I like the mat because it has a bit of weight to it when sitting in the grass or on the ground. Problem is that I was hitting some drives with a tee inserted, the rubber tee piece tore right in half. Now I basically have a hole in the middle instead. The mat is still usable, but not great.
3	The artificial sweetener taste is too much to get over for me unfortunately. Won't buy this again.
3	I should have read more closely ...I was hoping these would be a good size for packing salad dressing in my kids' lunchboxes but they are far too huge. Not sure what types of sauce needs you're trying to get a handle on, but if you got sauce probs, don't rule out a simple jar. Fool-proof screwtop lid? Classic.
3	nice set for the money - pretty good for cooking
3	Helped pain with Charlie horses. It really helped sooth my husbands pain. We purchased this 3 times.
3	Loved the shirts just took forever to get them!
3	Didn't work as expected
3	The size is great, but it's not very sturdy. Other than that I like it .
3	I ordered the California King & it didn’t cover either side of the bed yet drug on the floor on the end of the bed. VERY, VERY disappointing.
3	Purchased for the price of a full story but only received 1/4 of a story... Great introduction, but no meat or satisfaction.
3	Buttons stick and are harder to press than OEM remote, other than that its ok as a backup
3	Okay used with several ideas and possibilities.
3	This doesn’t fit the Kitchen Aid stand as well as the metal bowl that came with it.
3	Comforter was smaller that I thought. It barely covers the sides of the bed.
3	it was just okay, too modernized
3	Wasn't a huge fan. if you add water, even just 6 oz which it says will make it creamy, it is still liquidy. Once I added 8 oz instead and it tasted like someone had drank chocolate milk and then taken a sip out of my water bottle, if that gives you an idea of what it tasted like. It only comes with 14 servings, too. Since the flavor isn't that important to me anyways, and the nutrition is good, I still recommend this brand, but definitely buy in bulk.
3	Smaller than expected
3	The only problem was for the money I thought there were a few in the package because of the picture. Should have read more.
3	What size are these? These are quite large. Quality and everything is fine just large
3	Not terrible but the end where it opens is obtrusive. The whole point of Bobby pins is to be subtle
3	These dyes are not made for soy blend wax. I tried different colors and could not get the results one gets using dye chips. The candle comes out with dye spots /light areas on it. I blended the dye properly and poured at the suggested temperature. I kept trying over and over. I then bought paraffin wax and the blend is much better. Little help from Maple street though. Not meant for soy blend wax.
3	I had to eat 3 or 4 a day just for them to work. Tastes good though.
3	Stretch out way to easily. Will not shrink back.
3	The safe itself is great, I like the design, although I thought the space might be a bit bigger. Largest disappointment is that I saw it a little later at Walmart for $50 less, even though it was "on sale" at Amazon for $200.
3	A lot thinner than expected.
3	Only 3 star because if you put all in no lights work at all or all will stay on. Hade 2 of them that looks like the connectors were damage that might b y some don't work. But the 2 out of 4 that I did get to work look real good on my 95 Chevy
3	Good and bad. Good: Easy to install. Looks good on the phone. Case friendly. Bad: Doesnt stick to curved edges or the corners. You can press down on the glass in this area and hear it come off. This seems to lead to loss of sensitivity along the sides of the screens. Need to press hard to make it sense a touch. Overall would not purchase again.
3	I really loved it at first then the two ends that you can adjust will not stay stable, they swivel so I can't use it for my phone any longer.
3	I liked the way it looks but too high level. Hard to scratch within the small areas without going over Nothing to intrigue me to travel in any specific area
3	Purchased this because I lost the charging case. It’s ok because it does charge the airpods, but after a couple days I recognize it’s a poor substitute. As soon as either the case or airpods are fully charged, they begin draining the charge even while not in use. I am considering spending the money for the authentic part. Three stars because you can still use the airpods as long as you don’t mind recharging them more frequently.
3	Nothing new in here, plus it is about Dell. If you own a Dell welcome to Hell!
3	It's pretty wide so for a small person like me. I don't find it fit under my neck's curve. But if you are looking for stretching the back if your neck in a tuck-the-chin motion, then it works well.
3	Although i was initially pleased with the product, i have now been disappointed. Three of the coils have failed less than 30 days after being installed.
3	I did not realize the jelly beans were half the size of regular jelly beans. Received a refund because the plastic bag had a split in it and the beans spilled over into the box.
3	I have used the deep conditioner and wish I would've spent the money on that instead of the shampoo/conditioner set instead. I don't notice as much of a difference with the combination shampoo and conditioner that I noticed with the deep conditioner...I'll save my money next time and go back to what I usually purchase...total bummer.
3	printed black and white on foam peice. its not very high quality but it is light weight so i just taped it to my front door glass.
3	My dog loves it. Better priced elsewhere. Bad news: its VERY addictive! Once you start feeding your dog this, there is NO STOPPING.
3	The conditioning spray smells nice and works well, but sadly, I can't use the rest because the spritzer has now broken and I have no way to spray it on the dog. I guess I will go buy a squirt bottle from the store and try to pour the product in there so I don't have to waste it and throw the rest away. I have only used about one fifth of the spray so far. It's pretty ridiculous that the bottle is so cheaply made that it breaks after using it only a couple of times.
3	The splitter jack dongle works well playing music. I also wanted to be able to take hands free calls through the car's speakers like my old splitter jack dongle would and this one doesn't unfortunately. For me it's a turn off, so I am returning it and will continue to look for the ideal that plays both music and calls through the car speakers.
3	Bulky case and the kickstand is flimsy.
3	Not as sweet, tart! Not same breed as Thailand. I have also tried Vietnamese passion fruit. Better than USA grown. Some arrived moldy and owner refunded them.
3	They are on the small side.
3	Been having it for kike 2 years dont see issues.
3	I have been a huge fan of spigen cases for a while now. They have always been really well built good quality. Never had an issue other than normall color fade. This new note 9 case I purchased I'm not happy with at all. Dont like the feel in my hand plus the yellow bezel broke while removing from my pocket. Sadly I will buy elsewhere. I still give the company 3 stars this is the only bad case Ive bought from them. And I've purchased 7 total. I've only had this case for a week when it broke.
3	read this but passed it on
3	Cute set, but I didn't notice any difference
3	I despise how quick the battery goes dead. It's like it's not even a new battery at all. It's VERY slow to turn on. I also would have definitely gotten a laptop with back-lit keyboard.
3	It didn't stay fitted like it should of, maybe if had more pieces to put under the bus and on top of the bus it would of stayed more secured.
3	Like the look and the pen holder. Dislike the fit: does not keep a tight fit
3	Very uncomfortable not worth the price. Will not recommend it.
3	Producing a picture takes about one full minute per image, so when we tried to set up a class photo booth for my son's 2nd grade it was a lot of waiting. Also this may be me, but the view finder did not match up with what came out on the film at all...we sent ours back.
3	These plants were disappointing, dried out and brown. I'm still working to rejuvenate them, but not having much luck.
3	To start this box did not have Netflix installed when I got it and that was one of the reason that I want to get it and also because I was curios about android boxes.... after I ask for help they send me an email stating that I have to reset the box to factory settings and I did, then I have to install Netflix which I did and it is working now,then after that I put it to sleep mode the internet was disable all the time when I turn it back on I have to restarted all the time, so I change the setting to turn it off when the power button was pressed down instead of put it to sleep, now every time that I turn it back on internet is working, but now my short cuts on the main screen are not working I have to go to my apps and look for what I want to see, it says that app stop working for the short cuts which I got no problem with that just and extra click , hope that in the future I doesn't crash.
3	Was a refurbished unit but did have a fair amount of wear on it, specially for being a router. Works great and no complaints on that but it is on the rough side for being "like new"
3	So far in the quality is halfway decent. However the little bags you put them in our of no use to me! I wish you would have put the extra quality and cost into the bags themselves. Rather than adding a little carry your bags.
3	Great ideas on what to use, but don't look for any how to create.
3	The guitar is amazing at the price I paid. The only problem being that the battery holder is very fragile and the tab broke the first time I tried to install the 9 volt battery. After calling support and trying to explain my issue which was difficult because the person didn’t seem to know anything about the product. After sending photos and all the required information I still wasn’t confident that the person understood the issue. Now it’s probably been more than a month and I haven’t received the ten cent part that I need.
3	Bottom not cooked when top is baked
3	Asics has a tendency to change size fittings from year to year. The shoes I ordered were no exception. Too small. Not the suppliers mistake or problem.
3	The directions were so small you need a magnifying glass. Only using as a once use alarm so I can’t comment on other features. Just like that it resets daylight time changes and when electricity goes off
3	That sort of thing needs to be in the description, or clearly readable in the photos, or at the very least, in a downloadable MSDS sheet. But none of those things are available for this item. People (such as myself) looking to restore/improve their cast iron cookware have no way of knowing in advance it's not safe to use this on things that make direct contact with food. I might keep it for some future cleaning need, but I can't use this for cleaning the crud off of a cast iron skillet that is intended to be used for cooking. It might be great for cleaning things that you don't cook food in, but i have nothing like that to use it for right now, so I can't evaluate it for that purpose. The way that vital safety information like is presented (or isn't presented in this case) to the consumer before purchase is definitely part of what makes up a product, and is a valid point for judging a product's quality.
3	Compared to his other books/courses, not a very good experience. Countless errors and programming quirks with his online companion tutorials. Problems affected functionality and completion of this course.
3	Significant rainbow effect unfortunately. It fits very well. Well cut. I did my absolute best to pay attention to the installation instructions. I used all the cleaning items. I pressed it flat. I don't know what else I could have done. Returning it
3	pants are to short for a 6' person Fit is great but needed a 2xl T. Amazon didn't carry that size
3	Silicone ripped after a few months. Love the design though.
3	This duel walker is very well constructed and would be perfect for two dogs who are well trained and show each other courtesy while walking, but if you have one dog who is older, smaller and a good walker and one dog who is slightly larger, a puppy, and a real A-HOLE then you will end up with a little dog who is dragged and bounced around like a sack of marbles and he will be totally annoyed and unhappy during the entire walk while this JERK is having a good old time pulling on the leash and getting himself AND YOU tangled up like a fing rodeo calf. Puppies are jerks.
3	It’s ok pins wasn’t as I expected some pins has scratched and old but for the price I’m paying it’s acceptable I had a problem with my order I order two and only received one
3	Have used a long time. Love the product as works great if you have allergies. BUT the only problem was in shipping...upon opening box last week, it had leaked a lot in wrapped plastic bag I believe because it knocked around too much in box that had no packing and cap became loose. So I have a mess that I still haven’t had time to clean it up. For all I know the container might have cracked open.
3	Product flips up after a couple hours of wear
3	I mean its good but what in thee world is going on with this packaging?? I just lost probably 10 drinks worth of Syrup during the transit of this item alone.
3	I'm disappointed in how this works. You have to use a lever to lift the mixer out of the bowl and it doesn't lift very high. Also, the turning knob used to increase/decrease power - not sure how long this will last. I don't recommend this product.
3	the flat bars only work on late model cars but the other tools work well. The bag for the pump wedge was missing. the whole kit comes in a very cheep plastic bag that ripped during shipping.
3	Cute wig,great color... but the quality of hair is dry. You just have to work with it
3	Worked but dont let them get wet.. they explode open.
3	Nice fit when new but once the lining gets worn down they are at least a size larger. Prefer a snug fit but now they fall off all the time.
3	I purchased this ramp to help one of our dogs in and out of the car. Unfortunately it is too wide, or the door too narrow, and it has to be angled and placed at the front door to be functional. Also, the center hinge is so stiff I cannot get it to close. A better design would have it either be narrower or at least taper. Our dogs are used to agility equipment, so using it is no problem as far as their liking it.
3	With that said it was slipping and uh sliding like Trick Daddy fr Trina.
3	Not sure why this pair did not hold up for my daughter. Mine are working perfectly.
3	It is what I expected. However, compared to a different brand I purchased prior to this one, this one took a week to try to get to lie flat. I ultimately put in under a large piece of granite countertop to do so. With this difficulty, I would not purchase again.
3	The fit on these isn't as tight as the original, so the brush heads will come off in the middle of brushing at times.
3	Initially, I would have given this glass a five star rating. However, I recently dropped it while it was empty on to a carpeted floor and the bottom of the cup cracked on the inner plastic and is now spreading up the side of the cup. I mean seriously, this is not a flimsy cup but obviously not durable enough that it would crack on the inside just from falling on carpet.
3	It hangs a little low and doesn’t fit cans well. It’s okay but I suggest buying something sturdier. There are not a lot of options of this type of product.
3	Little heart logos on the pants not visible in the preview photos look tacky in real life. Would have definitely played a role in my decision to purchase these scrubs.
3	There is no way to set the time to my time zone.
3	Cute looking set here. When it arrived it had a strong smell, a bad one. I washed it and it still smelled. So bad it was hard to wear the gaiter. It took 3 washes before I could tolerate wearing it. Also the able on top of the beanie came off
3	Lasts only a few months but are very comfortable.
3	The forks broke from the side after about two weeks of my 3 year old son and I playing with it. This would be much more suited for a child older than 3..
3	Love the quality and the pictures. This is great for people who want the day to day pages in a calendar form. I only needed the months as a whole on one page so the majority of this book was a waste for me. Had I needed the day to day- I would have given this a 5 star.
3	Vender does not warranty. Tree died within days
3	I was very impressed with the brightness. However, the flashlight stopped working on the second day. I would be glad to improve the rating if the manufacturer corrects the problem.
3	I'm assuming if you're reading the review for this, you've already read the other books- so this will have spoilers for the series overall, but not overly specific things to this book. People say this book ended poorly. Let me remind you, Atticus was KIND OF a shitty person the entire time and did terrible things, and made terrible decisions. People don't like this book because the main character doesn't get a happy ending. How about- sometimes you don't get a happy ending. Sometimes you get what you deserve. That being said- some of the plot is a little 'meh' in this book. Owen is by far the best character of the whole thing, and part of his story includes the best like that Kevin Hearne ever wrote- so be on the lookout for that. You'll know it when you hear/see it. Would have gotten 4 stars, but Oberon in the few scenes he is in is kind of annoying this time around as opposed to being cute. Normally I like his bits, but I just wasn't feeling it this time. For an ending to a series- if you don't need your perfect protagonist (despite him being far from perfect) to remain one, it's pretty good. I was satisfied.
3	Love the product, never received the pump that shows it comes with. Almond oil is awesome for under eye treatment.
3	The item came and the seller was awesome The product itself leaves a lot to be desired. There's no place for the headphones, and the cover makes the touch screen hard to use.
3	I got this for my daughters, and it leaves a pink ring around the their mouths like a mustache. It looks like they've been drinking kool-aid.
3	I've been using these almost a week and I am so impressed. really durable, perfect length, attractive, and they fit my phone, tablet, speaker, and portable charger really snug, it gives a very satisfying click when you plug them in. update* I opened the other to use at work and the metal price is bent so it doesn't stay plugged into my phone or connect well enough to fast charge.
3	Received it 2 months after ordering it and the handle was broken. Super cheap material.
3	These turtles were good, but no better than the ones that you can get in the store for a lot less. They do NOT have real Tortuga Rum in them. It is artificial rum flavor... and it TASTES artificial too.
3	Need plenty of water pressure to operate both at once
3	Quality seems good, but the tops of the socks are tighter than they need to be. Not very shaped to accommodate the calves.
3	Paper folders are very expensive. This one is not and with inexpensive stuff you have trade offs. I have used Yale desktop letter folders before. All have the same issues. If you are looking to just fold a page or two at a time and don't mind a couple of wrinkled folds every 30 or 40 sheets, then this is for you. The problem that I have found with every Yale folder that I have used is that you have to be perfect when you drop the paper in to be folded. Off just a tad and it folds with wrinkles. Sometimes fairly badly. There does not seem to be a way around it. If the unit had guides on the sides to perfectly align the drop in it would be fantastic. As it is, if the letters are personally addressed and you need it to be perfect, you will have a couple or do-overs. For the price, well worth it. Just be patient and careful.
3	Took several days for the DVD player to ship. Once it did, it got here very fast. The packaging was what I was most unhappy about. There was none. No paper, no shipping box, just the box the product itself came in. Not a great business choice in my opinion. I don't live in the best of neighborhoods, and with people being as they are, shipping any piece of technology clearly showing what the item is, is just asking for it to be stolen. (See pic) I haven't checked the actual product yet, hopefully it works. But I won't be buying from this seller again. Too much risk.
3	I was disappointed in this product.
3	They are indeed comfortable, but they're leaking feathers. Not just through the seems, they're coming through the flat sides of the pillow too. The two I have from the Company Store don't have this problem.
3	Was not compatible with Consumer Cellular
3	Mini is right... these are like 1” big each, at best! I didn’t realize how tiny they’d be, but I also hadn’t seen the minis before to know.
3	wow. these were tiny. my mistake. there are so many sizes sold and quantities and really odd prices on amazon for household products, it gets confusing. thought i was ordering 2 larger bottles of dawn and these are little. the dawn itself is a great product.
3	The materials have a nice feeling. The keys have a good tactile feel. The - key on my 10 key is permanently stuck. Otherwise solid and would consider again for the sale price I got it for.
3	Obnoxiously long. I returned.
3	There is nothing wrong with the product at all, it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I just personally don't like it. I'm afraid I didn't like this because it fit extremely well to my phone, which is fantastic, but it makes it difficult to remove. When I decided I didn't like the slot for the card (because it was easy to get the card into but hard to get the card out of) I tried to remove the case from my phone and it was quite hard. At times it felt like I was about to snap my phone, but I did eventually get it off and found a case/stick on wallet I prefer, so all is good. EDIT: The seller reached out to me in efforts to either refund or improve my experience with them, and I really appreciate that. They are fantastic.
3	There is some fading on the top after a few months of using but either then that works really nice. Also not a very strong pressure comes out
3	Will only fit the most basic circular coins. If you have anything more unique it’s not gonna happen. Like these two it just wasn’t gonna go. Had to keep them in their sleeves to make it sort of work
3	I guess I did not really need what it has to offer.
3	metal cap already rusting after a few weeks, for the rest good product
3	Came on very dewy and shiny and not a fan of the bottle foundation that drips everywhere. Good if you're looking for a foundation that makes your skin glow more but not exactly my thing.
3	This filter is not very good, it doesn't feel the water, it doesn't work, I have no use it.
3	My daughter loves this has kept her entertained for hours. However I am only giving it 3 stars due to pieces came broken and the whiteboard bubbled up about a month in and is now unusable.
3	I like the cover design, but It doesn’t stay up & would be to high anyway, the closure tab has no purpose.
3	I bought this to keep in my car for emergency use. When I needed it the batteries had lost their charge, it had been over a year so that is understandable. I had a long USB cable in my car and a USB port so I plugged it in - worked great. Why 1 star it ? It will not turn off turn off. If any one can suggest a light that would better fit my needs please let me know. Note: After a full charge the on off function started working so moving forward I will charge every month
3	The keys have to be pressed 3/4 of the way in to register.
3	The performance is decent for the price--it blends just fine. It gets VERY hot with just intermittent use over ten minutes making a squash soup. So hot, I need an oven mitt to hold it. For brief use, such as a protein shake in 30 seconds it doesn't get hot. It makes a very coarse noise, if held at the bottom of a saucepan. It works, but considering the heat accumulation with no means of dispelling it, it may not last very long. Unpleasant vibration factors into a decision to buy a different blender. I wouldn't buy it again. I have a two speed KitchenAid that neither heats up like this HB nor makes as much noise, but it does the job as well.
3	How do you iron them on, received product but no instructions
3	I usually wear large, but ordered XL based on the item measuring chart. It fit OK in the bust area, but a little wide in the shoulders and it then widens out dramatically below the bust. The flare would have been better suited for a skirt than for a top. If I went down two sizes for the bottom part to be better fitted, then the top part would be too tight. I wish it fit because the pattern was pretty and the fabric was soft. More of a t-shirt than dressy but not see through. Probably OK for ladies who are smaller up top.
3	I like the quality and its look, but I am very disappointed that it did not come with shoulder straps option. For the price your paying it should.
3	First, as a positive, the color is quite lovely. A nice dark-ish teal (not too green, no too blue). As for the case itself, as advertised, it is Ultra-thin, but I would say the "hard cover" part of the title that follows, is a bit of a mislead. It is thin, but so much so that it actually feels a bit cheap, bends super easy thin, and doesn't really have the hard/more-sturdy/secure feel like I was expecting. Also, received an email from the seller thereafter that was advising to be careful removing it from the packaging it came in, so as to not scratch it. Makes one wonder if it's so fragile that taking it out of the company's packaging could damage, how much would it hold up in real life? Anyway, looks nice, super thin if that's what you're looking for, and not super expensive. That said, flimsy feeling enough that I'm not sure how much it would protect the expensive products that are today's smart phones, so I'm going to get a different case for more protection.
3	Colors fade real quick if you have it outside in the elements. Less than 4 months outdoor and color quality looks like i had it for years
3	Opens some can nicely, but not all. It depends on the size of the lip of the can--if too thick, it will not work. It is true that there are no sharp edges, and the can top can be put back on (though not securely) if you don't use the entire can.
3	Bought this try after using the jar version for years. It works okay but feels more watered down and not as good on the hands as the cream that comes in the jar.
3	They were very small when we got them but they’re growing nicely
3	I have been looking for something I liked as much as Benefit's Gimme Brow. I think this is a nice dupe, however, the shade is too dark for me. I have dark eyebrow hair, brown hair, and pale skin. It looks too dramatically dark even though my eyebrow hairs are black.
3	Did not see any difference after 1 complete bottle. Never was bothered by taking the supplements as with some brands
3	Rubbery and Difficult to use
3	Runs very small. I wear XL and purchased a 2XL and it still fits a little snug.
3	Chrome paint on clip came chipped!
3	They smell nice and I like the toy in the middle but it stained my tub
3	Love the purple on it but they are small.
3	I love this product! However, I give it 3 stars because I ordered the white transfer paper but when opened it is the graphite paper. Unfortunately I did not open the box until I was ready to use which was past return date.
3	I bought this product because the Milano one I had was worn out after wearing and washing for 1.5 years. It is nice and thin, grips the wig and keeps it in place. I still use a little glue to keep the lace town in the front. However the velcro section is very stiff and therefore it moves. I have to constantly adjust it to put it back line. Because of that, I give it a 3.
3	Didnt realize how small, returning
3	Was waaaayyyy to small for my furbaby, but it was still so darn cute!
3	To be honest I love the concept and product but I seriously give an F for product care the box came in damaged.
3	Had this welded onto my old Legacy GT and it sounded great! Only downside is you can tell the quality of metal is decent but not great.. hit a curb coming out of the driveway a couple times and it bent the very top flat almost and pretty easily but I’ll give it the benefit of the doubt considering my car was pretty low, so as long as you’re not hitting dips and curbs it’ll hold up well. With that being said the first week I had it I had to carry around a bottle of water in my car to hose down the inside every time I parked and got out as the fiber glass inside is either too dry or just awful quality and would literally light on fire and dump smoke out of my exhaust! After it had all burned out my car was even louder and sounded pretty sweet but I did have to worry before then that my car would light on fire if I didn’t put it out when I parked.
3	My lamp has a shortage already and the polish pills off so fast.
3	This is a gift, hope the recipient likes them.
3	Good quality but a couple of buttons stop working after a month of use
3	The brush doesn’t stay on, and I’m constantly having to put it back on
3	Writing is a bit small on the unit and color fades in the sun after a few months.
3	Not quality expected
3	The product is exactly as described, and my 5 year old grandson enjoyed playing with it. The negative comment is that it took over 2 weeks for it to arrive! I am a prime member who wished to have it in 2 days as a gift for my grandson, so I was extremely disappointed on the delivery timeline. Because of the poor delivery service, I gave 3 stars.
3	Hard to follow....could be better scripted
3	Light is ok but could have come with mouthing screws
3	The material is thick and offers good protection for your iPad Pro. The fit is not good and the iPad shifts quite a bit. It doesn't feel like a luxury product, but you get what you pay for.
3	Outer shell case is great but I was surprised the face protector is made of glass
3	didn't pay attention to the SIZE of this padlock---it's huge. I needed something smaller for the gym locker room, but I kept it anyway.
3	Measured at 3 inches from head to toe and about 1 inch thick. Can be good for party favors but that was not what I was looking for.
3	Seems like it would have done the job of protecting my girlfriend's phone just fine, but it was so slippery that we sent it back right after we received it.
3	The hole for the camera isn't completely open for the lens.
3	I thought it was pretty good, but I am just so excited for Nate and Becca it just felt like filler and teasing.
3	The box came completely destroyed. On a difficulty scale from 1-10 of how difficult it is to prepare and apply this henna is about 5/10. The results only lasted 2 weeks. Will not buy again. UPDATE: Within 3 weeks the henna came out of my hair. I only wash my hair once a week. Barely changed the color of my hair. Still...won't buy again.
3	Liked the ease of install, and shower head works great. The hose started leaking after 6 months. Had to replace it.
3	Glad to have protection, haven't tried it to be able to fairly rate.
3	I bought this hoping to make life simpler than having a faucet connect line into stage filter. The problem is that I am only 1 person and don't use what it says for a family of 4. Then when I happen to go on a trip, the filter is unusable. I also noticed that even though I drained out the water from the pitcher, the top of the filter appeared to have mold on it. On top of that, the filters are quite expensive to replace every 3 months. I am truly considering going back to the counter stage 10 filter. The stage 10 filtration replacement filter was $60 - $70 a year. These filters would end up costing me $100 or more.
3	good for carry on packing
3	The product is a very good quality and very soft. I wear 14 on average, but in these shorts the Large I purchased are just a little snug. XL might have been a little better but was concerned they would be too large.
3	Don't recommend, it ripped right off my pants when I hopped in my car. Doesn't have any protection for top of case either.
3	They do work... mostly. They have held my sheets down from coming off the corners in the night for a few weeks, but it seems like the elasticity has worn off a bit, and it seems that the clamp isn't clamping as well anymore. Especially on one of them. Fortunately, there are 8 included in this pack so I will have to swap it out and see if there is any improvement. Ok otherwise. Update: I'm actually not even using these anymore. They're just more of a hassle to put on than it is to pull the sheet down every night before bed.
3	It was tough to get into this novel.
3	Iron power is not enough for smooth, one motion waxing; continues wax application. Temperature settings is not stable and not accurate. Nevertheless, it does job.... just.
3	The bulb went out after one year of operation. It worked great before that.
3	Overall it’s a good sleeping bag with plenty of space, but trying to put it back into the provided stuff sack is like wrestling a greased pig.
3	Revised after using case for three months: This silicon case seems to have bent on one corner and already needs to be replaced. We don’t know how this happened. After only two weeks: So far it seems great. My wife liked the case enough that I just bought a second one for myself. It is soft, yet seems sturdy. The real test will happen when the phone gets dropped, but so far, particularly for the price, we like it.
3	i purchased this as a christmas gift for my toddler. each item arrived individually wrapped so i opened them all to place into the purse before wrapping. the clasp on the little coin purse snapped off the very first time i opened it. i threw some scotch tape on it and my toddler didn't seem to notice but holy cheapo lol it was cheap and i'm sure my kid would've broken it herself sooner rather than later but to break right out of the box was a bit much for cheap parts and labor! i didn't return it but i definitely wouldn't gift this to someone else.
3	Replaced the original mercury float switch from a 2003 switch. Purchased hopefully thinking the screw holes would line up but they approx. .are 3/8 " longer, had to drill a new hole in bilge to anchor properly to the bottom, time will tell in longevity of the product
3	Only thing I dislike is my phone always wants to turn upside down. Other than that, it’s great.
3	Worked as a replacement charger for the one that came with my MSI laptop. Definitely not as good as the factory one, but it has worked consistently so I can’t complain. For whatever reason it fits very tightly into the charging port, almost to where you feel that you’re going to break it when you plug it in. Ironically though, it always tends to work it’s way out of the port and not stay in without having to reinsert it periodically. One nice thing about it however is that the cable is very long, which some people may appreciate, and it has always worked and charged my computer normally.
3	It's okay but the picture posted is misleading. The pendant is one solid printed image not a see through solid thing, but it's still nice.
3	like them, fit in pocket comfortably but doesn't last very long
3	I don't really like the sizes. Don't fit my fingers well. Also come off too easy
3	Came with stickers on it that I couldn't get off. I bought it for a Xmas present and ended up buying another copy to give as the gift.
3	See through material and it's not double sided. Have not even put it out yet
3	The pieces were seperating from one another the day it arrived.
3	This is a great eyelash curler. So easy to use and small enough for travel. Love it.
3	The application runs too slow on 3 year old Amazon Fire 7!!
3	Really strong, last long, I don't think it smells like leather, gave me a bad headache, smells like chemical water
3	Some work great, some don’t at all.
3	it does not trim very well
3	It's fine, but it prevents my fingerprint unlock from working.
3	Cute, neon colored mesh backpack. I was surprised how big this backpack was. I can put a lot of things in it. I use it for my swimming gear. Towel, swim Finns, swimsuit, water bottle, goggles. I put smaller things in the 2 pockets. I 'm happy I ordered it.
3	I thought the beets would be great, but they were black and yucky.
3	They seem very thing and one may be defective. Not 100% sure yet.
3	I don’t see any difference at all. I still get the bad smells in sometimes from outside.
3	I found this nut butter to be ok - it was good for a quick snack.
3	Nice assortment, decent price
3	Poor quality of the product
3	It's nice and large but the front wheels give me a lot of problems. They do not turn like they are supposed to.
3	Not what I expected, but it's okay.
3	These work fine if you want to save the soda for a few hours, but any more time than that and the soda goes flat as if there was no cap on it at all.
3	Only have the candle a few days and bottom trim is falling off.
3	Advertised as Slim fit but it's definitely regular cut. I'll need to have the shirt tailored.
3	Super cute. Didn’t like that when you adjust the digital clock, it doesn’t sync with the hands on the face and there no second hand.
3	My son is not enjoying the story but it's a school requirement. Book arrived quick.
3	This is absolutely the worst machining I have ever seen on a chair. What usually would be a fairly simple 20 min. assembly turned into a two hour long struggle trying to force screws into holes that are literally drilled at varying angles and degrees. I gave it three stars for being as comfortable as any comparably priced computer chair and negative two stars for being the most awful thing I have ever had the displeasure of assembling.
3	The plugs are of good quality. But I was expecting better construction. But the plugs are only held together by the wires, and heat shrink tubing. You have to be careful when unplugging them to make sure you grasp the correct plug to avoid them eventually coming apart.
3	they pant legs are a lot wider then I expected.. ok for around the house.. I recently started buying clothes on amazon I think this was the last thing.. I end up returning most of the things I buy.. I feel like I'm only keeping these because the other stuff I recently ordered is even worse.
3	We loved this rangefinder, but it just stopped working. Replaced battery and still nothing.
3	Usually i have good experiences with the LG bluetooth headset but this one that I received didn't work properly. Maybe old stock, refurbished, return, I'm not sure but I didn't like it and sent it back
3	Love this case but only had it for a couple of months and one drop cracked a piece off the corner so Ipad will not stay properly. A little disappointed
3	I found it annoying to wear, not as helpful as I thought it would be. I have sciatic and pelvic pain issues, but didn’t find it to relieve either. The weight didn’t seem to redistribute differently. I didn’t feel less pressure or anything like friends mentioned feeling 🤷‍♀️
3	Too clumsy for me. A piece of Junk! Get these, you will be disappointed.
3	Excellent concept. Disappointed in how few topics were covered
3	pretty cheap material...moves around with the weak magnets it has...is a bit short for standard registers...easily gets knocked around even when lightweight drapes brush across it they move off the register. I'll look for better ones next time
3	I got the smallest size but it fit more like a medium or large. My boobs are small but not THAT small. There’s a lot of negative space. Apart from that, they are cute. I just wish they didn’t have the traditional back clasp, because that wasn’t clear from the pics and I hate back clasping bras, especially in a sports bra......
3	They're Easter-themed, but only about half the items are sized to fit in Easter eggs. (If I'm filling Easter eggs for ten kids, I'm not also going to make them favor bags.) Otherwise, it's about what I expected based on what I paid: the items are fine, the whistles whistle and the tops spin. The nicer items were fewer in number: I got two wind-up chicks in my bag and saved them for my own kids' Easter baskets, and four little wheely bugs.
3	This product was a bit lack luster in power. In terms of value, it wasn’t terrible for the price but I wasn’t highly impressed. It is designed very well in regards to shape and flexibility but leaves something to be desired. I haven’t had any trouble with charging or cleaning. Not terrible but I won’t be buying again
3	This is a very nice trash can....... if you can get the lid on. I had to go on YouTube and watch a tutorial on how to do it. That's ridiculous. Do yourself a favor, read the negative reviews about the lid before you purchase. Just know what you're getting yourself into.
3	I like the design for a small bathroom. However during the building process it says to use the wooden dowels, I did on the first hole and the wood started to splinter. I did not use the remaining wooden pegs for the rest of piece and it still came together well. It is a well made piece for a small space. The only reason I give 3 stars is because the wooden pegs in the instructions should not be used.
3	Won't stay stuck in my car at all
3	It is very easy to put together the parts were a little flimsier then I was expecting (I have seen and used similar shelves) we have carpet and children, I made extra straps to secure it to the wall. Even on hard floor I am not sure I would trust it not to fall over. However that being said we did make it work for homeschooling books and shoes. The directions are quite well done.
3	Product was suppose to be grey but was white. Length of them was 5" short. All in all, for the price I got what I paid for.
3	When it came it had leaked a bit on the box. It had oil stains on it. My puppy definitely liked the smell of the box lol :)
3	They work well. For a short time but did stretch out after a week use as I need to wear them all day. The size range is on the small side when using sizing chart for people with lager thighs this is problem as well
3	Would not fit my Ruger 10/22 Archangel stock without modification. Had to file the inside bevels almost to the screw penetration to make it fit. Could not mount the screw in that location as it would not allow the retraining piece to go into place.
3	I like the color nothing else . The bow is not as shown , it’s barely hanging on . The cut is sooo puffy not fitting or smooth as shown
3	Made from a cheaper snap plastic, similar to a hanger, but does the job. Not as sturdy as I would’ve liked or hoped.
3	It's small and a little difficult to read. I would have liked larger text.
3	Cute but too expensive for this quality
3	Magnets are weak, there’s only a few small ones on it. I use it to put plastic name tags in so it doesn’t weigh very much at all and it could not hold them up. I just attached a Velcro strip to the back of mine so it’s not a huge deal but if you’re not wanting to do that or glue more magnets on the back you will not be happy with the product. I also noticed one side of it on mine is not attached.
3	Really good bumper for watch the only down side is if you sweat a lot like I do it will start to get moist under that area start to get white and smell!! But other than that everything else is great!!!
3	The look and quality of the bins are fine. Frustrating though that the sides are slanting, not straight. Therefore, the sizes given are the top of the bin dimensions, not the bottom of the bin dimensions. We were planning to use to store DVD's. Fit is the top, but don't fit in the bottom.
3	They serve our purpose in basketball practice. A little smaller than I’d like but they fit. They are better made than some reviews indicated.
3	Not well described item. Did not meet expectations.
3	It is lightweight and easy to maneuver but does not have the power needed for medium to larger jobs
3	Cute before I washed. Followed directions on tag, but still ended up looking very worn after one wash and tighter fit.
3	Not as fast paced as I thought
3	Very uncomfortable around the neck. Hard to adjust. Doesn’t stay in place. Novelty item. Get what you pay for.
3	One of these did not function at all. The other two work perfectly. We have been using them for the past month or so and no signs of cracking or anything.
3	Great use for my ELL classes. Highly recommend.
3	I like this for our Pomeranian/Husky mix. Works well but not a huge fan of the pina colada type smell.
3	Not as long as I thought? I remember the description saying 50 inches, maybe square inches!
3	This stand is fine if you're really strapped for cash because although the functionality is not stunning, you're getting what you're paying for. It is very easy to assemble but not the sturdiest stand by a long shot. The "prongs" at the bottom (that hold the butt end of the guitar) are connected to one piece of metal and it doesn't fit snugly when you screw it in. As a result, you have to be a bit careful when you go to put the guitar away. Overall, the product is mediocre but again, you're getting what you pay for. Cheap and not the best way to make sure your guitar is secure when you're not using it.
3	They look and feel great but it does pull your hair on your arm a lot making it so you can not ware them
3	Received pen - it was a clearly opened / returned item. The papers / instructions were crumpled and the charging wire was not in the box. Instructions refer to the included charging wire which was missing. Product works as advertised and the actual Pen doesnt seem damaged - but it was definitely returned before and no one checked it.
3	umm try to buy the original, this one is good but usage time is less than original NIKON battery
3	so cute but fogs up my safety glasses.
3	A series of short essays by various authors, some pretty good, some pretty mediocre .
3	I like the tongs. I have hand issues and they are easy to squeeze to grab ice, You push the stem in at the end and they open. But to shut them again, you have to use 2 hands - one to hold them and one to pull the stem back out. Please consider making a locking pair that doesn't require 2 hands.
3	Supernatural. Vampire. Dark Romance. College girl gets kidnapped by blood thirsty vampires. Hot sexy time scenes. No rape. Some jealousy ( it all works out). Recommend for that hot quick read.
3	Not the best quality toy for the price, but it is hard to find Dinosaur Train Toys. Wish they still made these products.
3	For the money wasn’t bad. I went few hours on the river and was ok. The 200 I bought cake and didn’t realize it came with a leak until we were half hour in. And at that time right out box and had not had a chance to drag or hit a rock and was slow leak and didn’t notice till we were half hour in. Was a miserable trip after that. No cell service where we were at and no roads
3	Bought for a blind man could not understand the recording
3	Did not come with a wrist strap as pictured
3	Design is too small!
3	I love the fit an the material, but the color is not as expected. I ordered the skirt in black but it came an it's a dark brown. I mean I don't mind an I'll still wear it I'm just disappointed in the color.
3	I really don’t use it. Thought it would be great for rice. And tried to do the egg as well. But it really doesn’t make me want to use it bc it isn’t easy to get the hot eggs into the mold. The rice doesn’t work either sticks in it or falls apart taking it out. It just useful for play dough for the kids to play with. After a few tries and being more work than it’s worth. The kids ended up with a new toy in the end.
3	Didn't kill the fleas like it used to years ago, so I was very disappointed. I used the recommended the first time for my house and it was like I didn't do anything. Then I did it again a month later but doubled the amount of cans used and it was better, but not satisfied, we are still getting fleas. Two cans did not discharge all the way, which costs money. Will try something else next time. So disappointed. Years ago it was our "go to" product. Not now.
3	I gave this 3 stars because the book is great but the shipping was not. I ordered this for my sister for Christmas. When it arrived, there was no packaging in the box so the book was sliding around which resulted in a scratched cover, both sides. This may not matter to everyone but my sister is a collector so it does to her, and honestly it would bother me as well. I returned it and the second one arrived in the same condition. This time I had them refund my money and will be picking her up a copy from the book store. I returned it with a comment about the packaging so hopefully they change it.
3	Well made. Color options are good. Reason for my 3 rating is that if the light is in the open and it snows because it does not give off heat the snow covers it and the light does not display as intended.
3	I didn’t expect this to be solid wood but as soon as any material other than cloth comes in contact it scratches/dents. My little dude is an animal but He was literally able to just grab the brackets for the hinges, pull, and they come right off- screws and all. Handle hole covers don’t stay on either- pop right off. Wish I hadn’t wasted the money.
3	I really wanted to like this product. I hate having to wash my hands free bras all the time, so I thought this product would cut that part out of my routine. I always find myself using this only when I don't have a hands free bra available because they're dirty. It takes way too much time to put on and set up the pump to the right spot to get a good flow going.
3	Part of the band broke not looking after buying and I was gentle with it. Liked everything else!
3	Nice top although it runs a little small. I won't be able to wear a shirt under it but that's ok.
3	I thought they were bigger but I guess I should have checked the dimensions!!! Otherwise very cute and durable bags.
3	Very basic and very short. About 4 pages.
3	It works fine and the price is right. Send to lose connection when the Computer restarts but simple enough to re establish
3	Very cheap material and poor design.
3	You cannot tell from the pictures or description that these hang bu ropes not chains. Very difficult to get the ropes leveled. Had to order separate chains.
3	I guess I should have paid better attention to the other reviews. The 90 degree bend connection on these cables is backwards. This means that you can't have a nice, smooth, strait line between your motherboard and drive. Instead you'll have kind of a loop where the cable has to go up before it goes down. This loop actually steals at least an inch of length from the cable which means there are 2 drive mounts in my Core 500 I can't reach. I do like that these cables don't have a clip since I bought them for a mini-ITX build and the little clips can be hard to to in the tight space between my mother board and power supply. Photos to follow. Still debating if the return process is worth it for $6 dollar cables.
3	It works fine but a big reason we got this one is that it says the battery can last up to 5 hours. Maybe this means if you don't play a movie and just leave it on. Either way, the battery lasts less than 2 hours. Our kids can watch Toy Story one an half times before the battery dies. Other than that it's great for kids on long car rides.
3	IIt's good, but a bit difficult to pull in and out. ALso difficult to reach the back.
3	On one unit the brass casting leaked as soon as the water was turned on. With that record, no sense even trying the second unit, Update: revised to 3 star based on vender response - furnished full credit without need to return & then I installed the 2nd valve, which operates without any sign of leakage
3	I like that is does help repel the mosquitos but not for long. I was using it for a vacation on Mexico. At first they were working really good but with in a week and a half they did not work any more and i was replacing them evey week. Even wearing 2 or more bracelets at a time.
3	I wouldn’t buy again but they were a gimmick for Easter. Mostly for family with dogs.
3	I liked the price but the inside is starting to rust. I've had it 2 months & use it almost every day. I'll buy a glass one soon
3	This book could have been summed up in two chapters. I mean, I was bored and needed something to read but not the same thing over and over and over again.
3	When it said All Occasion I assumed there were birthday cards, too. I was disappointed. There are more new baby cards than I will ever use. I debated on returning them but decided not to. Thanks.
3	I cannot get into the apps that I have on my iPhone. It's very frustrating! Seems to push me to apps that are similar which I do not like. I would not recommend it. The positive is that it's very durable.
3	I like the product and I want to give it 5 out of 5 but the problem is that my box had ants. I just tossed the box. I had ants delivered to me....
3	Movie is great. Shipping was not. Pay for two day shipping and didn’t receive it in two days. What exactly am I paying for?
3	They look good. They work ok. I have not had any water or condensation in mine and I have owned them for 9 months. The only gripe is the bulbs it came with are junk and even with Sylvania ultra bulbs the light is scattered and not directed very well. It is usable for me but my old eagle eye lenses projected better.
3	the color and fit are perfect. The material does wrinkle when washed:-(
3	Nice bowl and very sturdy.
3	Cute movie but it did not match the story line of the book. Really should have been given another name. My 6 year old lost interest about 1/2 way through but my husband and I watched it.
3	The pieces for the back work fine but the front window wind deflector prevent my windows from going up all the way.
3	I liked this well enuf at first, but 6 months later it's so loose that I have to replace it, and it won't be with another one of these.
3	Very useful. But, it doesn't exaclty stick to body of the galaxy buds. It happened to me sometimes that upper part came out.
3	The puzzle was fun to put together, but when I finished, there were THREE PIECES MISSING!! That takes a lot of the sense of accomplishment away. Hard to understand how this happens - ?!?!
3	I have two small dogs. Although they are small, they go through toys very quickly. I was happy to find a bag full of ropes and some other toys for my pups. My dogs love rope toys and I find that they last longer. I love the variety in the bag and so do my dogs!
3	The band was pink, but the color faded after 2 months and it is now off white.
3	The copter flies good but it is not very durable in a small crash easy to damage
3	My iphone says it's "not a product that works with my phone" so I had to find my original. Not real happy. For some reason works OK in my car.
3	Good looking item and hope I don't have to return it, as one of the rings is loose and I received the item in a plastic pouch without the stated manual nor bag posted on the Amazon product description.
3	Kinda cheap but does the job
3	Was very good the first 6 months of use due to the mist expelled off center, once the mist began shooting straight up, it would fall back on to the Unit itself and leave a pool of water and miscalculated the relative humidity of the room since it would be very humid around the unit.
3	Bought while didn’t have time to go out shopping. While the case is good for protecting the iPad, the magnetic screen cover is pretty weak. My chief complaint is that while you can prop I to viewing-position as seen in product photo, it is a bit unstable and it will not prop upon the semi flat position at all. All said I haven’t replaced it yet but that’s laziness on my part. The price is right for a stop gap measure but not for the long term
3	Ordered 2 hats for my parents. One was fine, the other was broke. The velcro strap on back of hat was poorly stitched to hat and it came off. My mother said it was fine and she would sew it back on. I didnt return but disappointed with quality
3	I’m sure this is a great product but my cat does not touch it. It has a minty smell and makes foam as you pour water in the cup. We are using a different product and my cat tolerates that one
3	Got these because I make soy yogurt and it turned out these aren't quite big enough.
3	Suit fits very short and wide. Barely covers my daughters chest, but gives her a constant wedgie! Came with a bonnet type hat, but it is tiny and only fits on her baby doll’s head. Disappointed it didn’t fit because the suit is very cute!
3	i liked this products, many colors of acrylic paint for said price. Only downside to it would be the pigment. I'm not sure if it was just my batch but it seems to me that these colors aren't as bold in color as other acrylic paints i've used before. Any of the paints i've used before only needed 1 coat of paint, this is sheer to where i have to add at least 2 or 3 coats for it not to have the transparent sheer type look. IDK man, but this was my experience
3	...but once I realized the TRUTH, relaxed and had fun with the movie. Acting so so and script so so, but laughed a lot. For that, 3 stars. Kudos to the Italians for the spoof? But, don't discount government actions that are true splattered throughout the movie. Sad how they see us.
3	These are beautiful but run small!
3	This item is great because there are multiple pieces in the bag, but the belly rings break easy.
3	I got a medium and it was way too big for me.
3	It was a great screen replacement, it felt durable and resistant. Unfortunately, I had to send it back because the camera didn't work. Other than that, I didn't have any problems with it.
3	Would give this item 4 or 5 stars cuz they seem pretty well put together and they're cute for the price. My problem is that one of them arrived broken and there doesnt seem to be a way for me to request a return or exchange through Amazon. I purchased these to go with an outfit I'm wearing to a wedding and luckily the one I plan to wear wasnt the broken one, but it would still be nice to receive a replacement.
3	Literally never owned a book in worse condition.
3	I really loved these boots at first, but as I continued to wear them the heal broke down. Now I am unable to wear them.
3	Plain cotton dress. I ordered this too big. An xl. I'm 5'3 153 very curvy. Wouldn't recommend.
3	They fit by laying on top of the grease filter, but get sucked up by the exhaust fan when it is turned on because they are not attached to anything
3	But helps with pain associated with a shoulder problem and sure beats going to the doctor and probably getting referred for surgery.
3	MISSING PARTS/BOXES WERE OPEN PRIOR TO SHIPMENT
3	It is a nice leash. I like the padded handle and the velcro to keep handle close on leash when not in us. I think it would be even better if the extension part had ability to attach as well to itself or be shorter by 6 to 8 inches so it could wrap around the dogs neck once and clip to collar ring for "onboard" storage and quick access while running free.
3	Eh. It doesn't hold as much as I would like. It's really heavy and bangs against my legs and gives me bruises when I try to open and close it. When it's closed, it doesn't roll.
3	Its a bit flimsy and not the color in the picture. Its the purple blue color but translucent so you dont really get the color like in the picture. Kind of disappointed.
3	I haven’t noticed much difference but I’m about 20 days in.
3	Ran a little big so they all got lost very quickly
3	Box came open and retaped. Product thankfully isnt damaged
3	It does track your heart rate, but the measurement seems a bit low (on mine at least). Works okay for telling if your heartrate increases or decreases so if you can match a reading with your target zone you can use it to maintain a target heartrate (though the exact bpm of your target heartrate might not be perfectly correct). It's got a pedometer too which works okay, and the app is kinda cool.
3	It came out of the package dented
3	Not too happy with his purchase. The slinkies were off. The unicorn came with a wing missing. And you have more bags then you have product for. I thought it would fill 12 bags but it doesnt. If you put 1 of each thing in a bag your only filling 9 bags.
3	Hard to use. Tiny squares. But got the job done. Hint- turn off ac and any fans in area!
3	They do what they say - but very annoying./tough to open\ - no matter how many times you do it!
3	It does bubble. But the candles sit crooked. The plastic foliage doesn’t attach and isn’t long enough to wrap all the way around. Only supposed to run it for 4 hours.
3	Product is fine but arrived with a broken flip cap. Bummer
3	Well it's just for a night!
3	These will come unwrapped from the ring very easy.
3	Easy to install and remove. A lot of vibration and passenger side will vibrate all the way down and out. So I get a great view of the ditch. Not horrible. Just needs some work.
3	This book is not a how to, it is more of a memoir. It was well written and there were several good ideas I highlighted and will return to. It is motivating and I am interested in being more mindful of my spending and taking the challenge to change my own habits.
3	The reason I gave this product a 3 star is because although I liked and fit well I wore once on vacation was in water less than 30 minutes when took off the inside sole had came loose on both shoes. :( I was able to put back in but now fight them on the rolling up inside shoe.
3	Daughter is 1 she can pull the nozzle out and the water dumps everywhere
3	The waist fits perfect but the length just barely makes it. When I got the paints they came through regular and that should have been mentioned on the site. I have a 34 inseam and as long as I don't hem the paints there good! Just don't look close at the bottoms. Otherwise there very nice and comfortable.
3	Very cute but it was such a pain in yhe butt getting the wrinkles out.
3	This was a gift and dont see any instructions in box . Do you just set watch to correct time.
3	They are useable, but they do fulfill a bit of their intended use.
3	Not as soft as we expected. We have other sheets from Costco that have a lower thread count but are much softer and smoother.
3	The book is good except that pages 225 to 240 are upside down.
3	Just got this yesterday. While I'm sure it will be a welcome addition to the home gym, it did not arrive with a carrying strap as advertised. Fair warning. It is long, and nice and thick, but does have a strange smell upon arrival.
3	Haven’t had a chance to use it.
3	This synthetic stuffing seems softer than the others as it's more slippery - so it feels softer when laying on it. Still evaluating it but so far it's not cooling off during the night and is getting warm.
3	Don't like crushed tubes.
3	A couple of the frames had black scratch marks on them. Otherwise, got what I expected.
3	The product does well in the vigorous environment that my friend and I put it through, however one day a piece of the handguard fell off and is still missing. sword still is balanced and works fine.
3	Responsible seller The computer is good but it was not what I was looking for. I returned it and they reimbursed me the money
3	A little tricky for our toddler to control, but it is cute!
3	Was a great experience at the start, they fit so well, packaging was fantastic, charge case was sturdy. I really never wanted to take them out because they molded so well to my ear. After a few house use the left ear bud continuously cut out at random intervals.
3	I ordered these in white and black. The black box had a black sticker but the contents were white.
3	NOT AS THE PICTURE SIZE IS ABOUT RIGHT.
3	Great price but material was hard and cause my wrist to break out.
3	I have a bunch of retractable usb micro and mini cords and love them. I liked to keep a small travel charging cube and two of the cords in my purse so my husband and I could both charge our phones when traveling. Now my husband and I both have USB C devices. These are NOT compact like the mini and micro ones. I genuinely think they take up more room than just a neatly folded cord would. I'm sure they're fabulous quality, but they won't be living in my purse as they're the same size as my wallet each. Maybe in the suitcase, or maybe I'll continue to search for a more compact version.
3	Don't find dried fruit, except for raisins in each package
3	works perfect for me, but I only got 9 out of 10 pregnancy tests......
3	It's an okay handheld vacuum. The price was good and I needed something to clean my car. Suction isn't the best but it does the job.
3	Pretty and a good size but take more effort to use than most scissors. Would not buy again.
3	I'm glad I went with the next size down or they would of been to big I like them alot
3	Squeaky, the arms were a B to secure, and it gets pretty uncomfortable after a while
3	The photo tells all in terms of the selection. It's a nice selection of holiday rubber stamps. The stamps I received were low on ink as some other customers have reported. This is easily resolved. I washed out the ink pads in my kitchen sink, let them dry, and then applied refill ink in the color of my choosing. It's possible that might be problematic if you're trying to use a light refill ink (say, yellow) on a stamp that had dark ink in it (say, black). But I'm replacing all of the colors with red, blue and green, so it's not a problem. Search Amazon for "rubber stamp refill ink." Apply a few drops, press the stamp a few times to get the excess ink out, and you're good to go.
3	Don't like it. Doesn't work properly
3	If you like Tony Hillerman and are invested in his characters, you will enjoy this book. However, this series has gotten a bit long to me. The plot is weaker than in earlier novels. There is less Indian lore. Also, there is a rush at the end to the up loose ends that seemed almost artificial.
3	The only issue i had with this is it gets very hot, it doesnt stay cool when you're sleeping. Otherwise its lightweight and very comfortable.
3	The plastic piece came cracked and it is missing a foot on the bottom of the board. Other than that it’s decent.
3	My dogs were still able to chew a corner of it off
3	I didn't particularly like the sparkle pins. The look too plastic for my taste and it didn't blend well with the flowers. I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't bad but not what I wanted. I need it to bling and pop more out of the flowers. Very dull shine.
3	It was good but comes apart very easily it took me about an hour and three YouTube videos to put it together
3	The point is not really sharp at all. I had high hopes of using this for weeding vinyl, but this is just okay. It certainly won't work for fine weeding, but it's okay for big designs.
3	bulky to carry around
3	Being smaller chested they don't cover smoothly. They bunch up. Not saying that they are a bad product but I find them to big and flimsy. Probably because I'm used to smaller stiffer ones. Just my preference.
3	The harness fit our dog perfect. The reason i am giving it 3 stars is because the stiching is uneven.Some letters are bigger than others. Almost like a kid stitched the letters. Other than that, it is a good harness.
3	I personally did not like this scrubber...one side is soft..the other side is hard as a brick
3	The chargers break very easily. I had to order a replacement set because one arrived broken. And of my second set, two have broken already.
3	I had the protector on for about a week and it cracked at the top. Yes I put it in my teeth to hold the phone when I needed 2 hands for something. I would expect that if I can hit with a hammer, that my teeth wouldn't crack the protector. Not satisfied.
3	This is really fun but because the pins aren’t magnetic and have no way of staying on the lane it is very easy to lose pieces.
3	It may be my floor, but this mat does not stay put. Roger Long
3	Good build. Works well after setting up. Have to dock a few stars because the setup is unnecessarily complicated.
3	Pros: Looks great and feels great. Nice size (for somebody who has gorilla hands) and it felt comfortable during the time that I was able to use it. Cons: Mine arrived with a bum left-click, which is kinda the most important button. Will be returning the mouse, but hopefully others have better luck.
3	I looked this up online after seeing someone use one of these on the TV series Orange is the New Black. I thought, what kind of popcorn popper is that? I was intrigued, and ordered one. my microwave is over a thousand Watts so it heats up very fast. I just go by the instructions on the popcorn popper, and use the popcorn button on my microwave. I stop the microwave about 30 seconds before the timer goes off. if you don't, you will get burnt popcorn every time. in a nutshell, it's a fairly good popcorn popper. you can save money by buying your popcorn in bulk.
3	A good glimpse into the roots of rock and roll, and the excesses of the culture. Rock n' rollers are egotistical by nature, but in spite of that, it's still an interesting read. I look forward to Stephen Stills' autobiography to get another perspective.
3	I bought these in large for my 13 year old daughter for basketball. She said they were comfortable and easy to put on. The only downside was they started to break and rip on the padding part after her 2nd time of wearing them. She was not diving on the floor or playing aggressively so I was surprised they started to come apart like they did. They were still usable, but the padding should have lasted longer than two wears. They were not bad pads for the price though.
3	Zipper broke within one week. Pull tab is weak and should be upgraded
3	These are cute, but unfortunately the fabric snags very easily! The tie back that comes with the panel snagged mine despite my best efforts to put it on carefully ;(
3	Was not completely satisfied with product. Too much prep to move obstacles and instructions were incomplete.
3	Loved shoe hated width.
3	Very small. Touchy controls
3	I get a blister on my forefinger using the scissors. The hole must have a rough edge... And, it's tight with the insert in it which also rubs.
3	The clubs are as advertised. The bag, however, is garbage. Unboxing the clubs: The club cover was ripped, a zipper pull was ripped off and sitting in the bottom of the box, and the zipper completely snapped off one of the pockets so now it just hangs open. It's as if this company put together a think tank, did a lot of R&D and consciously decided to make the worst golf bag ever assembled.
3	My fav brand is Braggs, so tried this one, wasn't too bad but I didn't like how it was in a plastic container.
3	It works really great. I had it on my old phone and it protected my screen a couple times. Saved me a bunch of money in replacement screen costs. I liked it so much I got it again when I switched too the pixel 3a. EXCEPT that it doesn't seem to cover enough of the screen. It is exactly the width of the part that lights up but it doesn't leave ANY room on the side. If it was 2 millimeters wider it would be perfect.
3	Looks great but memory foam is too thin to matter, meaning not very comfortable.
3	I got a pack of these because I was having cravings to smoke again after quitting 15 years ago, but I can't have nicotine. The smoke is so thick I couldn't inhale them, and one pack broke me of my cravings, which was great for me. Smells like incense, which wasn't unpleasant.
3	Nothing too great but for 7 bucks it’s a decent knife. Pretty sharp and serrated but the style is pretty simple.
3	I am only giving it three stars bc some do leak when tired on there sides. Another problem we ran into was a few rollers were hard to roll but other wise they work great I would suggest getting a roller case to prevent tip over and leakage bc oils are expensive
3	"You thought about three things at once, and in full detail. Are you sure you're a kid?" "She's really smart for a kid her age, and her ability to analyze information defies belief." I feel like the author was never thirteen years old; he seems to think that anyone under eighteen should be incapable of thinking things through. The author uses his position that children are idiots to justify constant reminders that our not completely idiotic main character is a genius. It's very irritation, but just like the first book, despite the irrational people and the terrible justifications for our main character's strength, I mostly enjoyed the book. I hope there's a time skip soon, so the author can stop feeling the need to remind us of how abnormally smart our protagonist is for a child.
3	Bought two of these for a long hallway. Not satisfied with the (lack of) thickness, felt rough using bare feet. You get what you pay for? Returned.
3	it scratches off. i've had the necklace for two days hanging on a Wall. i look at it. a huge scratch on it in the picture... the picture itself is printed not engraved. other wise. good quality picture.
3	The inside white pocket is shown on the edge of the pocket on one of the pants but i can wear them by wearing the shirt untucked.
3	Neat pens, but arrived crushed. Was shipped in bubble wrap envelope, but a few pens were busted & package was crushed.
3	Great packaging; unlike any I have seen for tempered glass. Too many bubbles because cut too big. Had to remove case because protector was literally edge-to-edge and still not sit right. I guess I got that one bad one in the batch 😕.
3	Was expecting it to be bigger
3	After a week I had trouble getting them to charge right
3	Functional, but not very sturdy.
3	I used this product a two hotels and the lightweight of it, I thought would be awesome for traveling. When i turn it on, it has a rattle after it gets going that’s annoying and was not there in the hotel product.
3	I have bought two pairs of these, one teal frame and one black frame. I like the size/shape and the gray lenses. However, both pairs have started deforming on the ear ends and are rippled and bumpy.
3	Some are not attached to the necklace holes
3	I would order a bigger size because it’s a bit short but you can tie it in the front to slim the waist. I like it.
3	I like everything about this shirt,except the pockets. It feels nice and fits nicely, but the pockets stick out weird. I'm going to try to sew them shut, because I really do like the shirt otherwise.
3	A nice collection of crimp sizes and colors
3	It’s an ok chair for the price. My son is 13 and it is a little small for him. Thought it would be bigger.
3	So its top notch quality except for a few minor details. A. It's a bad height. At its maximum height I have to do a 90 degree bend over for it be anywhere near sound projection placing, sitting down. It's not tall enough or can stand in a way to put on a table. I mean its inbetween knee and hip height. It's weird and I didnt expect that. B. Its legs dont seem to hold in any position but completed extended flat which means they cant help the height issue. C. As soon as I put a microphone on the thing it started to topple. It cant handle the weight of a single microphone. In any position, I had to put weights on the other side of it to counterbalance. ... that being said the parts look very sturdy and everything connects well and I doubt the stand itself will ever break even if it falls down a lot. So that's good.
3	This cover worked well and seems very protective until I started exercising with it on. Sweat gets under it every time now and then you can no longer control the watch until you take off the bands, remove the case, clean it and the watch off, and then put it all back together. Works fine for my daughter who does not sweat as much.
3	These were great however one of the bottles didn’t work. Don’t want to return the whole lot because I already used them but then the last one’s pump didn’t work.
3	I had many compliments on this bracelet from the color to the craftsmanship. The thing I didn’t like and I bought two one for a friend, was they both broke within a week of each other. They lasted 3 months. The thread that holds the stone broke.
3	The earrings are nice but they hang unless I put them on really tight . Look better on the pictures.
3	I've had the single ear version for a year now and it is great for phone calls. I've never had a problem except in really noisy areas. I decided to try these for music as I wanted the completely wireless experience especially while flying. They work, as others noted they don't do well outside or in large indoor spaces like an airport. One or both units drop out frequently when you turn your head or stop working altogether. I can't take the dog for a walk with them. This I think is more the technology than the product. I have issues some times using other bluetooth headphones while outside. I also had one of them go into some kind of fault and would not turn off (a particular issue with these I've had, could be my big fingers). There was a buzzing noise and no music. I let the battery die (which seemed to take longer than when in use) and after recharging have worked fine. The battery life seems poor. On more than one occasion I believe they were fully charged and they died after a short time. I did expect more from these based on my previous experience, and I am disappointed in them. I would not recommend these and I'm not sure I would trust this company to buy other products. In doors in the office or at home they work fine. For airports, costco, and outside I would suggest something else.
3	These yeezys are okay quality but are horrible if you look at the details. A really addidas yeezy 350 has BOOST write on the bottom these stayed sport, they also had sport written all over the shoe. All other fakes have the real easy embroidery. These are comfortable but horrible fakes.
3	overall fine, but if you want to install it to some seat with too many functions (i.e. lines), you would have some trouble.
3	Case fit great and had a great clip for belts, but the plastic is very weak and only lasts so long. Have to be very careful when removing from belt. mine just snapped off.
3	Was missing the adapter at to return it cannot write product review
3	This item is a quality countertop convection oven and seems like a good value for the money. I am rating it only three stars for one reason. We bought it specifically because the ads clearly state that a 13x9 baking dish will fit inside. If that baking dish has handles, it will NOT fit inside, and frankly I have never seen a baking dish of that sort without handles. So be advised that the ad for this item is somewhat misleading. Other than that, we are satisfied with the oven.
3	Comfortable, good quality sound, all I can ask for except the headset cuts out randomly when plugged in as a USB. Easy fix all i have to do is unplug and replug but still an inconvenience.
3	Doesn’t like to work from more then 5 feet away
3	DID NOT WORK GREAT FOR ME, MAY NOT BE WHAT I NEED FOR MY ISSUES. THE PRODUCT IS VERY WELL MADE AND COMFORTABLE THOUGH.
3	I'ts okey.Didn't use yet.
3	this HUGE box was left blocking my entry door, was partially unsealed and is missing almost half of one side.
3	I'm a C and they sent me a medium when I ordered a large. Was too lazy to return it as the nearest UPS store is 30 miles from me. Its too tight towards time to pump again and its so uncomfortable. Also where the fabric meets rubs on the nip and can be painful. Overall its not bad for the price, maybe I'd like it more if the right size was sent.
3	This table is a great size for my apartment. I like the way it looks. Also, price was great!!!! The things I don't love about it: -it came with a small blemish/problem on the top of the table - its short, the way the bars are in the middle make it hard to sit close to the table, you can't have your legs totally under it, so while eating you are further from the table than you might want. (or at least farther than I would normally want) -the directions, in my opinion were confusing, specifically when you need to connect the black bars, it was a puzzle that I did not figure out very easily. Once I found a user video, it helped tremendously. I love the way it looks, the price and the size for my smaller apartment.
3	It looks fantastic and is better quality than expected but it is very small. I have a small head and i can barely get it on. I had to cut off the chin strap and its alot better now but still tight.
3	The magnet isnt that strong whenever I close my refrigerator or freezer sometimes they fall off
3	Sound quality and comfort are fantastic. However, they are not durable and have consistent issues with the wires fraying. When they honor the warranty this is great, but in my case as the Amazon seller is not on Etymotic's "authorized" list, my 2 year warranty is invalid.
3	This little vacuum is a good value. The main attachment is good for cleaning up pet hair or crumbs--there's suction on the top and bottom so it's great to stick in corners or behind couch cushions, etc. I keep it in my car to vacuum the seats and other nooks and crannies. But it's not the best on flat/hard surfaces. It's also not the best at getting dust if you don't attach the hose. The exhaust on the sides it really intense and might blow the dust away before you have a chance to vacuum it up. Also, if you don't empty the canister after every use or keep it upright, the dirt/hair/dust can just fall right out again. Finally, it's very loud. But for the price, it gets the job done and I'm pretty happy with it.
3	I enjoy movies from this time period, mainly cause I love seeing the antique furniture , buildings, etc. And I love George Sanders and his brother...Tom Conway. This set has some good story lines, and the pictures are clear and sound very good. My only complaint is the way they kept using the same actors and actresses all throughout these movies. Acting is very good though...but the sameness gets redundant and a bit boring. Some of the same lines are used, throughout the movies. I was born shortly after these movies were filmed, and I recall much of what appears in them...the building styles, furniture styles to some extent, and some of the clothing styles were still popular in the 1950's. ..I was a very young girl but I recall a lot of this. Brings back memories. Was a simpler life back then...slower, more easy going. People were nicer to one another and more polite. I miss that.
3	Did NOT expect it to be ther size of a barbie clock. I couldn't stop laughing when I opened the box.
3	My 7yr old son loved these, some of erasers we're hard to make but we we're able to just make our own creations which still was fun.
3	Not quite as the picture depicts.
3	it's nice when a little nippy in a cold living room, or when you come in from the cold and need to get your hands warmed up a few minutes
3	Donahue and Sally has had it a bit rough in life. Both has experience quite a bit of trauma which they are trying real hard to overcome while at the same time trying to live life and keep their head up.
3	I bought this item as a Christmas present for my daughter. She loves Frozen! It seemed simple enough to mix the colors and paint the statues. However, the paint would not mix well enough to make the colors that were needed. Ended up buying extra paint to complete the project. Overall, I would still recommend the product. Best of luck mixing the colors to match.
3	Mildly flavored not strong enough
3	First, I am really enjoying this natural deodorant as an alternative to the majority with man made aluminum in them. I love the smell and i look forward to using the strawberry one for my daughter when she gets older. However, my sprayer has become clogged of some sort because it no longer sprays but squirts in a single stream :(. I am disappointed. I tried soaking the cap in hot water to which it worked for the next spray and then reverted right back to that single stream.
3	Very comfortable inserts. They fit good in my shoes , the only thing I noticed with these , is they made my shoes smaller and fit tight. I recommend on putting them in shoes that are to big for you.
3	Hat is not what it appears to be in the picture. I ordered the khaki and the picture is somewhat bright khaki , in reality it is more drab brownish in color. Also...the hat was shipped in a bubble envelope and was squished when I took it out. Picture shows a ' full bodied ' well shaped hat. Sits on my head like a squished , wrinkled , old fisherman's cap. It's okay , but don't expect what you see in the photo.
3	It wad nice but bulky
3	Seems like a decent thermostat. But I couldn't get it to actually control my furnace. Had 2 different experts out here. Had to uninstall.
3	An entertaining series
3	Very nice But too large
3	Have an older dog with a weak bladder. This takes the smell away until it dries then seems to come back.
3	Bike came 97% assembled and was packed very well. It was very easy to unpack and fold to ready position. Just had to attach one pedal , tighten some bolts and your done. Bike was moderately heavy but felt sturdy. The only problem I had with the bike was the back brake. It wouldn’t adjust correctly and was rubbing against the rim. I took it to a bike shop and was told that the back brake spring was bent and needed to be changed. Unfortunately I was not happy and returned the bike.
3	Loved these shoes until they started getting a hole on the side. I believe it is a design flaw. I haven't had them long and holes have developed where the shoe creases and the fabric meets the plastic lines. I've never had fabric wear out this quickly.
3	Not as comfy as last pair
3	To be honest it’s okay, the hair doesn’t feel like real hair. It gets the job done. But I wish she didn’t have so many bald areas. The head sheds a lot of hair.
3	I'm not too happy about the illumination I'm getting out of this bulb. Bulb has kind of a shadow or streak on it. It does fit though
3	I have an iPhone XS Max holds the phone great. However it doesn’t fit in my vents. The connectors are too short.
3	... has got to be highly overrated. It's a nifty little movie. A bit confusing at times and seems to rely on coincidence because nothing ever appears to be actually engineered by any spirits... The lack of extras and limited sets make this feel like a tv movie... seriously, I'm mostly writing this review because how could this possibly be described as one of the most acclaimed British horror in recent years... totally flummoxed. It's ... average. It's okay. It's nothing especially special.
3	I really liked this raincoat/pancho BUT after 3-4 uses the hole where the collar ring gets attached to the leash is tearing, please talk to the manufacturer to fix problem
3	It was pretty good! The problem I have is I ordered a big size and it was still small can we please get another one if you guys have a larger size than big
3	Kids loved some of the surprises and some not so much. Makes great Easter egg hunt
3	Mine is loud, the cooling is not all that great, and it’s Bulky for my small apartment. The plastic install kit is also very cheap. All in all, seems pretty normal for these overpriced monstrosities. Better than nothing.
3	Very thin uncomfortable material. You definitely need a slip with this.
3	It’s a decent fan but don’t expect this to cool down a room. The ice tray doesn’t come out that far so if you have thick ice cubes you won’t be able to get them in.
3	Not as strong / loud or responsive as I thought it would be. Did not phase the rabbit or chipmunks.
3	I’ve now bought two boxes of these lights but unfortunately only one string has worked in each box. The working ones are fantastic but very disappointed that the other set is not functioning!
3	It's a good read and it helped for a presentation I did at work. I have my core desired feelings figured out.
3	Fun but got tired with it
3	I like it’s lightweight. The head of it swivels too much too easily. Not a great suction. It’s ok for price.
3	Cute book but not loud enough.
3	These were just "okay" kind of thin not really what I had in mind.
3	Not very useful. Well made.
3	My cat did not eat it gave it to birds
3	One of them broke after a few times using it.
3	Nice full coverage mask but difficult to breathe with the mask on especially during the hot summertime. Wish there was a way this mask could be made with two thinner pieces of fabric (outer and liner) so breathing would be a little easier. Or, add one of those plastic gizmos that lets one breathe air easily.
3	This was a gift for my son, the material was a little thinner than I thought it would be
3	Not as funny, and unnecessary bad language. It had the potential to be good though
3	Nothing too exciting here.
3	Very small container
3	A lot bigger then expected. Can’t use it unfortunately.
3	Absolutely stunning piece. Hate that it came with a broken foot!
3	Very pretty, but these earrings are on the heavy side. I can't wear them for long periods of time.
3	Fits an expected, very cute. But it’s Not holding up well. My daughter wore to the beach and this is what it looks like after 2 days. It’s got visible Fuzzies And is fading in the front and bottom. That being said, I still give it a 3 because it’s fully Functional to wear it around the house pool.
3	cannot read from my car
3	The box that the kit came in wasn't taped or glued and the pet cock valve was missing along with a couple of clamps. The hose clamps for the fill hose are to small and are cheap. It would be nice if the quality control was better before shipping.
3	Delivery was very quick, but packaging was very poor. 2 boxes wrapped in plastic that offers no protection from breakage, thrown into a box that is too large, with no protective packaging around it. Surprisingly, all broken pieces were in the same box. Chalk is fragile, and is going to break, but I expect it to be delivered intact, so I can break it myself.

3	I had a feeder previous that held 20 lb. I left it when I moved cross country. This feeder is smaller (that's fine), but the gravity feed part is not what it ought to be. The food doesn't slide down into the bowl/dish from the larger container. My previous one did. This is annoying, and belies the point of the thing. It's convenient to not have to fill the bowl daily, but I'm sad that it doesn't do the one thing that it claims to do - gravity feed.
3	They are very comfortable, but very large, I have asked for a woman's waist and it seems that they sent as men.
3	Unfortunately, not led. Other than that.. OK!
3	Everything is good about it until I tried adjusting the volume control through the keyboard. But I had to first move my mouse and click on the volume control on my computer to show up so I can work it through the keyboard. And no. 5 was for low and 6 was to raise the volume which was not what I expected as a volume control button. Thought there would be one on the top of the keyboard. All in all, I like the lighting and different colors and the keys work fine as well.
3	I returned to this product
3	Huggies are by far my favorite, but for some reason lately the last two boxes I've had a lot of diapers with ripped tabs or they tear off easily while putting on the diaper. The box is definitely more than a months worth for me though, so a few diapers that I cannot use isn't that big of a deal. I'm just not sure if these are in any way different than the Huggies that I might buy at the store.
3	This is pretty rinky dink - made very cheaply and doesn't hold together like expected. Wouldn't recommend or buy again.
3	Did not see any effects at all
3	i have already stitched it together
3	The case is nice, but not sturdy in places. When holding it by the inside handle, it hangs. This will weaken the side edge over time. Also, when the case is open all the way with the cover turned back, there is nowhere for the flaps on the side to go. The company stands by their products and has a great warranty though, so I'm going to keep it and see what happens. Besides, it is a nice looking case!
3	metal slats I'm sure will last longer than canvas, which was on my last swing and was fine, just the vinyl of cushions and canopy had become sun-damaged, BUT when I sit on it I feel them. Cushions are not as dense (same height) seat back is more upright--I want relaxation on my swing. My old cushions actually reversed, these do not. The fabric is higher quality, will probably last longer, canopy almost fits (never did on the old one, and replacement was worse), side tables are a nice feature. I wish I had never bought it, especially since it was so expensive. I paid a handyman $100 to put it together to discover this--would have to pay another $$ to take it apart, cannot return it, stuck with something I don't like.
3	The screen printed part isn’t how I had expected. The NASA is white and not grey as shown. Also the Grey of the sweater is much lighter than the picture shows it being.
3	These are beautiful, but the feathers break and fall off so easily! My kiddo is 6 and these look pretty rugged after she wore them twice.
3	Three of the bulbs are just fine. However, the opening of one of the bulbs is so small that it is very difficult to fill with even a trickle of water.
3	Good quality shirt; however I've only worn it once and the letters started to peel.
3	I’ve not noticed any difference yet but I will keep using this product
3	when i recieved this item, it already had digs and dents about it... the led screen was also shifted a bit... all in all, this item is as shown and also works perfectly.
3	Heaps of typos and muck ups with names and places. I screen shot the mistakes but don’t know who to send them to? I pay for these and think it’s stink there’s so many mistakes
3	Too big and too bulky. It is not comfortable to wear to sleep. During the day is ok.
3	Don't like the fit as well as the authentic. A little narrow
3	Much smaller in person then in photos great if you have very small cats
3	The sights are nice but it didn’t come with an adjustment tool for the front sight..
3	The chair is good quality, however it does not fold up easily or compactly enough to be used everyday on the go.
3	should last more than 15 seconds
3	The part is bigger than the actual OEM relay so you have to either MacGyver on your car or the relay itself to get it to fit. Place I bought from would not respond would not take refund so I was stuck with it
3	The product does not automatically turn on in the dark, a button on the side must be pushed. Not that fun.
3	The lens produces incredibly sharp images with very low distortion as advertised. My main complaint is the amount of flare produced when this lens is used in bright sunlight. I purchased this primarily to use as a landscape lens and had to throw away more than 2/3 of the images i captured with it due to flare and chromatic aberration. If you plan to use this indoors or for astrophotography, you will likely be very pleased. If you intend to use it in bright sunlight, you will likely be very disappointed. For me, it was not a keeper so I returned it.
3	High quality but I didn’t expect I’d need two sets of six to make it around my tree!
3	Broke about a year after purchase. Seller's response to my inquiry is to ask for my order number when it was sent to them. No more response. Stay away
3	It seems sturdy enough and the colors are very visible. But it DOES NOT fit the shure SM58 Wireless Microphones.
3	Arrived on time, and the item was as described. Unfortunately it was broken. Return was easy, though.
3	Worst tasting pill I've ever had, but not the end of the world.
3	Didn’t wear the shoes, read the reviews and the shoes were too big to begin with. Spend money on a nice pair of boots you’ll wear for a long time instead of getting cheap boots.
3	The White looks like an old dinghy tshirt
3	The lamp works and looks good in my room. However, I read reviews that stated it was real natural wood. I received composite wood with laminate finish...not what I was hoping for in the quality. Just another cheap piece of furniture.
3	Does PQQ help with MEMORY PROBLEMS? I purchased it because I read an article that says it does help memory issues. Not one review on here has mentioned any of the sort. Please advise. Thanks
3	The case is a little large around the phone, so my grand daughter will not use it. The case is nice other then the size.
3	Fair kitchen shears. Could be sharper.
3	Way too heavy for my hair. A bit too sticky for me.
3	Cute. Just too small.
3	Usually buy Keen and only Keen, but these broke after the third time wearing these. I'll buy a different kind of Keen.
3	The cream did not effect the pain I bought it for but it relieved some of the arthritis pain in my fingers.
3	Please fix this I just downloaded this and now it tends to crash and then reset which really gets me mad. Please fix this or I will delete it
3	We’ve gone through several of these because eventually the pads shred. Each year they seem a little cheaper and less well built. We have to have a little trampoline for our sensory seeker, but I wish I could find a child sized one that isn’t huge and is better made. I like that this doesn’t use springs.
3	I bought this product because it seemed efficient and because it seemed to be plastic free. It even emphasized it on the packaging saying iron and metal are great. Well guess what ? The powder sits in a non recyclable plastic bag. While it has worked so far on removing stains I’d say it’s disappointing cause Nellie fooled me.
3	Does not hold as much as I was hoping for jury still out on ice melt time
3	I received one of these keyboard silicones in Hebrew and it is pretty good ad does its job. I wish it would actually my MacbookPro 2018 a little better but it works fine. Also, I wish it was a little less "slippery". I mean when I write sometimes the keyboard slips away so every couple of minutes I have to readjust it to my keyboard. But again, solid thing and useful still.
3	These are good for a all over wash so really good for camping or long car rides... good fresh feeling I recomend
3	Made from steel, so this is strong. I only wished that it wouldn’t be to easy to misplace the toothbrushes so they won’t go into the wrong holder.
3	This is a nice heavy duty pasta maker, but I don't have it completely figured out yet. I watched some you tube videos about how to work it, and I will try again. I really want it to work! My star rating may go up once I get it figured out and working correctly.
3	Failed test. I'm very unsatisfied with the service. This made me angry.
3	short in the crotch area
3	Doesn't work as well as advertised, if you follow the instructions on how long your hair should be they're not accurate, if it's that long it doesn't work. It also doesn't heat up evenly and needs to be in the microwave at least 4 minutes before it even begins to soften.
3	These were bigger than I thought they would be. The head is like the size of a dime and they took a long time to receive. But they are cute.
3	After using this product it feels like this product price is on higher side. We can get the same quality in less price
3	Smaller than what expected
3	Definetly not as using adderall, but it gives you a litte boost.
3	Loose fitting but works
3	Cool product but the video seems to lag a little almost making it impossible to fly this fpv. An open space and slow flight is required. There are other products in this category that have better video transmission. I have flown many racing drones and although this is digital and looks clean the lag really makes this just a toy.
3	I really like the IDEA of this item. We have 2 people w ALS and Arthritis using them, and they help w gripping & turning the tops, but on the 16 oz water bottles, they are making them so cheap and "shallow" caps, that this is unable to grip well for that. A coke bottle w a higher cap top works fine. its just the lower profile water bottles they dont work as efficiently. I dont know how durable it it, we just got them. But they are not made of a sturdy plastic like the other gripper items we purchases. But hopefully will work to keep in car, pocket when in need of opening a bottle to drink! MAYBE the company will have to look into re-designing to meet the new low profile caps?
3	I loved my Fitbit but it was not durable at all. I guess they only make them to last a year before they break apart. I've had two of these and they have both fallen apart within a year. That said I do love the app and it's a very accurate step workout tracker. They just aren't built to last. Corporate greed. Tut tut
3	Love tablet but battery life is a big disappointment. That's the biggest reason for my upgrade.
3	I tested the Grab Bar by attaching it to an office desk and lifting it up. The suction was great and I was able to lift the table several times. Afterwards, I installed it on large tiles on the wall outside of the bathtub. I grabbed it and yanked down on it and it held fine. I released the suction and re-engaged it again just in case. Five hours later, the bar was in the bathtub. I think if the bar is re-installed each time you want to use it, it's a fine product. However, if you meant to install it and leave it there for a long time, it might not be what you're looking for.
3	While a nice gift, this is quiet overpriced for its tiny size.
3	TO HARD TO TOUCH THE KEYBOARD N HARD TO GET THE PEN OUT
3	Is a nice looking wallet, but I found someone else’s personal stuff in it. Threw it away and will use the wallet anyway
3	Died in 5months. Get the replacement
3	I purchased this cologne for my baby girl that’s months old. This is a new scent that I was trying due to the stores not having the mild cologne in stores. I like it but it’s a bit strong compared to the Johnsons mild baby cologne. Good scent overall just strong for a baby.
3	Fits great, but it would've been better if the material is water resistant and easier to clean.
3	hard to get and the price shows it. Product is great... not sure what is wrong at royal Canin
3	The case that it came with was not made for these specific tools so they are loose in the box. Otherwise the tools work just fine.
3	My 3 year old gets bored with these stories. Disappointed in how difficult the stories are for her to understand. Was hoping they'd be a little more geared toward kids.
3	I guess I'm just a newbie but I didn't know I was supposed to purchase other items in order to use this polisher. Frankly, I have no idea what I'm supposed to get and this unit is very expensive. Sigh...
3	Very soft material, very comfortable, but it seems to be a bit low quality. the seams near the interface of the sheer and the black show.
3	I would've been 90% pleased with this purchase had my order not been damaged when I got it. It's exactly what I needed other than that. It was somewhat easy to put together and the quality is pretty good.
3	Fits a lil large have to wait til she’s legit 3 months to wear it. They sent me the wrong romper also, I received the hot pink floral one. But it’s still really cute so I didn’t return it. The bow is entirely too big I’ll have to cut and sew it some to make it fit on her. Overall not bad but definitely could have been better.
3	The zipper gets stuck constantly when I try to close it. Otherwise it's decent
3	good, but the handles have a tendency to bend
3	Cover is very sturdy. Unfortunately I didn’t realize the pages would have designs. I prefer ruled but no designs. The description said “full color exterior and interior,” and the pages are slightly tinted. If that phrase was supposed to clue me in to the fact there would also be leaves and butterflies on each page, it didn’t. A photo of the interior should have been included. See mine.
3	Leaves a weird grainy residue
3	Look more like a lotion
3	come off too easy not very excited about these
3	I liked the story line. I didn't like reading the same information over and over. Also I didn't like the ending.
3	I ordered two packs of these as a gag gift for a friend. A month later a third package somehow showed up at my parent's house stowed away in one of their other orders. Well played, Amazon.
3	The chairs looks great and are comfortable, but after 4 months of minimal use they are starting to split along the grain. See pic.
3	The phone is okay, just have issues with camera. Won't open up most of the time,when it does it's my face is upside down so annoying.
4	Love the power of the machine, the weight and the longer cord. Suction is great for dog hair and dirt on bare floors. Crevasse tool is great for getting into small spaces. I have 2 older models ( 20 years ) that are heavier and still working. Hope this newer version lasts as long. Slight problem is the shorter dog hair sticks out of the cloth bag and is harder to clean out. I like the cloth bag because it is more environmentally friendly,
4	They fit, but are flimsy
4	They are smaller than I thought they would be, but this is only my first time buying boxes. I got the 2" x 3" x 4" ones. They're a bit hard to assemble but I'm learning. Great for smaller packages and parts.
4	Feels almost like a light jacket, it'll make you sweaty. The Radio clip loop is a nice thing to have
4	So nice...I bought it twice! One for me and one for my sister! Heats and froths perfectly. Easy to clean. Prompt shipping from vendor. Packaged well.
4	super cute and adjustable. now to see if they will hold up and work well in montana.
4	These bags are really nice if you’re trying to reduce your plastic use or you just want a reusable alternative to ziplock bags. These have a closure similar to a ziplock back but their material is better and washes well. My only complaints are that they are not dishwasher safe and the openings aren’t super wide.
4	I received a slightly tilted item. I thought this is how it was designed. It was better to hold like that as well, but later I saw that the main shaft is bent/damaged, and that's why there was the tilt. Also the material of the umbrella is not the best one. It should be water repellent or resistant, but it seemed like it was getting wet.
4	Nice product, nice price. We will use them for craft projects.
4	This product is very hard and must swirl my fingers to warm up and use. Wasn’t sure what to expect, still what I believe I need for lips, cuticles . No aroma that is bothersome
4	The pocket should be centered more towards the middle.
4	This air purifier works well. It circulates the air in our bedroom at low speed without much noise. It is small and lightweight making it easy to move from room to room when necessary. We are happy with our purchase.
4	Good set for the price
4	It is good for the price, but not the best quality. you get what you pay for
4	It’s a little uneven which is fine while it’s on carpet but not on firm surfaces. Although it was super simple to put together.
4	Not to bad . Very bright headlights
4	Very good grip on the ears. Prevented my glasses from sliding down my nose. Multiple colors at one price.
4	They smell weird but good quality. Does not break down easily.
4	I liked the curtains very much. Material and craftsmanship was very nice. However, the color and style of the curtians I chose did not work very well with the window and room. So, I returned them. Otherwise, I would have used them.
4	Great case i recommend getting a gorilla glass cover as well, the fabric however gets reflective as it collects dirt and dust.
4	This looks just as pictured, very cute design and very spacious. The only problem I had was the straps kept coming off but once I tightened them they’re good to go!
4	Happy with what I got
4	Very nice for the price. I have been fishing with them and they swim alright. A few don't swim well but overall they work. Still haven't caught a fish with them.
4	It's hard to use. It doesn't remember after you turn it off. Each time I turn it on I have to set it again. But it looks good. It takes a minute to get warm and the fan doesn't blow that hard. But still for the price I think it's fine.
4	So far so good. Very reasonable price and I’m happy to have a band with a buckle rather than the original stupid clasp thing that wore out quickly and kept detaching. I’m a big guy and would’ve preferred a slightly longer band but it seems to be staying on.... otherwise would give 5 stars.
4	Nice size for the back of a full sized crew cab pickup. I like the cover design. Can Holds alot. Weak magnet so much so you can't feel it grabbing at all when you open the lid. I'll probably fix the lid with either a stronger magnetic or velcro.
4	My friend who I had Amazon send it to said it was pretty with beautiful colors.
4	The product seems good fabric, but the delivery took so much longer. It didn't fit me well, was too large. But I'll use it to sleep, so it's not that problem.
4	Feel better having it
4	This is a gift so it has not been used. However it is a good quality tool, metal not plastic, and I will be happy to give it.
4	My first order was returned due to package damage. Then my second order came without bolts and clip, this is why I gave it 2 stars for installation. Would have been nice to get what I paid for.
4	Very clever perspective, enjoyed learning new vocabulary words...definitely fun!
4	Love this. Not your normal plain tiles. Better than I expected. Only thing I didn’t love was the pushers. They are a little awkward but the beautiful tiles and case make up for that.
4	Great fan but don't expect 'cold' air. The air is cool but not cold. It does the job well enough to justify not buying an AC, but if you need real cooling power, get an AC as this fan just blows somewhat cool air. But nonetheless great fan. Only issue is that it is a bit wobbly on the stand but if you're not clumsy you won't knock it over.
4	Tastes like green tea for sure. I like it!
4	If you like Mr. Rogers it is a nice book of his lyrics. The illustrations are also nice.
4	Great for behind the fridge filtering. Metal strap needed to attached to wall.
4	Very nice, soft leggings in exactly the color I wanted...only 4 stars ‘cause even though the fabric is not see through, it’s fairly thin and only good for layering in very cold weather.
4	So I read all the reviews so far so good. It is loud and the chain but I prefer the noise over a cord that stretches out over time. I would at this point recommend it to others. I just need to check with my neighbor underneath me does he hear it I don't think so but my entire neighborhood is super quiet. Outside of that its great of course I wish there was more resistance but i'm going to buy wrist weights so boom arms good and I'm going to buy the plastic workout suit so I can really really sweat. But as a person who is Obese and has osteoarthritis in both knees this is a must have.
4	It's soft and very comfortable. I didn't read the description well enough to see there is glitter on the shirt and it's a printed graphic not actual lace.
4	it was fairly comfortable. worth purchase ....
4	It fits well for post partum belly
4	I had some small furniture products I needed a clean cutting saw for and this one was recommended by a couple of woodworking websites. It took a little getting used to the pull action as opposed to the push cut like on an American saw, but I can say that it does cut quicker and more smoothly once you get the hang of it. The edges are much less rough at the end of the cut too. I docked one star because the saw is a little too flexible for harder woods, but it still is a great saw.
4	Great so far except it’s for a 12 year old and all the packaging is not English, I can see having it in multiple languages.
4	nice look, but a bit big
4	Looks to be great fun.
4	This was a good, straightforward book on what is written in Revelation. Would have given 5 stars, but verbose at times.
4	Holy crap this will go SUCH a long way. BE AWARE: this black is a blue-base (maybe even slightly green) and didn't end up matching the true black leather that I had.
4	Presumably it takes a couple of weeks for the skin to peel off after you use this exfoliating mask, so I don't know if it actually works. It does, however, smell good and makes your feet soft.
4	Our son loves this. It’s much smaller than I expected, and it looks pretty fragile. But so far, so good.
4	A nice pen, very solid. Combined it with a Zebra 401 and Fisher space pen to make an awesome pen.
4	Was looking to make my shower look more organized. Perfect size and color for my modern shower. Unfortunately the water will accumulate since they didnt put enough holes for the water to flush out. I modified it with my drill and put holes all over the bottom now I dont have a mildew build up.
4	Excellent depiction of the aftereffects of WW-II in a particular community.
4	Pay close attention: you only get one (random) color glitter. I wish there were more pipettes, I use a lot of those. Also, wish there were double if the smaller tiny molds (like the cat shape) for things like earrings. The ring mold is really too small for me (and most people I know) but my kid likes playing with the one and only ring I made. The bangle mold won’t go over my wrist (the product it makes won’t) but I mostly use it to set extra resin. Glitter sticks to it like CRAZY but glitter sticks to everything. Hard to clean off. It’s also difficult to remove anything from the taller skinny molds but still good for the price.
4	An old favorite I never tire of... even though it does feel like it should have been a full-on novel. I love all the movie versions as well. The language is kinda antiquated and will surely put off some readers, but it's full of all kinds of vivid descriptions and fascinating ideas about our possible future that still hold relevance today. The template is timeless and I can see this one being retold over and over with random variations for years to come...
4	Good size and cute but chemical smell, had to put it outside for a day it was so strong.
4	The belts are actually a brilliant idea. Not a 5 because the buckle is not as nice as others I've seen.
4	Good for the price nice clarity
4	I got this solar ground light to put in my garden. I think having a garden that have lights along the pathway is very nice, it makes the garden beautiful. I decided to test these and they work well. The brightness of the lights is just right for my garden, it is easy to install and gets solar power easily too
4	Nice organizer. Wish the binding was a bit more flexible.
4	These work fine, containing the smell well. But they are pricey. In the end, we'll buy them.
4	Great bag works well plenty of storage
4	These speakers are working out well for my computer. I listened to music while I work, and I am very satisfied with the sound.
4	Great product! Hate the Basil. Reordered in Lavendar
4	So cute! Bought a large as a gift for my mother-in-law, and she loved it. Only problem: I ordered a large and it looks like a medium. Hopefully it fits her and doesn't shrink.
4	Looks great but the only problem was the tape that was applied onto it already. It was set too low and it would be exposed when I installed the visors. So then I had to take the tape off and reapply a new one on each visor. Other than that it’s been serving its purpose.
4	Cute story. Cutest illustrations. Way too many words for a board book.
4	I really like this, it feels great, I just wish the handles pulled out and were a bit longer, I have to use sideways for my back.
4	Decent product! Made floating in pool easy!
4	My item came with a broken button, I immediately told them, I had a new purse the next day.
4	Good price I like the design. I also bought a rose gold and prefer that color.
4	looks good with my jeans. very satisfied
4	It works well. I wish it lasted longer but it is what it is.
4	We really like it. But, Not excellent for chunky smoothies if you leave the spillproof insert in. Our 1.5 yr old can't squeeze all the food up on her own without the insert, which creates a vaccuum. Also the silicone attracts dog hair. Not sure there is anything better, so we are pretty happy with this.
4	Uhhh, this thing is very powerful...LOL- works great..just be careful, 2 speeds and both are well enough!
4	Not changing phones often, this has been the best case! I tend to keep phones for 2-3 years, if they don't shatter. The back of the case seems to stay crystal clear so far. The fingerprint reader doesn't have great access if I place my thumb on it at an angle, or don't press in fully. My phone has been dropped a number of times, and still looks perfect. Would definitely go with this brand again.
4	I really like this translation and the accompanying study guides. The quality of this specific product is excellent as well. However, I had to return it because the print was just too small for my 70 year old eyes to read easily, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
4	Good purchase. My only complaint is that you can’t adjust the collar stay very easily as I thought. It takes some time getting used to but all in all good purchase. I like how the item can fit all the collar stay sizes.
4	Fantastic bracelet; very pleased with this purchase.
4	Nothing is perfect. It works well for the money. Drops a call every now and then when answer to talk. No big deal.
4	The cutout doesn't fit the screen perfectly, but that's OK. The protector installed easily with no bubbles. Peace of mind.
4	Really good flavor, smaller bags then other brands tho,
4	Good product, nice big sized cups. I make myself ice coffee for daily commute and these are perfect. I took off one star because the cups have some plastic smell to them.
4	Looks great, a bit pricey, should do the job when we need it to get to the sun.
4	They worked well for our trip and seemed to save space. Held up well.
4	They fit as hoped for and are very comfortable, walked 2.5 miles the first time I wore them. They are rather light weight compared with older Docs I have so will have to see how they wear.
4	A fantastically cheesy B movie. Its worth the watch :)
4	Little on the small end. Wish there were dampeners to quiet it a bit more but other than those two things I love it and got it at an amazing price during black Friday.
4	Granddaughter loves it.
4	So far so good. Looks like QC wasn't too concerned with looks because there was some painted touch-ups on the rubber portions around the side of the show, but since this is a work shoe, I'm not too concerned about it either. I normally wear a US size 10.5 so I got the 11 which fits very well. Will update once I get idea of how they hold up.
4	I've had a bit of time to use the knife and run it through it's regular use and so far it's holding up. From the stock image, it appears kind of cheap and almost plastic looking, but I assure you that it is very sturdy. Almost 0 flex when the blade is out as well. The paint on the thumb release is starting to fade and chip a little bit but it's purely cosmetic. For the price, I don't think you can get much better in the spring assisted OTF world. Really liking the handgun style safety so you don't accidentally deploy the knife in your pocket. Side note: check your state laws before you buy. It is spring assisted and not automatic.
4	Nice pants but, way to be big!!
4	My 8 month old granddaughter likes it but problem is she was zooming in walker first so she gets frustrated when she can’t follow us. The other one was dangerous and this is great!! My advice is to introduce baby’s to this one first and the baby will love it.
4	Should work well for anyone with fine line marker needs...Price is good, too! Take Care!
4	I enjoyed the game but I didn't like how it had only one camera view. And when I first get on the game it's very slow.
4	This product is decent, the internal timer doesn't last from year to year and usually just ends up staying on 100% of the time. It looks great in the window, and produces a nice bright light.
4	I love it I wanted a case that showed off my phone. But I gave it a 4 star because though it had great slip resistant on the sides, top and bottom... the backside can be very slippery but only if your one to be clumsy with your phone a lot. Other than that I absolutely love the case so far... but I’ve only had it a few days ... sorry no photo as I’m using the phone may update later
4	I do recommend this for beginners but if you play at a more advanced level I recommend you goto a professional instrument shop to get a better mute. Oh well, you get what you paid for.
4	Loved this book. Extremely useful for helping children learn how to deal with their anger. I have one complaint: most modern psychologists agree, children should not be left to deal with their anger alone. I would've preferred a story where the adult stayed with the child and their feelings. That's a relatively minor quibble as the story overall is an excellent way to help a child identify and process their feelings.
4	250lbs of human in the chair has ripped the inside seam (where the seat and side wall come together). On both chairs. Otherwise, these are completely awesome chairs! I have repaired the rips, and just ask heavier folks to bring their own chairs, or use chairs that are already provided at the campsite (like where we are staying currently).
4	Bravo, this purchase was a win for sure. Usually I'm a subscriber to "you get what you pay for" but in this instance you get more. I have a 17in MSI Gaming laptop that I bought this for. This desk handles it with ease. It is really adjustable and easy to use. This is the first Chinese made product win for me. I have used it all day today gaming, surfing and as a text book holder while I wrote a paper. Pros: Light, sturdy, metal components, quiet USB fan, adjustable Cons: Fit and finish could be better ( great for the price, I would pay more for better)
4	It works fine but I do feel like they bunch a bit in the back.
4	How I couldn't solve the mystery until it was revealed. It had my attention through out the whole story.
4	It helped cover our two leather rocker chairs from continuing to peel near headrests & leaving residue.
4	Compact container and many sizes.. Perfect for camping!! Thank you!
4	these were great but the Velcro did not last as long as i thought they would. they have already come apart so i can't really Velcro them on anymore
4	You must mount these in the short round switch holders to mount in a lighter style hole. The long switch holders do not have anything for the switch locks to grab. The switch will fall out of the long adapter. Mount switch without holder in a 3/4" Hole for a cleaner look
4	(All stickers were included except the Tokyo Ghoul one) Good variety of stickers! I’d say I liked about half from the entire lot but that’s just based on my preference. The others were still really good but didn’t really appeal to me. They aren’t a pain to peel off as well. If you’re looking to decorate anything I’d definitely recommend!
4	Nice big banner but the Pom poms were a pain to puff up and put together.
4	Love it! Everyone at the office loves it too.
4	Slightly higher amp capacity than my old battery and it added speed and longevity to my tools. I recommended them to my son when he needs replacement batteries.
4	Gold confetti is a little hard to see and make the ballon hang funny.
4	This is a great tablet mount, however my only complaint is, I wish the bottom surface area was larger(the area where the 1/4-20 connects). If it was larger it would create more friction. Since this area is small you really have to crank it down tight to keep from moving. With that said, It's almost perfect. Its sturdy and extremely light weight. Much better than the cheap spring type clamps.
4	Colors names difficult to read even w/glasses. Shiny. Just saying...
4	I really enjoyed it! Classic James Patterson with easy to read chapters and a quick plot. Definitely one not to miss
4	This is a lovely little dish that I will enjoy using. It would make a nice gift. My only problem with it is the knob to the lid is tapered and so smooth it's difficult to open. I have to use 4 fingers or 2 hands. I suspect the lid might get broken quite easily if someone's fingers are very dry. That part is a shame because it really is a beautiful little dish appropriate for candy or nuts.
4	I really liked the look of these denim looking blue jean leggings. They are very comfortable too. The only suggestion is put a little tummy control at the top. Even without the tummy control of other leggings I have, I ordered a pair of these leggings in black and they are just as nice.
4	Not super stable, but works fine for what it is. Biggest thing is that it does work with the older model grills. I don’t understand why the box says it wouldn’t fit.
4	These or ok. Got these to try out as a test. Does very well
4	Great vitamin pack but I think there are too many to take at once. When I separated them out throughout the day I didn't the same effect.
4	Okay soooo I finally decided to use the mask. 1st let me say that it works very well leaves your face feeling very clean and refreshed...Downside if you up for some pain then this will give you some.. The removal of mask was a bit painful and it did make me upset that it caused me But all an all it does work . I recommend that you use for blackhead area only like the nose area aand not whole face
4	I love this bathing suit! Only issue is that the bottoms are somewhat sheer out of the water, but otherwise I like this!
4	What can I say? It's a calendar. Larger than expected with large date squares that I can write in. Cute pictures of my favorite dog the Papillon.
4	Perfect size for my needs. Isn't too loud.
4	Size is a little off I should of got a small if your 30-32 get a small
4	Well built product, for the most part. The bottom flap was sewn too small to fit the bottom strap, I ended up cutting it a little bit to fit. Happy with it for the price.
4	So far so good. Charges fast. Works well.
4	Very sturdy Only issues I had were the brass mounting screws. The do snap so I replaced them with sturdy screws. Not a deal breaker at all. I also took a drop of ca glue and glued the round risers onto the main bar. Huge time saver if you are installing solo. It holds the risers in place while you attach the shelf.
4	The author helps us get to know the combatants in detail. Many archival pictures support the action. The various weapons utilized are discussed for effectiveness. Soldier's wounds and casualties are discussed in enough detail to give more depth to the human toll. It is nice to find out more about the careers and activities of many of the survivors after the war.
4	Great filter. But don’t order from the U.S. if you’re in a hurry. Takes about a month to ship from China.
4	I love these glasses. Very good quality and they look great on me. I'm happy.
4	not exactly as pictured with white Kirby Logo, mine arrived a yellow color. not sure of difference but belt worked fine
4	This was basically exactly what I wanted. They are high quality and function how I would expect. Nice mix of classic look and features. The little tag to show what club the sock is intended for is perfect.
4	Pretty easy to use even for someone with larger hands i like the size of the blades too
4	I bought this Beyblade I loved it it worked amazingly but sadly the next day the face bolt or screw if you want to call it broke, so if you buy this product I would have an extra Face bolt.
4	Very fun card draft game with a cool theme.
4	Wood pieces are good, would suggest longer boards. Plastic piece should be more sturdy. It took my cat several days then she starting to lay on it.
4	Love the shirt! My only complaint is that I wish the arms were a bit longer. I should mention that have very long arms and this is my usual complaint.
4	I just completed my first canister. It lasted me daily use from June 16 - July 25. The taste I actually like! I’m not sure how long until you start to notice changes in how you feel or your skin or anything, but so far it’s a no go in that area
4	Works well for cutting cilantro and other small items.
4	Beautiful wallet 1 row of card slots very hard to get one in. Will not be able to put 2 in. But will hold all securely. Wonderful quality leather. Design was exactly what I was looking for.
4	Love the hat but they do not leave much room for adjustment if you have a larger head! Will have to replace the velcro on the back to make it fit better.
4	Decent story, but I had a hard time connecting with the characters and buying into some of their choices.
4	Made a live well for sardines and anchovies for pier / shore fishing. Ice chest + this kit + 12v marine battery kept my bait alive until i ran out. Remember to throw a 5 gallon bucket of ocean water in every half hour or so and you'll be fine. Slits in the PVC (water outlet) were a little narrow and had a tendency to clog with fish scales if i didn't clear them, so i opened up the holes a bit. Over all, not a bad buy; the other components were much more expensive, but this seems to hold up as long as you flush the pump when you get home.
4	Just got my joggers, style is great and fit. I can work out in them and style around in them as wearing them as casual wear. As someone who works out comfort and style is a must, not to mention a good price point. I just found my perfect athletic wear from top to bottom. I plan on getting the matching jacket next. I highly recommend their wears to any guy (thumbs up!).
4	works better than the mic that came with my karaoke machine. makes good sound.
4	Super cute luxury dupe that is so functional! The only reason that it's four stars is due to the zipper, which sticks occasionally and seems to be lower quality than the zipper on the Daisy Rose wallet and the tote. Otherwise an awesome purchase.
4	Another great read. Just love S.Eddie's books. Love Silas and Jasmine and their family. Chimera is great also. You will not be disappointed.
4	Think the space is great and it is very streamlined. The latches are a little difficult to use at times. Used to carry stiff while moving cross country.
4	It was what I needed at a good price.
4	Very informative! Excellent resource!
4	The product was bought to fix a child’s motorized car. It was installed easily and seems to be holding up.
4	Super cute dress! I absolutely loved it, fit as it should. My only complaint is the material, it's a fuzzy spandex body suit, it's a hot box! If you're body temperature is higher in your pregnancy, purchase at your own risk. I'm not generally a warm person and I sweat through this dress in an hour.
4	Good cam, does why it’s supposed to do. I did have a problem after tweaking settings using IP address that the secondary guided setup would register spaces in my WiFi network name as a “+” , which I assumed was just symbolic to Foscam recognizing the space. I’d finish and notice my camera couldn’t get back online. After running setups a 4th time and working with Zion from their excellent responsive customer support, I figured out the + was being added and changing the network name. I removed the + and it worked great consistently! I’ll buy more!
4	I purchased two of them, they have a nice feel, nice size. Its about the length of your palm. Can get noisy when the settings are turned up but I like it, the only thing I dislike is that I have to keep clicking through every setting to turn it off.
4	A lot of shedding but it held up after several shampoos for about 10 weeks.
4	Folds out nicely. Full shape. Very nice
4	This burns through batteries quickly, b it it IS worth it! My son has hours of fun !
4	I purchased them for my husband because he was complaining of heel pain when exercises and want not too tight socks around the ankle. They came earlier than what they state. They are made of nice material that make soft compression on on your heels and not too tight. They mentioned it should be hand wash but I washed them many many time in gentle cycle and yep they still doing the same work. I just wish if they could make it with other different colors to match out fit. I made another purchase but for me this time. I like to wear them when I work at home as well at the park when I go to play with my kids
4	I am a musician and a subway commuter. I bought these earplugs for reading on the train and long evenings at rehearsal. I find that they are among the best earplugs I have tried in terms of fidelity. They cut volume down to a comfortable level for extended exposure while still letting enough mid and high frequencies through that I can understand what I am hearing. They wouldn't be great for total sound blockage, but they're very nice for reducing ear fatigue in loud environments. Unfortunately, they are also rather small and easy to lose, especially since they're clear. The canister that they come in is a bit narrow, and it can be hard to fish the plugs out. Sometimes I use a car key, and I worry that it may look like I am about to perform some sort of illicit sniffing activity. This whole ordeal also led to me losing one of the plugs within a week or two of getting them-- it got dropped on the floor of a dark club while I was trying to fish it out of its canister. Whoops. They're also potentially easy to lose in your ear canal-- I find that the stems are a bit short, and I sometimes feel like I'm one misstep away from a very sticky situation. On the upside, this also means that they're Very Discrete! You will not look like a nerd as one does when they wear bright orange foam earplugs.
4	Good tight fit, well made. Come in handy for several uses especially wall wart adapters.
4	Fits as expected, but rides up sometimes which is annoying. Fabric quality as expected.
4	Does as described. Pedometer accurate and heart rate pretty close. Battery about 2 days. 2 weeks in and still doing okay. The phone app could use some improvements.
4	Works great, wish the buttons were raised a bit so you could find them in the dark! Overall a good c vibe.
4	I bought this awhile back. This mattress is quite firm so if you aren't looking for that, I would probably avoid this mattress. It expanded just as expected and was definitely a great mattress considering how cheap it was.
4	Looks great, gave it a 4 no instructions for pulley and light.
4	Sherry Lansing is one of the last great Hollywood producers. Rising up through the ranks, from actress to script reader to head of Paramount pictures, her career spans the time when Hollywood went from stodgy and insular to wild and brash and into corporate-run risk-averse number counters. Through her time in charge, she led projects near to her, stepped down on her own terms, and led a life of philanthropy. Definitely worth the read.
4	This shoe is a little flimsy but it still does the job, and they’re still cute.
4	Product arrived in a timely manner. I've used it right away, and two of the fairy beasts have been caught and disposed of. I like this product.
4	This pillow cover is very cute and well made. My only complaint is that the material is very thin. It will be perfect for what I ordered it for.
4	Beautiful color and very soft! Even gave it 4 stars. I absolutely loved this wig but I had to return it because the cut is too choppy in the back.
4	Mine required very easy assembly but didn't come with lid (also had previous customers return label inside package) but that's okay I bought a lid and I am not going to send it back. Works great for pouring honey into small jars.
4	Absolutely love the sign. However the package is supposed to come with suction cups and mine did not. It’s a simple thing to replace but I did spend a little extra so I would expect to get what I paid for.
4	This is a nice set for the price. I bought it for our guest room. I marked it down one star because the 2 little decorative pillows were squished when they arrived and despite attempts to fluff them up, they look too flat.
4	Great size. Durable and easy to clean. Fits in the kitchen without taking up a lot of space. I just wish it came with a lid.
4	I thought I ordered Super Shape, not Super Shape Extreme.
4	4 of my rocks were duds. They were completely solid and no crystals. But the rest were great super pretty. Not big so if your wanting a bigger geode I wouldnt buy this box. There was only 2 medium sized ones in mine and those happened to be the best so the bigger the rock the better the Crystal's.
4	I like the pink color, but it’s not as bright as the red collar. It has two settings: solid and blinking. I haven’t had to recharge it or change batteries yet. (I can’t even remember what method is used to recharge.) We go on a 20-30 minute walk every night in the dark, and we’ve been using this collar for about 3 or 4 months. The collar is very long and can be cut to the right size needed. I cut it so that it is just long enough to where I can easily slip it on and off my pup’s head when needed. I never use the actual fastener.
4	This book is exceptionally useful in dealing with your life. Following this book, you can undoubtedly see how to sort out your life. Particularly this book will assist me with managing profoundly. I profoundly suggest this book.I highly recommend.
4	It is definitely bigger and not an organic feeling then holding it, but its east to control and the light works great. Mine did not come with bags but the holder was included.
4	Looks good but sits high and I had to adjust my hood latch. Wish it would sit at the same height of the stock grill it would get 5 stars.
4	Sheets are soft as hell, there was a pulled thread on one side(pic) super small and not really noticeable but it sucks that it’s defective on delivery. Not going to stop me from sleeping on them though.
4	munchkins plus castle panic equals how can you go wrong
4	Great little device to have for adding some bling to dishes. Again like most items today will the device stand the test of time. Have only used it once so far. Hope to get more use out of it in the future.
4	I'm still pregnant with my baby girl. But the onesie looks just as its pictured online and the fabric is very soft and silky. I'm just a little upset that the head band is a sort of DIY thing. I guess I have to learn to tie a bow lol. Other than that it's perfect and I can't wait to see my little girl wear it.
4	It was surprisingly hard for my to find slippers that fit on like a shoe, so when I found these I was excited! They cute, unique, and rather comfortable to wear. They keep my feet warm without making them sweaty (which is always a plus!). Lots of people have seen me wearing them and have complimented on how cute they are and asked where I got them. XD
4	My dog enjoys this food and can be a picky eater. I will be trying different flavors of the same Blue Basics Limited Ingredient line of dry food.
4	I really like it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was due to the lousy tool that was provided to remove excess links. It worked to remove 1 rod but it broke trying to remove the 2nd rod. I ended up having to go to a jeweler to get the job done. My jeweler was very gracious and did not charge me but others may not be so fortunate.
4	Its working but I cant get setup menu button to work
4	Deadly Partnership hooked me with the first chapter. Who was the mysterious killer? Roland was a smug SOB, but what did he do to deserve being buried alive? Did poor Wendy survive? How did this all tie in with Paul? The only question not answered concerned Wendy, but considering Paul wasn't totally unscrupulous I suppose she was safe after she did what he asked. Other than his wife dying, Paul Jenkins seemingly had a perfect life up till his retirement. Even his plans to move in with his sister Julie in their childhood home in the place they grew up seemed set to be a bed of roses. He forgot about the thorns. Everything went perfectly -- reconnecting with his sister, son, old friends, old flame, remodeling the house -- until the night a burglar broke in. Death intrudes several times, or should I say gets invited in? Julie's away on vacation, so she has no idea what nefarious schemes her brother carried out until she comes home and gets a ghost of an idea. There were times I almost despised Paul, but in the end he did prove that he could still put a few other people before himself. Richard Gardner found me on Goodreads and offered me a chance to read a PDF of his book for a review because he saw that paranormal was one of my favorite genres. How he found me among countless members is beyond me, but I'm very glad he did. I enjoyed reading Deadly Partnership very much and look forward to reading more by him.
4	Keep all of my important papers inside it
4	I love the glitter in this case!! At times, it may seem like a bit much (it sometimes gets pooled in a corner and has a hard time getting free), but it's very fun! One downside I've noticed with this case is that the hole for the headphone jack doesn't exactly line up, so a little finagling may be needed to plug it in.
4	Great intro to the older kids version. Not as sturdy and my 4 yo can't set it up by himself but he enjoys it.
4	Product works for the item listed which is nice. The charger end must be inserted at just the right angle for the shaver to receive it, wish it was a bit easier. Outside of the slightly awkward fitment, product seems solid.
4	This hand exerciser is just what I needed since slightly injuring the muscles in my hand . Just by squeezing the metal coil I can feel it helping to flex that muscle. It's like instant therapy.
4	Smaller than I expected but looks to be okay quality for the price. I would not put a lot of pressure on the peg remover as it doesn't appear to be very strong. A good value though.
4	The Chair is more like a green/dark grey color. Different from the photo (medium grey) . For my little space works fine. Read the measurements before, is very small.
4	Nice book but definitely for a more mature reader than I was anticipating
4	Love it, and it's so beautiful. But didn't give 5 stars because the seem could be neater. I'm hoping that it will hold up to repeated usage.
4	I wanted something for everyday n this is perfect..
4	Not sure about the protection aspect yet! Came on time and fit the phone!
4	Cute suit! Love the ruffle and when it goes up while swimming you still have coverage from the high waisted bottom. Ordered a second one in a different color combo
4	Great product! The case itself scratches easily though. Everything else seems to work just fine
4	these are really soft and comfortable but I think they run a little big
4	This stamp isn’t very beginner friendly, but I also think that it’s probably the same for all nail stamps. It took a while for me to figure out how to get the polish to stick to the stamp. But after many practice rounds (and YouTube videos) I figured it out! I love the wide selection of templates. Once you get the hang of it, it’s fun to design your own nails!
4	very nice pillows for decorative covers, but not quite as full as I would like.
4	Meets my basic need.
4	Great sturdy cable! Looks long lasting. I just hope they are all 3 feet long. Since the longer one charges slower. The 3 feet works great
4	Did not like how my package was handled
4	Nice umbrella for the money. Thin lightweight fabric that I hope holds up thru many summers. So far so good. Love the Lime Green.
4	Great chew toy and not as easy to destruct, although my Parsons Jack Russell is pretty good at demolishing toys. He has chewed the edges off already and there are little bits of rubber laying all over, but it lasts longer than other toys. All in all some of his favorite toys
4	They are very thin, but if you're just trying to root out some starts for a few weeks, it's good enough for that.
4	I haven't been able to use it tracking a critter yet. I have tested it in various "simulations" to ensure it will help me. I got it because I'm red/green color blind so I sometimes struggle picking up blood on it's own which is frustrating. I do feel this will help me greatly after testing it out. The strength of the light and overall build quality is excellent. I now keep it in my hunting pack at all times to help when the moment comes.
4	I bought 3- one each for fridge and 2 freezers. When they tip over they spill. Would give 5 stars if had mesh covering to prevent spillage. I made my own with a few layers of cheesecloth over the holes.
4	Bought this and gifted to a friend. This stuff is amazing. She's been getting eyelash extensions for years but The cost of those extensions were too expensive. So I bought this stuff Because she mentioned about this type of product. She was thrilled to get the serum. She loves this so much and I'm glad I got this.
4	Works well. Nice color. Don't use it as much as I thought I would.
4	Very basic cheap sleeve. it will keep scuffs to a minimum.
4	I'm buying another, because the one I bought in April of 2017 is finally coming apart. Value, you bet. I put 40,000 miles on my car every year, and if I rent a car I take it with me. Easy install? Eh, I drive an SUV so I've grown accustomed to adjusting it when it needs it.
4	Everything they said it would be. Some were better than others but overall they all were good.
4	Absolutely love the crackers the flavor if you’re doing low-carb I give them a thumbs up. The downside is they are very costly for a cracker and I wish I could buy them somewhere and not have them shipped because they arrive mostly broken up. I had a hard time finding one whole cracker in the bay
4	Flash/light does not work
4	.Good quality we're definitely buy from the seller I received it very quickly I would definitely order again from this company
4	Like the look and initial quality of this product.
4	This would have 5 stars but it cut my internet speed in half, 200 Mbps down to 91 Mbps. Other than that an awesome product.
4	If you just need to consume some calories and protein, this works. It definitely doesn't taste amazing or even remotely natural, and it's a bit on the thick side, but for convenience it's completely fine and the after taste dissipates pretty quickly. Tastes a bit like cheap chocolate with sweetener but as I said, the taste fades fast.
4	Husband loves them they are very nice and sturdy
4	Very comfortable and sturdy. Great amount of compression!
4	can't answer the durability question just go the product.
4	Nice beginner guitar for the price.
4	It took a long time to wait. I planted them and really want beauty to grow.
4	Ours broke and we needed a replacement. I found this one and it worked perfectly. Its now 5 months later and the down and back keys aren't working as well. (Probably cause its one of the most used keys.) I'm very satisfied with the price to value so I will be buying another.
4	I really liked this film! I think the casting was key... the Actor who played Jovan had me engaged from the start with his moral dilemma. Overall, the acting was well done, the production quality was consistent and well executed and the storyline was fresh but with twists. You can tell the director spent a lot of time making each shot the best it could be. Great job by all involved.
4	I literally put this out there 5 minutes ago immediately after the postman left and it seems to work. My water bath is ridged at the bottom so unfortunately the suctions won’t work but that’s not a fault of the pump. I like it but make sure you have this in direct sunlight and plenty of water in the bird bath.
4	I'm really happy with the case. It's stylish and the color looks great. Complaints are that the pads on the bottom fell off (good thing replacements are included) and the keyboard cover doesn't lay as flat as I'd hoped.
4	My sister bought this, but she said that she didn't read it throughly, since it had bad words or inappropriate parts. Book is complete.
4	This is a cute swimsuit, but the top offers deceptively little coverage and tends to slip down when I'm moving around. Luckily, you can tighten the straps, so that does help a bit with that problem. Still, I would not recommend this swimsuit for anything who wears larger than a C cup.
4	I did not dislike anything about the product it was a great fit and my son loves them
4	Great sound. Video is good.
4	Absolutely love this set!! Super pretty without being overdone, only wish the bra straps were adjustable! I’m 5’5” and 130 lbs for reference
4	These were very adorable and though the one for the older kids was kind of small in length, it still made her dress pop!!
4	I ordered these boots in brown and received them in black - my third order that was incorrect from this seller! That said, I probably would have kept them, but they were far too large even though I ordered a half-size down as indicated in other reviews. I would caution other buyers to consider ordering a full-size down. That said, the boots seemed sturdy and were comfortable when I tried them on, and the style is just as nice as in the photos. Might try ordering again in a smaller size and pray the fourth time is the charm!
4	Came packaged nicely, however it was covered in lint..???? Super comfortable but the lint was rather annoying to remove.
4	Both for myself as a gift. Can’t beat the price
4	Lighter duty than previous printer MX 922 which we had for years. Paper tray capacity is smaller. Annoying that it forces you to use the rear paper feed for large format photo paper. It automatically changes the setting if you try to say you are printing 8 1/2 x 11 on photo paper. Main reason I chose the model is for the independent color ink cartridges. So many printers have a single cartridge for all colors resulting in a lot of waste when only one runs out.
4	Sneezy sure sang a lot. If you like Hank and his music you should like this.
4	Cute and served a purpose for a holiday party but not high quality for heavy use or multiple uses. I wear size 9 women’s, shoe covers fit well but pointed toe doesn’t stand up like in picture and I kept tripping over it.
4	Absolutely wonderful need to get 3 more
4	The charging and mounting worked great, but the release for the phone grip is a button behind the phone. Usually, without a case, your phone can depress this button and close the grip. However, some cases will have a gap near the button such that the button doesn’t depress.
4	Frame isn't wood but looks close. Sturdy board for the price.
4	I bought this thinking it was an iron on product for tshirts, but it is for decals. You also need to purchase transfer paper with it. For sticker decals, this is ok, its easier than rolls in certain ways.
4	Really cute! Ordered it for a toddler, fit perfect. Does come folded so takes a while to flatten.
4	Air needle is located in a compartment on the pump handle. Otherwise a good product.
4	One of my favorite movies . Drama and passion. Kinda predictable but still great for all ages.
4	This movie is a good classic
4	The pockets inside the bag are not thought out well. It makes it hard for this bag to be used for general daily purposes. It is only best for thin books and laptops. Otherwise good quality.
4	This was for gift-giving.
4	Wow! I love this cookbook! This cookbook are simple to follow and very healthy as well. The recipes are extremely tempting and at first look sufficiently basic, with this extensive variety of recipes I can make diverse dishes for my family consistently.
4	I received the wrong color the first time and had to reorder. But that happens.
4	Bought for our camper because these won't break. We like the thumb notch in the handle and the size. Coffee doesn't stain them.
4	I bought the teal color in both twin size and king size. The color is true to the picture - very bright. The twin size came rolled up in it's own container. The king size came vacuum packed and have may have been a return previously. I hope not b/c these are gifts. I did unzip the container and the blanket feels very soft. There is no smell. The price was great. So it is white on the sherpa side and teal on the top side. Now to the sage/green one. Very pale color but otherwise same as above. Again, a gift.
4	I was looking for something to keep me warm and soft, lately I have anxiety thinking of going to ross/marshalls/tjmaxx to go through all the racks and try to find a hoodie or etc. and try them all in dressing rooms only to find out it is too big or small! Anyways thats why I ordered this from amazon, the thing is I really liked it but I wish it was a bit thick and keeps you more warm but overall I liked it. I am gonna wear in the house and maybe while sleeping now in LA it is getting cold at nights. But if you are looking for something to wear outdoors and keep you warm this is not the product for you,and pockets have a weird fabric inside like polyester which I do not like. And hand wash only which is a problem for me we will see how it goes 😀
4	First one had a small leak on the faucet. Returned it, easy process. New one works great. Using it for church every week, so still holding up.
4	Good shoes for the price
4	This hatchet has very good head to total weight balance. I was disappointed with the narrow grip area on the handle. I plan on adding leather to the handle. Very sharp and stays that way.
4	It does the job, but not as sturdy as we had hoped. We thought that we were getting a higher grade of metal, but it is what we ordered.
4	I am disabled from terminal cancer, and pretty much doomed to live out the remainder of my days under home hospice and laid up on my comfortable couch. My large den is mostly lit by the neon signs I've purchased to adorn my man cave, with other lamps near the walls that sit on end tables and such. But I needed one light to hang over the arm of my couch with remote operation to give my immediate area some brightness at a touch, whether it be for reading or whatever. The lamp came in a deceptively small, but stout box. It assembled in moments, and was no problem to twist its light so that it hung directly over my shoulder and gave me the light I was needing. Its plenty bright to read by, or construct models, or whatever I can imagine I'd need. And the ability to adjust the light from a warm glow to a cool white is a nice touch. If I had any complaint, it would be the remote. Where still smaller than most other remotes I own, I don't think it warrants the need for five presets and AA batteries (not included). It's just a minor gripe that I thought I'd add on an otherwise perfect fit for what I was needing. A smaller remote that used AAA batteries and a smaller inventory of face buttons just seems much more feasible for such a simple device. For example, there is a button for "breastfeeding" that is indicated by the picture of a milk bottle. Ummm... okay then. But at any rate, great product! Keep in mind, I've only had it for only three days or so, so I cannot speak on item longevity.
4	The speaker is nice looking, small and light. It looks exactly as the photo shows. The sound is ok. Definitely not Bose quality or even close to it. But for $18 the sound quality matches the price. I’m using this speaker for my bedroom, so it’s fine. I wouldn’t use this as a speaker for a large area like a living room.
4	Well in the picture it says it has 2 vibrators when it really has only one. Other than that it's light and very versatile, I use it for my herniated disc and my epicondylitis and it's great that it's wireless cos I can take it with me to trips and restaurants and stuff. I just think the publicity has to be more accurate. It wouldn't hurt if it really had 2 vibrating points, and better yet, that not only the middle part vibrated but all 3 sections we're functional. Just an idea for Homedics.
4	Another good Samantha Wolf mystery. I'm not usually big on supernatural type stories but it isn't over done and seems to fit perfectly with this series. I've enjoyed them all, and like another reviewer said, the stories just seem to get better and better. Each book can be stand-alone if you desire, as the author explains who the characters are in each story and each story has a satisfying conclusion, but it's much more fun to read them all and that's what I recommend. By the way, I'm a 68 year old male, so don't just consider them only for girls or younger readers. Now I've got to buy the next one so I don't miss anything!
4	It's a very nice foundation. Not 5 star nice but good
4	So far, so god. Just started playing this game.
4	It's fun but she gets annoying! I am just glad she didn't "come to life" in the middle of the night forcing me to have to shoot it!!
4	Great tap show for the price. My only complaint is the sound quality isn’t that great but to be expected at this price point.
4	I really like this product, it very good! I will order more! 👌
4	Fits and looks nice . Many color choices . No advertising on hat , comfortable sizing strap .
4	THE BATTERY ONLY LAST ABOUT 4 HOURS BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S GOOD QUALITY.
4	Love them!!! However, after I sanded and washed them, they were a bit rough and I feel like they might splinter.
4	Not as loose fitting as I was suspecting.
4	Performing well so far.
4	This is made out of quality material. The Velcro is strong and the brace forces your shoulders back without pinching or discomfort. It is a smaller brace though and not one size fits all. It fits a child or someone with a small build the best. My 12 year old brother is using it and it fits well.
4	I have 2 switches and we all know how sensitive they are. These glass protectors work great and are a must have for the switch especially with Mario maker 2 coming out...a game that will beg you to use a stylus to play
4	It does it’s job. You get what you pay for. It works.
4	They do the job so far
4	great product, fast shipping. would highly recommend.
4	Did not know the gauze pad is made of individual sheets .They tend to move around.
4	The timer does what it's supposed to do. It's too soon to know if it saves me any money. There was a small bit of confusion in the wiring diagrams supplied : the main manual indicates that Terminals 1 and 3 need to be connected by a jumper wire and also Terminals 2 and 5. However, in the small enclosed package that has the jumper wires is a sheet that shows Terminals 1 and 5 to be connected and also Terminals 2 and 3. The problem is the supplied jumper wires are too short and those latter connections are impossible to make. It's a little confusing that there are two different jumper connection shown in the paperwork with the product. I went with the one that the wires were long enough to actually work with. In practice I suspect it doesn't matter. Beyond that confusion, the rest of the install was straight forward. Programming is pretty easy, the display however is rather small and you have to look at it closely. Doubling the size of the LCD would be nice ! The buttons were not as smooth as they could be. Sometimes a light press resulted in nothing happening and it was necessary to press rather firmly to get the display to change as expected. But once the setup is done, these don't have to be touched again unless the program needs to be altered. It is very easy to bring the water heater on out of cycle by just pushing the large button that is accessible without opening the timer door. It then stays on until the next programmed off cycle or until a user pushes the button again. I'll have to gather a few months of data to see how much I save by using this timer
4	The sound is pretty good. If they would get a little louder, I could give them a 5 star. What I Love about these: When you pull it out of the charging case, it automatically connects to my phone. When I stick it back into the charger, it disconnects. The fit. I didn't know if the upside down, fill your ear design would be comfortable, but it actually is. It makes these very stable and I can even run with them in without them moving at all. LIke, I said before, if these got a little louder, I could give them a 5 star. I didn't notice that these were noise cancelling. So can't comment on that. I only ever keep on in, so that's probably why I didn't notice.
4	I suppose product color is irrelevant due to what the intended use of this product is, but I'm still a little salty. 4 stars.
4	Love my new jeans... definatly found my new place ! They fit great!
4	Good book. Never read anything by this author prior to this but it was free in the sci-fi/fantasy section so I checked it out.
4	I love its construction and looks. was expecting a little more clean low end though.
4	I had a difficult time fitting one of the two mirrors in my bike handle. One side fits ok, but I could not get the other one all the way in the other side. Other than that, it's a nice mirror. I love the fact that it's adjustable in many ways, which gave me the flexibility I need. And it looks good on my black bike.
4	Works great and reasonably priced.
4	Bought this to tidy up some cords in my classroom (I'm a teacher). It's a bit narrower than I expected, but with a little work it fit everything I needed. My computer set up is now neat and out of the way! The included tool was super helpful in first getting the cords inserted.
4	Good product. I haven’t used many others to compare but I like it and it was easy to clean.
4	A little small but perfect for a ground blind.
4	This meets my needs for recycling and still lets me pick up and dispose of my dog’s waste.
4	Insightful, witty, perhaps unnecessarily verbose in places, and as with any book, you have to pan for the gold ... but those nuggets are there! This book will improve my writing, even if I do not 100% agree with all of the author's techniques.
4	These cartridges are a great alternative to the OEM at a fraction of the cost. The only downside is you are guessing at what color you are opening unless you find the sticker of what color it is through the yellow bag that they are each individually packaged in. The shipping box is solid and the foam fits great. All 4 are in one box and arrived perfectly.
4	has all that is needed
4	Saw a difference in days Good buy
4	It definitely is something you could make yourself but for the price you might as well buy this with your other special tools for fork work. It was very very handy for my seal replacement and made leveling my oil a breeze. Only thing I found wrong was it seemed on mine the measuring needle part was upside down as compared to videos I saw on it. Easy fix though, I didn't even flip it I just used math and subtracted from 300 instead of counting up from 0
4	These are ok. I have to constantly stop and clean it out when using it. It works ok when you very first use it for about the first 10 seconds then after that, you have to stop every minute or so and clean it out and oil it so it cuts the hair. I purchased a Wahl clipper years ago and I remember that cutting my dog's hair like butter but after a few years it barely worked even after I put in a new blade so I purchased this. It's not great but it's ok.
4	The arms on these are shorter than any other readers I have bought. Seem to be sized more for women than men. They look good, but don't fit that well for a man.
4	Cute design, but the top flap is kind of awkward. When the toybox gets full the box kind of bows out in different directions and the top doesn't really close correctly. It's a little sloppy looking. I like that it's soft though so you don't have to worry about smashed fingers.
4	Dog loves it. The sound is weird; sounds like there's an echo. I love that it comes with 2 covers.
4	I am not an expert on chai. I am rating this tea solely on it's own merits and not in comparison to other types of chai. It smells wonderful with all the warm spices you expect. The bags are individually wrapped. The labels on the bags recommend a steeping time of 5 minutes. This made a smooth mug of tea. There was no bitterness. I added 1 teaspoon of unprocessed sugar. I tried it before adding milk. The taste of the tea was far less strong than the scent of the tea. Without milk, it made for a delicate and pleasant tea. I could have even let it steep another minute. For the tea to have a full-bodied flavor with milk in it, I had to leave the bag in as I drank it or steep 2 bags at once for 6 minutes. Of course, personal tastes determine how a person likes their tea, but this review may give you a general guideline. It tastes especially good with a couple of teaspoons of 'Hoosier Hill Farms' powdered coconut milk in it. It pairs beautifully with the warm spices.
4	These gloves are perfect for pruning holly or pulling weeds, and they save me from the irritations usually caused because of my allergies.
4	Not as what I thought as the high light pens.But my daughter love them.
4	It’s a little small but it does the job
4	This is a great solution to the problem we had of not having a DVD player to watch all the kids movies that my mother in law has foisted upon us. It can plug into the tv, but far better is the ability to let my toddler get her limited screen time anywhere she pleases without forcing me to watch the movies. The seller even offered to send a free car headrest mount so we can take movie on the road. It also has a usb and sd card port so digital files can be played in addition to the discs. The controls are so simple my toddler can operate it, and the swivel screen is a great feature that allows the buttons to be hidden from the prowling 1 year old determined to press buttons and wreak havoc.
4	I got complimented already. Style, color and concept is great. Hate that it tangles easily. It's fashion jewelry. As expected, color changer and can tell it's ok quality
4	They are cute, but the fit is just okay. Keep slipping off the back of my heel.
4	Good for beginners, only downfall is the battery does not last long. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.
4	Liked the small round size very much since I only have a few daily pills. Would like the colors to be different to easily pick the right one for the time of day.
4	Wow better than I expected
4	I like this item, easy to set up and use. The only thing I don't like is trying to get it back in the bag. ugh I bought a golf mat too so I could use it in my hall. Would be nice if a mat was included.
4	Holds a lot of glasses.
4	Great Bulb, work amazing
4	It worked for what I needed it for
4	I have a King 💤 # bed & it fits perfectly plus color is deep & rich as pictured. I have not washed it yet & I did have to air it out for a slight odor.
4	Product received was as ordered. Shipping was delayed beyond original quote, however ordered product is a spare replacement, so no negative impact.
4	Hard to evaluate; I lost a pet and that is what this represents.
4	good sheets for the price
4	These are good they work well
4	the only thing was that the box had a whole in it but the puzzle inside was in a plastic bag with no damage.
4	I love how great amazon is about preparing food and household products for shipping. Everything is always packaged so well and isn’t damaged during delivery. Even drinks!
4	These are good movies. First one is the best. 2nd one is not too shabby. Both are certainly much, MUCH better than Jeepers Creepers 3. If you like horror films, give them a watch!
4	Great modem and router combination. No more need to lease a modem from the cable company, so it paid for it self in less than a year.
4	Great value for the money. It is a little firm, but it turns out that I like it that way. Plus it keeps you cool.
4	The wheel is nice and easy to set up, The cord from the wheel to the console is very short however. Also, if you do not have a proper desk and chair setup to mount this to that allows alot of body movement and a stable mount for the wheel the setup will feel inadequate. I feel like one of the special racing seats also sold on amazon is almost necessary to fully enjoy this product. Also the plastic screws that allow you to mount the wheel to a desk feel flimsy and breakable
4	Super soft and a great fit.
4	My baby loves it. I little in the heavy side.
4	The purse looks great, just too big for me. The wallet zipper broke the 2nd day. My coworker loves the purse.
4	Installation was simple and functionality is exactly as described. Would recommend for LED lights.
4	Very cute! Fits the note 9 well.
4	Loved this dress! Very comfy and fits great! Material is a little thin but not see through. I bought a large, in the navy blue.
4	Not a huge historical romance person, but I really enjoyed this book. It was a good read that flowed nicely. Author paid attention to detail and it wasn't to wordy with language that was used at that time.
4	The Murmur took a bit to get going but in the end I enjoyed the book and was racing through the last few chapters. Lots of characters to follow and they all "talk" at some point, so you need to pay attention.
4	Excellent read, intrigue suspense, whole lot of drama, betrayal, spiteful, confusion, revenge, and a whole lot of healing. I could not put this book down. Love the storyline but a little disappointed in the ending. Definite recommend.
4	The water was great, but a couple of the bottles lid was cracked so the water leaked out. Since they were contaminated I had to dispose of them. However, I would order again.
4	I like it however the scent is a bit strong. Definitely moisturizing!
4	Order arrived on time and as described.
4	I like the look and number of pockets but do wish the pockets were larger or the size of the bag overall was a little larger. I'm unable to fit some larger items (like my hairspray that I can't open to transfer to a travel size bottle) in there that I'm used to being able to fit in other toiletry bags.
4	great craft brushes. a little too absorbent. sucks up most of my mod podge
4	Great design. Comfy fabric
4	Wearing it for the first time and there are some things I like and some things I don't. I ordered my regular bra size. The next size up might be too big, not sure. I like the fact that there is enough closure on the side that skin does not bulge out but if I had a say in the design I would add more coverage in front. It is low and it tends to push your breast toward the center which causes a bulge. I like the back support and I think it will be more comfortable after I get used to it. Will wear for a week before deciding if I will keep it. Update: after wearing it for a few days I have concluded this bra is great for small busted women....however, full figure women might find the front coverage not adequate. I moved all the adjustments as wide as they went and the bra is comfortable enough to most likely keep. Will wear a week before deciding.
4	Needed this for a birthday gift. Arrived 10 days after ordering it, after I needed it to arrive, and customer service was very good with a refund. Pleased with them.
4	Nicely sized to fit within the Instant Pot for easy storage. The magnets were what sold me on this vs. other similar sets. DISAPPOINTING. They do not have enough strength to adhere tightly and they will not conform to the curvature of the Pot. One magnet was damaged, but will not seek a replacement as it won't work on the Pot anyway.
4	Not bad for what was paid
4	I need a half size smaller. Love the variety of rings I received . Very comfortable!!!!
4	These are great little rollers, however they were too small for what I needed them for.
4	Fast delivery to Canada. Thanks
4	Very fast delivery, just wish the designs were painted on and not made of plastic wrapping.
4	I Initially had issues with these units being too quiet like others have said, however I solved this by moving the speakers from behind the cheek pads to in front of the cheek pads. So the speakers are now directly touching my ears when the helmet is on instead of having an additional layer of fabric in between. I also noticed the volume is different depending on audio source. Bike to bike is actually pretty loud I could hear my buddy fine even at 85 mph (he was hearing a bit of wind noise though). Music is a bit quieter followed by answering phone calls paired to a mobile phone being almost too quiet (before moving the speakers). Music quality is obviously not great but at this price point I was not expecting it would match any set of headphones. Battery life seems to be good as well went for 3 relatively long rides (music and intercom) and it didn't die. I am not aware of a way to check the state of charge. If you are looking for a good COMS system for the cheap at 40 bucks a unit these are a solid choice but if you want good music quality then consider other options.
4	Pretty thin volume and some dated projects (a tie rack? maybe for a business dad?), but overall appealing to my kid with clear project instructions.
4	Really great for price but it is lacking a bit of flavor once brewed.
4	I gave 5 stars for battery life, but I truly can't say yet as it's still brand new. I've only been using this for about a week, but so far so good. There have been a few times the mouse doesn't respond, but it's only for a split second and doesn't stay that way. The spinning wheel for scrolling does feel a bit cheap and I'm concerned how well this will hold up through the wear and tear of normal everyday use, but it's doing okay so far. As far as looks go, it's super cute. I was in the market for a slim mouse and when I found this one with many different colors I couldn't pass it up. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase and would purchase it again.
4	Kiera gets a call, play the game or her twin will die. A stupid joke, until Kevin didn’t pick up the phone. Few clues that don’t add up, to Kevin now missing. Inhaling a powder at his apartment, almost proved lethal for her. A tense, fast paced story, that gripped a reader from the first when she gets a call. The only drawback for me, was her attitude. Continuing on with the next book in series.
4	Best price 50 leis.. only reason didn't give 5 star as size of flowers in all leis ar not same.. some are big as shown in pics.. and some are small... still good product..
4	Cute, fun and would make a great gift for all ages!
4	Very informative. Would have liked a little more elaboration on a few key principles but also appreciate the book was not made as an exhaustive study. Would definitely recommend,
4	The lids I received were grey, not black. They do not close, but otherwise, they are great.
4	When hitting the volume up/down button you can feel the give in the case and you can feel yourself hitting the buttons, but not on the power button. It feels hard and I can't tell if I am actually hitting the button or not. Case is really nice though. Very slick.
4	Received this product fast! Next day with regular shipping. It works well and was priced right! I’ll definitely order it again when I need it.
4	Bend kinda a weird way after awhile but the quality is still good and still charging my phone well!!!
4	Does the trick well but annoying because the clips don't fit under all parts of our top rack on our Town and Country. Fixed by removing clips and reattaching but took a decent amount of time. But otherwise we like it
4	There were a couple of fans that had broken thread and did not work properly, but they were what I needed for my event and they worked well.
4	Have used this for a few years before purchasing online. Same product, affordable and lasting size. Very content.
4	The case appears very sturdy and the color is gorgeous. I would prefer the rubber layer of the case fit a little more snug.
4	So soft - and such vivid colors! My grandson loves it - his big sister has a mermaid tail that made him just a little bit jealous, so now he's set with this "macho" one! I even got him a soft orange astronaut helmet to wear with it - it's perfect! (Gramma Scores!)
4	They are perfect besides the jack gets unplugged constantly
4	The reflective material started falling off within a week. But they seem comfy.
4	Ordered the t-shirt because i liked the style. I liked that it looked to run past the hips. I received in the mail and ordered XL and the shirt barely passes my bellybutton. I am tall and figured an XL would run pass my hips, but it didn't.
4	Decent quality, it does what I want/need it to. It will sit in my closet so wasn't looking for or expecting a "show piece", especially at the price. Not great but not horrible either, really about what I expected maybe a little better even for the price. Sure the finish could have been better, but it isn't an $100+ showpiece either. It did include the watch pillows which was nice and wasn't 100% expected also.
4	So, in terms of sizing, I would say if you want it to fit as your regular size- most likely size up. I was worried based on the model sizing pics and went up 2 sizes, from a M to an XL and it fits but is definitely long on me and a little baggy but I guess thats good since I'm 15 weeks pregnant and have room to grow into it but if you want it to fit like your regular size, only go up 1 size if even that.
4	I think is very nice gun , for the money is good ! I have used contractors gun from graco and feel just like it . Plus extra filters. Great deal.r
4	Not bad. Just a lil to big.
4	Not a huge fan of the flavor but it works so I keep buying it! Spicy. My friend LOVES the flavor soooo
4	Works but not as nice to turn and use to tighten.
4	First sword I bought on Amazon and honestly not that disappointed, the only critique that I have is that it came and what looks like very used condition there's stains all over the sword itself and the sheath, it also had a very weird smell to it.
4	Protects iPhone in a compact design but allows phone's appearance to show through.
4	I love the ease of printing my own photos, but the cartridge and paper are expensive compared to getting prints at a local store.
4	Really pretty color, nice quality, fits my phone perfectly, and has pronounced buttons for easy use. I only wish I could fit more than one card in the card holder slot.
4	Some of the tips were damaged, however, they are very nice. Love the variety of colors.
4	Will come in handy on the beach
4	They are nice bags for the price. We used them for my daughter's birthday party as goodie bags and personalized them for each girl. While we were ironing on some of the letters the bag seemed to get to hot and now have little ripples in them not bad enough that they can't be used but that's why I gave them 4 stars since they said they could be used with iron-on transfers also the strings seem cheap but it goes with the price paid. They did turn out cute and I think the girls will love them!
4	It fits tight and make sure you wash it by hand and don’t put it in the dryer
4	These are really cute, however, I rated these 4. When completely screwed on, the flowers are not even on each side. I’d have to loosen the one end in order for them to match up.
4	Works really well, but months later I still have to pick off little pieces of cotton on me from the towel after drying off.
4	Daughter loves it. Is wearing it tomorrow for Halloween and will use it for dress up after that.
4	Ii would have given it a 5 star rating, but the non-stick coating is delaminating from both the upper tray and the inside bottom of the basket. This surprises me a little bit, as I’ve always hand washed and it’s never been in the dishwasher.
4	Exactly what I needed to hang my plates.
4	Nice build, fits perfect. Great product for the price.
4	All good except that the button for the tilt mechanism is way too high up for me to use, so basically, that function is useless.
4	Not as laugh-out-loud funny as some of the other Vacation movies, but clever.
4	For the value it works great. Although, I would recommend hosing it out occasionally.
4	Spiritual concepts made personal through characters. Comforting, gentle thoughts.
4	Would have given five stars if this included the labels.
4	Work great. After a couple tailgates these start losing grain. No major complaints though.
4	Works great but came with a corner broken.
4	These are super cute. They look nicer in person. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are very wide. But other than that they are great.
4	Love these excellent quality and my kids love them, but wish they made a truck or car to pull them with! Also the only complaint is that because they are close when attached, when turning curves the magnets will sometimes catch each other and mess up the creation!
4	Works well for our bathroom counter. We have really tiny counters so this is perfect to keep things organized and out of the way. Easy to clean and very nice to have. I recommend this product.
4	Arrived just as stated
4	Good product. Feels solid which is nice but I have a bit of trouble latching it onto some tire stems without leaking a bit of air, but once it is on its fine.
4	I liked the hero and heroine. Their chemistry felt real and compelling. The mystery’s ending, however, felt abrupt and unresolved.
4	Enjoying my fire hd.
4	Which movie & tv shows news.
4	I love these crackers. But somehow these didn’t taste quite the same as the crackers that come in the small packages.
4	The silver in the band isn't as silver or shinny as in pictures, but still looks good. Looks like it might last through some rough wear, but we'll see.
4	This is a good sized screen but is not lined in the back however this dosent appear to be an issue if theres no light coming from behind the screen. My kids hook the xbox up to it and play video games on it and we had outdoor movie night and it worked great! It is a light frame and will need to be weighed down a little if its breezy outside. I am very happy with this purchase!
4	These help me with toe alignment blisters
4	Works for a bike carrier!
4	Used for exercising with abdominal hernia Seems to be helping
4	Used for medical purposes. Smell was pleasant and mild. No irritation. Pump makes it easy to use.
4	Works good. I have a small dog who does not let toe nail clippers anywhere near her. This allows me to somewhat trim her nails. For a less scared dog, this will work even easier. It has two speeds and is lightweight and easy to hold. Charged fast.
4	Very official looking. Slightly blurry but not enough to be problematic. Seems durable. I like that the fields of text are somewhat customizable to protect my privacy.
4	I love the tools, they are great! Work well and made well. The stencils are just paper so they aren't the easiest to use because you have to be very careful with them in order to not ruin them. The tools are really handy and pretty much any design you decide to do there is a tool for. The tools are well worth the price of the set and the stencils are just a bonus.
4	The blue tooth keyboard case was easy to pair to the iPad. It comes with a charger. The case is nice and slim its not bulky as you might think for a keyboard case. I like that there are multiple angle options for propping up the iPad. The magnetic closure is good and strong. I just wish that it would auto sleep and wake upon open and close.
4	Pretty good but the material somehow bleeds or turns darker over time
4	I like this duvet but it's not for everyone. I chose this one because it claimed to be an all season duvet cover and so far that's held up true for winter, I haven't gotten to test it out in summer yet. I needed something to keep me warm yet be light enough to not cause my fiance to sleep hot, I didn't notice that the covering was 100% polyester and thus he still sleeps hot yet not as much as before. This is the only downside I have found in this duvet so far besides the fact that it doesn't fit properly in the two cal king duvet covers i purchased separately, it's about 4 inches smaller than my covers. But all in all it is a thin duvet that keeps me warm and is soft to the touch so I'm happy with it
4	Our two kitties like this wet food. We also feed them Stella & Chewies chicken & a high quality kibble so they get well balanced meals.
4	The only drawback is the way they plug in. The large USB connection sticks out a couple of inches and therefore tends to get knocked around.
4	Second time I bought this product. Gave one to my sister who also got a Samsung Galaxy Note 9.
4	Ok but have an aftertaste when using with water
4	This product was semi easy to put together and fits well in the location it was purchased for.
4	Good size, easy to use. But they came very dull, and sharpening them from dull was not simple. But I'm happy with them
4	It was a gift, don't think they have opened it. sorry
4	They are a gift, so I don't know if they will wash well.
4	I really like this product. It feels good to get a little head massage but I find it best to use when you're ready to go to bed or can at least relax. My eyes shake/vibrate when it's on and it's actually pretty uncomfortable for me. But I do love this product! I just have to close my eyes.
4	The first one was broke due to poor packaging. The replacement came in beter packaging. Looks really cool and had several comments about it from Friends. I give it 4 stars do to the poor packaging and having to send back.
4	Amazingly cute!! They are a Xmas gift so I still don’t know if theyre comfy but they look amazing
4	I have had the elastic version of this belt for some time now in a navy color and really like it except for the fact that being elastic when I unbuckle it, it will pop out of my belt loops so decided to try the clear plastic one. I find the elastic type to be more comfortable than the clear plastic but works well also and does not pop out of my belt loops.
4	Light came intact and safe but one of the two lights wasnt working. Oak leaf has great customer service and sent two new ones to me within the week. The lights are very pretty and add a great accent, they do feel a bit fragile though.
4	Nice pillow covers. Great to put on over your existing pillow to update for the fall. Lightweight and should be easy to clean.
4	My son loved his lego themed balloons. And so did all the kids at his party. The only reason for 4 stars is because some of the balloons lost their faces when it was blown up. Not many though. I’d still buy them again.
4	I loved on how the writer explains everything in sequence, even if it some parts were way too technical and are not for everyone to comprehend. Found a lot of interesting/previously-unknown facts and felt that I actually got something out of the book.
4	Awesome lock good outside in desert weather. The numbers dont unlock in the center and if its dark kind of a pain. But will buy another
4	Work great just impossible to get completely clean
4	Likes: great design, well built. Dislike: I have a tendency to want to lean slightly on the table but am afraid to with the 20 pound capacity.
4	Good read that held my interest! It kept me guessing who the murderer was. Loved the different personalities of the main characters. Hope you're still writing.
4	I like how it looks.
4	Great product easy to install very sturdy
4	My dog seems to like it
4	doesn't have the range promised. Works pretty well, though.
4	Bought for acne for my son. Does a good job. Does not foam up, but it does seem to be working just fine.
4	Fun game for the family. I was a little disappointed that the box came with a hole in it. It was a gift for my my brother and didn't have time to return it. Bit of a bummer.
4	This came out to be exactly what I wanted. It wasnt see thru and it provided the privacy I needed. The only thing was my dog liked to take the leaves off 🙄.
4	Enjoyed this story very much. The mystery and romance were well intertwined. It almost Made me want to believe in ghosts.
4	I really like this iced coffee. Great product. Also wonderfully packaged and shipped. I had an issue previously with way product was packaged and condition in which product arrived. Amazon replaced and perfectly presented.
4	For the price I paid this unit is a good mix of versatile and portable. Good for visiting with friends or other small social occasions.
4	Good product but too expensive
4	Entertaining and not typical
4	Easy to play. Good time waster.
4	Was a great gift and since I am listening to it as well. I can say it is worth purchasing, especially if you are going on a long trip.
4	I love this strap. I use it as a safety strap when I carry my DSLR with a large lens. I am able to secure it close enough that when I walk long distances, the strap carries some of the weight instead of it all being on my hand. Only problem with it, for me....the carabiner is metal and connects to the camera plate which is also metal. So, when I walk they clink against one another. Bad news for a wildlife/bird photographer. So, I am currently searching for a solution to that. Maybe a plastic connection or a small strap. We'll see. Update: I used a bolt cutter to cut off the steel snap with swivel from the webbing and replaced it with an aluminum carabiner. Problem solved.
4	I like these rubber protectors because they provide grip and the clear protector was cool because my laptop has lights and they shine through it, but the only con of this was it stretched out and it doesn't fit my laptop properly anymore
4	This is cute but not as I expected. About the size of your night stand. Can hold 50 files the way it's designed.
4	They are leak proof, durable, and good for traveling, however some of the lips on the cups were messed up and the lids were also sometimes wonky. I ended up having to throw out some non-usable ones.
4	Loved it! However, some of these come with a little design that has a pointy end (ex. The star) and at times it’s uncomfortable for the kids. But bc you get so many you have plenty of options of the safer ones.
4	Very soft, and actually has deep pockets. Fabric is thin so will hold off on durability
4	This works great, on my home made pie crusts. Friends think I have skills, but I don't. Very happy.
4	This product is such a great idea, being able to write on the magnetic strip. I used it to assign tablets at work to employees for each shift
4	I don’t think this thing came with instructions, but it was easy to set up regardless. Took about 15 minutes to set up. We had 3 adults in this tent and still had plenty room left to spare. You can fully stand up in this tent.
4	Advice.. Measure twice & order once. Looks to be very good quality, unfortunately I ordered too large so waiting for the new one. Confident it will be of equal quality.
4	This is a beautiful and well made wallet EXCEPT that the snap closure does not allow ant “give” when the wallet is filled. Snapping it closed is difficult. If that problem is corrected it would be perfect!
4	Very pleased with my purchase. The only not con: the specially designed trays: for bowls, plates...they don’t work. This product would be 5 stars if they just supplied 4 flat trays as opposed to the differently designed trays. They don’t fit any plates or bowl I have. And I’ve tried all of them. For reference I have fiesta ware dishes and also replay brand kid dishes. None of the bowls or plates fit in the weird trays provided. But I’m still able to use it and it still works good enough. Pleased with the available drying space and pleased it doesn’t take up too much counter space. Easy to assemble. Very functional for use with window plants as well.
4	So far my son really likes this Headset!
4	Great addition to the Halloween costume
4	Nice collection of one of our favorite sci-fi series with plenty of extras about the makings of the show and the evolution of the storyline. However, some scenes in the middle of some episodes lose their focus or definition for some unknown reason.
4	Very pleased with this purchase ..
4	Don’t be a fool and but HDMI cables from your local store. These are just as good if not better and at better price. Used these on an installation and they worked as they should.
4	The ONLY reason I didn’t give this 5 stars is bcuz of the sting. It was kind of pointless since it didn’t really tighten the fit and then fell out first wash. But the fit itself is spot on! They’re extremely soft && cute. Prob my favorite comfy pants now !
4	Bought the set for both specifically for relocation. They are cheap and get the job done, especially a set of 5 can move substantial amount of clothes (3 suits OR 6 dress shirts on hangers in each bag). It was perfect as the moving company provides clothes hanging boxes and I do not want to have the clothes contact them. The problem was that the zipper was fairly weak. I only used the zipper once on all of them, and the zipper on one bag already failed. The material is on the flimsy side as well. For the price it was a great one time temporary use, for something that you will reuse a lot, it'll be better to invest in something with better quality.
4	Great product, wished price was lower
4	One thing that drives a person nuts is trying to find a missing puzzle piece. Yep, one border piece missing and the company is unable to replace this piece. However, pieces fit snug and clean, which enables one to pickup three or four pieces that have been put together and move to the main puzzle. My wife, who has dementia was able to work with the larger pieces. Overall, this is a great puzzle.
4	Anything made by Gorilla is great...this is no different. I used it to secure loose exterior faucet to brick....works like a champ.
4	Very nice and great quality.
4	A good value. It's great to have the latches; it's great to see through the tote to see what's inside.
4	Great toilet paper but the rolls are really large. Didn't fit well unless I took some sheets off first.
4	Came apart real easy. To small for growing African grey
4	Easy to use, still learning.That I can get help of O should need it.
4	Works as intended. I would add a couple of nice touches as a light up remote control and longer wall electric plug. Not a lot of instructions, but really is so simple to install anyone can figure it out. will order extra to gift.
4	I have huge boobs so it hard to find anything that will fit right and I jean completely right. I how ever love the way it fits
4	I ordered for a friend who wanted them. She thought they'd be larger in size but theyre sturdy looking. It's costume jewelry
4	My only complaints about this tent is it had a weird smell to it for the first couple of days sure that's typical with any tent & the zipper is loud & sometimes catchy. All the poles & corner pieces are metal not plastic. I put electrical tape at each connection helped with the rattling & the squeaking.
4	Great story that follows Marisol and Chase from Possess through Valentine's Day. It is a super sweet story that you don't have to have read Possess to enjoy. But is also a very nice addition to learn more about what happens to them if you have read the main story already.
4	I liked the ideal of how it works and after first use, hearing strange sounds. In my opinion the hose connections seemed to be a little delicate.
4	Product was as described. Looks good and blends well.
4	This is lovely and exactly what I wasn’t looking for - but a large (my normal size) was a bit loose around the chest. The item description says this will only work for A-C, but I’m a DD and think it’s fine. It was right enough around “the girls” but was loose around the band. I’m 5’3’’ and 160lbs. I don’t know my normal band and cup size because I exclusively wear bralettes.
4	I really liked it easy to use.
4	Good grip on these cups because of the perforated outer shell design.
4	This set worked perfectly for my daughters trolls themed 2nd birthday party.
4	Loooks nice. Soft fabric. Material is just as expected. Well worth the money.
4	I love the way the journal feels, and the pages are thin, but still sturdy enough to hold up to markers, glue, and whatever else you want to stick inside your journal. There's also a nice pocket at the back for holding inserts. I've gotten a different color of this journal before and have been overall happy with it. The journal has a Key Page, three index pages, two pen test pages, and a mindfulness page. the key and index pages are before the journal and not included in the numbered pages (which is perfect, I find the index very useful). The pen test, and mindfulness pages, however, ARE included in the page numbers. they're located at the end, and not terribly obstructive. But slightly annoying. According to the product description there should be 201 pages PLUS the pen test and mindfulness page. I've gotten their journals before, I have this exact one in a different color and it has 201 pages plus the extras so I'm not sure why the burgundy one doesn't. Not a huge deal, but frustrating considering I'm using this specific journal for a project and I want to use all 200 pages.
4	I purchased these to use in a home office. They are made very durable and look nice. They hold markers and erasers nicely. They are designed to be mounted by screws, which are not included. Overall, I am happy with my purchase...
4	In spite of some reviews, I think this is a decent, lightweight travel case for jewelry. I like the color, zipper and compartments. I was looking for something specifically designed to hold multiple necklaces with thin chains that tangle easily, and something that could handle multiple pairs of dangly earrings. I don't have a ton of rings and heavy bracelets, so I didn't need that kind of storage. This one will work. I just wish could find one that is more artistic (perhaps featuring the art of famous artists, or rock 'n' roll, edgy themes, etc.) and made out of organic cotton/linen or hand-tooled leather (boho) for a decent price. These plastic quilted cases are not exactly my style, and the cloth jewelry rolls don't seem to have the structure or storage I need. Thoughts? Anyone?
4	They sound very good. I’m quite pleased with the audio quality. The metal machining is also very expensive looking but the edges are a bit sharp. The cord is sturdy and looks like it would last a long time, but I am disappointed in how easily tangled it is. The cord is a bit sticky, so it’s harder to just shake out the tangled parts like I would expect from a non tangle cord.
4	Have to have the app open for it to receive data. That’s stupid
4	Worked well and met my beeds for a replacement bell
4	These cabinets come in a compact box with foam padding to prevent shipping damage. That's a nice feature. They come in a compact box because the cabinets are actually made up of three rectangular shaped units. That helps to make them fairly strong once they are put together with the back panels. I have been putting together press board furniture for 30+ years and have seen the parts quality and chip board quality decrease. This is about as low in quality as I have seen yet, but it still works to suit a purpose. There is a faint chemical smell from these. The best way I have to put these together is to put the top box together first on a carpeted floor, square up the box and attach the back panel, then attach the second box, square it up again and attache the back panel, etc. I used some glue I had around for strength. The dowel pins are small. I have never seen them that thin before, but again they do the job. I bought two and have only put together the first one so far. The only thing I will do differently with the second one is to use small finish nails instead of the easily bendable things they provide. They should have provided plastic covers for the cams, but once the cabinets are loaded they are not visible. There are small holes in the top panel to secure the cabinet to the wall. I would have preferred that they not leave holes in there. Once fully put together the cabinets look decent and are fairly sturdy. They are just the right size to have six rows of DVDs or Blu Rays. The main reason I got these is because they fit in very small spaces and I needed extra storage. If I was looking for something more permanent, I definitely would look at other products. As it is these should be viewed as cheap and disposable but good for the purpose they are made for. I had thought about using two cabinets and building them so they are five boxes high instead of three. May still try that, and if I do it would be necessary to anchor them to a wall. The back panels are not really configured to do that because their interlocking "jigsaw" pattern is specific to three boxes, but it may be worth a try to save floor space. A wall of these things could look pretty cool and would be functional.
4	The only problem is that the sides of the bag have to be taped down to the plastic inner section before sliding it into the steel container
4	These are nice for the pool area, but they stuffed them all in one cup so the opening makes them look kind of cheap
4	This case is tasteful without being too plain. It doesn't stay closed--I would have liked a strap and snap closure, but otherwise it is fine.
4	Bought it for my spouse, but it would not fit comfortably around his head. He said it was uncomfortable and can't use it. Now I'm using it, and I have to stretch the band out before I do since it gets uncomfortably tight. I would only buy this again if these headbands were in a larger size. I'm petite and it was still tight around my head. Sound quality, buttons, everything else was decent.
4	Nice but produces lots of oil
4	Great bag, but the color is more like a raspberry red, than a wine red. Great purchase for the price though.
4	My mom received cart yesterday. Very happy but could not find the cloth that comes with it. Will someone please send the cloth?
4	Update- The seller contacted me after I had received my refund and sent a new one. Its arrived and isn't too bad, the fur isnt as thick as I would like it to be jut that's okay. One big thing I noticed however is the Packaging was INCREDIBLY different from the first I was sent. This second one came in a fancy zippered bag, while the other was a regular taped close bag. Which was very odd as I'd expect more continuity in companies. When I got this item off my porch the box was SOAKED, not just a little wet, but so wet it was crumbling under my fingers. I still kept some hope, because maybe the fur was in a sealed bag?? It was not, the bag was open ended and filled with water. Normally during rainy and snowy days the packages I receive are wrapped up tight in a bag or other wrap so prevent damage. So I had been feeling comfortable in ordering despite the oncoming snow and not being home. I'll have to change that policy now.
4	Very good value!!!! Nice pictures but have not even used and binding is coming apart or this would be a five star review
4	i thought the tone would be lower....i searched for a "C" note wind chime like my sister has and this one came up....it is a pleasant sound and i like it but not what in was searching for....
4	Surprisingly good for a low-budget knife!
4	Very nice jeans. a little big in the waist but wearable.
4	i mainly needed a sim tool however i find myself using the plyers on this fairly often i just wish it was a little more low profile so it would fit more comfortably in pockets other then that it works great.
4	Works but the guide bar is not too helpful
4	Got several compliments on this.
4	works well. used it with my cell phone and functions as it should. wanted to use it with my tablet but was unable to configure it. maybe with a bit more work I could get it to work.overall a good scope for the money
4	They aren't strong enough to keep their shape but definitely keep the seat backs cleaner.
4	i like the gap on the top of the armband that allows to connect the headphones. i have an iphone x and if fits just perfect. make sure you check the zise chart so you can be happy with the product
4	This book help to discover for how to find the right house, flip it for the greatest profit and market it for the quickest sale. Regarding this book privy to some of best kept secrets of today investors, by avoiding the common mistakes minimize risks and maximize returns in the fastest time possible.
4	A super hot and fast read. I loved the dynamic between the two and the introduction to the M.C. Seriously looking forward to what happens next. I love me a good hot steamy romance.
4	Mina is a very interesting excitable character. I like the descriptions of the animals and the pet rescue business. I recommend this book if you enjoy animals and the mysteries that happen around them.
4	Today I assembled this unit, there certainly are a lot of parts. Although this isn't a particularly difficult piece to assemble, being sober while putting this one together is a good idea. After it was finished I was quite happy with how tight the fabric shelves are and how solid the finished product is.
4	great for the price.
4	You can charge your phone like twice . Almost three
4	My wife loves it, So I love it too 😋...
4	I love this light. I work at night and have worn it around my neck to work every night since I received it. It's super bright and allows me both hands to work with and not have to hold a flashlight.
4	Fits perfect with my Mustang. Definitely helped keep the inside a little cooler.
4	Bought this for my grand daughter. But since it was refurbished, it did not come with any instructions. We are not that "tech savvy" so we are still trying to figure out how to do all the different features. Went online and can't find a manual there either. Other than that, it works great and the rubber cover is a great added feature for "kid proofing".
4	Thought it would be bigger for 4 pounds
4	Does not look like the pic online ok for the money
4	Powerful, but too difficult for beginner
4	This is a good product for the price tag. However not a great quality material. However why to complain, it's great for the price tag
4	I bought this to wear under an open topcoat. The material is thicker than other maxi dresses which is great in that it’s less see though. However, the stretchy material hangs in a way that will accentuate any flaw you may not want showing. I wanted a loose fit and it is. The only thing I don’t like is the bottom! It tappers in and makes it hard to walk a full stride. Feels restrictive. Looks pretty while standing still. And I’m only 5’2 and a Small is pretty long. I’ll need to take about 5” off so maybe that will help me get a better stride! Ha! Lovely dress though.
4	These were easy to install and seem to be of decent quality. The finish looks good with all my different door styles and colors. I really wanted all my doors to be keyed alike, and this set provided that option. In fact, each set came with four keys, so I have plenty of spares.
4	Does the job, but inputs on controller seem to lag slightly. Could be an issue with all adapters in general.
4	Great product. My daughter loves Lara Croft and tomb raider. Solid materials and looks pretty good for a necklace of this price. Well done!
4	Bright sign, looks good by the bar
4	Very soft and a great price
4	The shipping of my order was delayed a few days.
4	We went camping right next to the lake so the bugs are bad and these seemed to help a lot. The way this band goes on isn't the best for kids. It seems to get stretched easy and then falls off.
4	Works ok, didn’t hold up as long as I figured. Used to hold a Cobb accessport. Help up for about a week in cold weather. May work better in the summer time
4	Good quality sound and very comfortable fit. Unfortunately, it does not connect to my Nexus 6P phone.
4	Very easy set up, and works very well. Only reason I'm not 5 stars is the drive seems slower than I expected. Quality and appearance is really good, but a bit faster would be nice. I use this drive every day, and I'm typically using an SSD, so my view of speed may be a bit warped. I've been using SSD for a long time so my expectations for speed on a portable drive may be somewhat unrealistic. I definitely recommend this drive.
4	Really amazing headphones for the price. Amazing wood finish. The bass is very punchy and the highs are decent. Connectivity is great, and I could go a good day and a half with these headphones when I'm on campus. The fins of the earbuds tend to hurt a bit if worn for a longer time, even with the perfect size fit; it could, however, only be my ears, and they do provide other types of fins. My only biggest complaint with these earbuds are that it often falls off when they rest on your neck and off your ears, because the control hub (where the volume control and pause/play controls are) are not in the midpoint, but instead more towards your right ear, and is quite heavy.
4	I haven't been playing that long but long enough to know I'm going to be playing this a long time.
4	These are just like old keys and fit our purpose perfectly
4	I like everything about this cane EXCEPT it needs another notch so the handle can go just a bit lower. I'm 5' 5" and being able to lower it one more notch would have been perfect and a 5 star!!
4	7 year old niece loved it
4	Snug fitting since there is no zipper. Makes getting on and off trickier
4	Good coverage of UK Rugby Easy to install and use.
4	No complaints of as of yet. Received the case in good condition. Fits iPad Pro 9.7 well. Not too heavy. Aesthetically pleasing while offering protection without adding much weight. My only gripe would be that I can’t fold the cover completely behind the iPad if needed. Recommended otherwise!
4	Love it! Just with it was big enough to hold 2 sticks of butter! I’ve had butter bells in the past. They broke over time and were never replaced. Happy to have them again and these are really nice. They look kind of old and fit will in my old country kitchen!
4	Got to light up flag on pole. Clamped one to pole facing upward using hose clamps. Orher a few feet away to side of deck. Adequately illuminates flag on 25’ pole. Nice product.
4	I was really nervous to buy this wig as it was my first time ordering hair online, but I am completely satisfied. Fast delivery, and the hair is very soft with minimal shedding. The hair line was preplucked and didn’t need any additional plucking or bleaching of the knots. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.
4	I am always freezing since losing weight after gastric sleeve, and ask my other sweaters have gotten too big, so i needed a new one. This sweater definitely achieves warmth, haha! My only issue is that the hand holds don't have much stretch. These sweater fits add expected, but it does make it difficult to pull up my sleeves in the case of getting to warm. Overall, though, I love the softness & fit of the sweater & would recommend.
4	Fantastic psychological thriller. Grabs you from the very beginning and never lets go. Will definitely read other Shalini Boland books.
4	I am so glad I bought this book! It’s only been a couple of days but I’ve made several of the recipes. a lot of information on the Keto lifestyle including tips on being successful if you need to make substitutions. She suggests products and tools she uses too. I’m so glad I purchased this book. I cannot wait to try more recipes!!
4	Not sure on these, they are a bit too heavy for my liking and the backs are very long. My daughter loved her pair but I don’t know that I will wear mine.
4	Product seemed to work well, but my dog prefers to lay on the tile instead of the cooling mat. I had to return but the seller was very accommodating.
4	Feels good on the skin and smells great!
4	Would give 5 stars, works really well but doesn't have as many different guides as other Clippers...(for different length cuts).
4	I purchased a small and seemed closer to the size of a medium. Otherwise very nice shirt with soft material.
4	well i bought this set for the cloth button and waist extender. they all seem to be made well but, the non-button extender ones are too slim and aren't large enough to allow pants part to hook up to it, least not the pants i tried to use them with.. the button version is fine.
4	Good enough for HS Grad
4	I was looking for some more usb type c cables to have some at work and at my computer at home. These work really well. My only complaint is that the cables are a little stiff and hard to cable manage, but I'm sure they'll get a little more flexible with time.
4	I'm very happy with these rods. The offer the option of also screwing end mount into the window case.
4	These really are great. The only down fall I have is it’s so hard to get the lids to snap on. Otherwise, 100% recommend. Love them.
4	Was a bit hard to put together due to the vague directions!
4	Fairly large for a countertop. Makes ice quickly. Good for daily use.
4	There are clearly many things to like about this air purifier, but "smart" wifi operation is not one of them. The unit fails to setup wifi on my mesh network which supports both 2.4ghz & 5ghz. Customer service has confirmed that the AirMega will not work on my wifi network or any network that uses the same SID for 2.4 & 5ghz. This leaves out my new Eero mesh network, and would have also failed on my prior non-mesh network because it too used the same SID for 2.4 & 5ghz. After reading some of the other complaints by reviewers, it appears that AirMega may be knowingly selling a wifi connected air purifier that does not work on modern common place wifi networks. The published suggested solution of slowing down your entire wifi network by disabling 5ghz is not a viable solution or a workaround in my book. Also, one smaller point is that the air purifier has 4 speed settings. The top two settings are very loud. Other air purifiers I own (BlueAir for example) are reasonably quiet on all except the maximum fan speed setting.
4	I like the design but it’s a little heavy and peeled my wall paper.
4	Amazing book. I love it. Thanks author. Highly recommended.
4	Love!!! So soft and so so cute!! It fits jus as expected!! Very soft material. Love
4	So I’ve been wearing this ring for 6 months now. It looks amazing when it’s clean but I feel like you have to clean it often for it to look good. For durability I still have all my stones however the metal the ring is made of is soft. I bent mine so there’s a flat spot on it. I would buy the ring again, I love it and it’s holding up great, I just have to be a little more gentle on my hands.
4	It provide good protection for sure and if you have a space grey model then the black is not gonna be noticed that much and it will blend in quite well. The only down side is by daily use sometime you lose the touch sensitivity and afraid by time it will loosen up and this will increase the issue if touch sensitivity, and sure not suitable for swimming or any water exposure as it traps a bit of it and must be dried afterwards.
4	excellent food storage bins. would buy again
4	I like the phones a lot. They were very easy to install and set up. Sound quality and many functions, including intercom and transferring calls internally are good and easy to use. I had one base with a charging wire out of place, but it worked after I bent it a bit. They offered to replace everything, but I didn't want to take them all out and send them back, especially since I got the fifth base to charge.
4	Bought for my 8 yr old son, so far he’s loving it! Learning to play in the schools Uke Troop
4	Product feels like it's well built. Works for my application.
4	Bought this item for my cable collection,have not had a need to use it yet.
4	Love it. Just like the case I had for my old phone and that lasted me 5 years till I got a new phone. So I know this will last me just as long.
4	I was given great communication from the company and recieved my adapters right on time.
4	I always love a Ken Follett novel, especially the sequels to Pillars of the Earth, one of my all time favorites. I enjoyed the well-fleshed-out characters (even the ones I hated, like Pierre and Rollo) and the authentic setting. Rich and engaging as always. I did feel that Column of Fire fell short in the shifting action between France and England. It lacked the connection that we usually have to Kingsbridge.
4	Adorable dress. Sizing is a bit off. My daughter normally wears a 6, but an 8 in the dress fits
4	They are good but more for decoration rather then using them as an actual mirrors. Some of the pieces are small. The biggest surprise for me was that they are not glued to the wall with like double sided tape. They actually need nails or screws to be put on. So when you put them on the wall, they would not be flat with the wall. They will have a slight angle because of the screw. I am still not sure whats better, tape or screw... maybe actually screw is better.
4	Purchased for use on the full sized windows in my finished basement, as a transitional window treatment for the early Spring. Winter drapes, while doing the job for the insulation we need in the North Country (usually until June!), feel too dark. These curtains, in a vibrant grass green, being that pop of Spring color plus the insulation needed.
4	Good knife, what I expect from Cold Steel but in personal preference I like the bowie
4	It is perfect for downsizing your computer space. Study and attractive, I assembled it myself with no help. Instructions were very clear and accurate. My only consideration is that my swivel chair needs to be offset a bit, so I have to scoot it to the left to align it up with keyboard. It’s not a huge problem, and I’m glad I bought the desk.
4	I love the phone case. It looks and fits great. The phone case is perfect. The screen cover was ok. The first one broke while putting it on the phone and the second one will not fully stick to the screen. It works ok and is usable, but not perfect.
4	I need this since when I purchased a couch (site unseen) the images made the color look a gray / brown but when it arrived it was brown and clashed with my black entertainment center and grey curtains. Only 4 stars because the black on one of the covers is faded compared to the other.
4	Very quiet. Easy to refill. Have been using it every night for a month and no white crust has appeared yet. Full tank may last for three nights if is on the lowest setting. I am very happy with it. It has really improved my sleep. I would recommend it. Only 4 stars because I would like for it to have a room humidity measure on display or something just to know what is the right setting.
4	This mattress protector is okay. There's no cushion or softness in this protector. The material is towel like and the sides are made of really nice silk material. I would recommend this if you're allergic to dust mites.
4	Love the blue color! Not super bright but ok. So far all 8 of 8 work, have survived the rainstorms. Easy to install but I did not use the fasteners, I used stainless screws.
4	I got these because i saw them featured (not this particular brand) on a talk show. They are nice, and will keep out the sun from damaging your eyes and causing wrinkles....very cool!
4	Overall very nice chair. The cover that goes at the base of the chair came broken however. Not a very big deal to me though. It is very easy to put together and very comfortable otherwise! Its definitely not meant for a very big person though. I'm about 5'4" and 145lbs and I fit in the chair perfectly but there isn't much room to adjust or shift around.
4	Wish they work better but they helped some
4	Bought as a gift. Is beautiful set, seemed well made.
4	Bought this as my first drone. I was swept away by trailers of drones such as the DJI mavic pro, but wasn't ready to invest that much in the drone scene yet. This is a great starter drone to learn the basics of flying, hovering, fine-tuning, and recording videos. The video feed looks a little stretched on a Samsung Galaxy S7 but it connects without problems. Because of its light frame, it easily gets pushed around by the wind so I haven't flown it too high in the sky yet. Make sure to read the manual before first setup to learn best practices of drone handling and watch some YouTube tutorials! This drone has inspired me to get into the drone scene and maybe eventually buy a DJI mavic pro
4	Family game night fun for everyone
4	Fixed my A/C problem
4	It does the job perfectly. Wide angle view. Video quality for day time is very good. There are some lines on the video at poorly lit places. 400gb storage is a nice feature.
4	Bought this for my wife, she said it's very useful
4	I like the weight and thickness of the curtains.
4	Price was nice and installation wasn't hard either.
4	I would rather have OEM style but these were cheaper and got the job done, some edges were a little wavy, and some pieces overlapped where they shouldn’t have. Made it work though.
4	It's a cute top, the type of fabric makes it kinda clingy. I ordered an XL. That took care of it. Very cute.
4	This is my toddler son’s favorite stacking toy since it builds so high and he loves to knock them down. It is great for working on his hand eye coordination and size comparisons while having fun. My only complaint is that he once put the corner of the box in his mouth and it made the finish come off of the box. The boxes are sturdy and have held up to my son’s rough playing. They will change shape or get messed up if too much weight is placed on them though.
4	Thought it was one piece all the way across but it is 2 short pieces that still work.
4	Quality is lacking. But great price. You will have to wait quite a while to receive it. Overall a good value.
4	This is the second one I buy, I really like the color and the look of it. The only complaint is that it is slightly crooked. It is not completely straight, but it holds my movies and cds good. The other thing is that the adjuster moves very easily and sometimes the movies fall. Other than that a pretty good product.
4	Sized up based on others reviews. Fit as expected, wished to leg opening were slightly wider at bottom, same width all the way. Just preference I don’t like feeling like my shorts are clinging. Also the French terry is much heavier weight than anticipated and would be to warm for summer
4	It does what it's designed to do.
4	Arrived on time. Same great quality one expects for Write Socks.
4	Up to this point I’ve only used vogue and another similar product, and this tomato powder for soup is so superior to the others there’s no comparison. It even makes a passable tomato cream soup with milk.
4	Great texture no shedding wish it was a smaller cap
4	Very sturdy and looks great.
4	Buy one size up because it shrinks in the wash but other than that it does the job
4	Very comfortable shoes.
4	Who has never felt ungainly, strange or generally hindered when identifying with other individuals? I much of the time recommend this book to my clients who have summed up strain, unreasonable pressure, solidify strikes or social anxiety. This guide certainly rolls out you think and improvement something in your life to rest easy and live more joyful. The guide has totally gainful tips how to break free and assemble certainty.
4	This product was easy to assemble and so useful to dry my cooking items. The amount of space i am able to save is amazing. The only issue was it barely was big enough to stand over my sink but good enough for me to keep.
4	The socks are a good gift for people who like Harry Potter.
4	Well written, good characters who I really want to know more about. And Big Jeff is exactly the type of guy I love having for a friend.
4	Product as described.
4	Some relief from bugs. I guess.
4	A little tight over my head. But otherwise great. The material over your ears is soft, blue tooth connects easily and battery lasts a long time.
4	Replaced my original battery in my Samsung S5 due to shortness of battery life. The very next day after charging, I found that the phone had fully been restored and the life of this battery more than doubled.
4	Quick shipping but didn’t fit exactly for my Gigi warmer but I just had to cut it
4	I have only had these a few days, and I’m impressed so far. Yes they have to be cut and programmed however , I was able to get a local hardware store to cut them for 3 dollars a piece and since I did not have 2 original keys, I had to take to a dealer to program. They only charged 77 plus tax for as many as I wanted so I in turn bought 2 more keys and had 4 done. Granted since you don’t buy the key from them they can’t guarantee if they will work it kinda bites but for less than cost of one key at a dealer I was able to get 4 with a little leg work. The only reason for not all 5 stars is I don’t know how study they are in long run for durability they feel just like the original.
4	This is my second Torras case, I love this phone case but for some reason it cracks and breaks really easy. Catherine a representative I spoke with asked for a photo I have attached a photo below, I hope to see this case upgraded and hopefully more reliable in the future! Thanks!
4	Once we finally got this shelving unit up, we love the way it looks in our bathroom! But getting it up there was no easy task. The instructions are pretty much useless, we just looked at the amazon picture to put it together. Also, use your own wall anchors! The wall anchors it comes with are terrible and when we started to put the screw in the anchor slipped right into the wall. Would have been super helpful if it came with some sort of drilling template too. 4 stars for the hassle of getting the shelves up there but they do look good!
4	Stitching that connects band to bralette fabric I does not stretch, which does not make it the most comfortable, but still a great bra.
4	These are strong and won’t bend or damage easily. Polished copper colour looks so classy
4	Great dress. Comfy, fit well & looked great in my daughter!
4	buttons fell off during the first wear of this romper
4	Used around home windows. Serving its purpose. Now all we need is to get security system with cameras and surveillance going
4	I am very pleased with my purchase. The quality is great. It is a perfect learning tool as well as decorative.
4	Better than expected!
4	Really enjoying this mix of throwback music.
4	Not sparkling, but my grill was in bad shape. Worked as expected.
4	I like the product. It is sturdy and serves it purpose. I like the storage compartment also. I am disabled and homebound. I use the tray in my bed. I like to store a silver ware set and napkin in the compartment.
4	Pros: -Good manipulatives to spell out words - consonants in blue, vowels in red - choice of letter y as blue or red (I use blue) - has variation of letter a and g to familiarize students - a good number of letters to use with a small group, differentiated instruction Cons: -Overpriced -Plastic container would have been better with latches and a handle (like the kind used for screws, nails, or jewelry) - Take care to fully close the lid (hear it snap shut) or you'll find your letters spilling out like I did.
4	I like it but wich the mechanism fit tighter. the charger fits tight in the grommets, but the grommets are loose as hell. I might glue them in later but I really don't like using glue when a halfway decent hardware option would have sufficed.
4	Nice tape, easy to read in centimeters or inches, but it is too wide for the edge of kayak so I had to cut it down to size, fast shipping
4	It's a great cookbook with lots of helpful recipes. But honestly, most of them you can find online. Overall, it's a good buy.
4	These crocks are very comfortable, however I had ordered a size 8 (which is my normal size) and had to exchange for a size 9. Luckily, they offer free returns which is great. The color was exactly what I wanted!
4	It's a good game but after the last update it won't work. Please fix it!
4	This was obviously aimed at electricians, my first thought was why doesn't it take the double sided driver tips? Instead of pressing a button to turn it on, you twist it. That's not a very good way to use it, a button would've been easier with the twisting having a lock function to change direction. Perhaps the best thing about this screwdriver is the fact you can charge it via USB. That's the reason I got it but I am debating returning it as it falls short in every category. My black and decker I got for 18 dollars is more ergonomic than this, even if they have a proprietary charger. Edit: I just used this on a jobsite all day and I have to say, the twisting didn't bother me as much as I thought it would, the led light is perfect, and although it doesn't take double sided bits I can forgive that as it chargers via usb. I don't think it's worth $30 but it is not as bad as I originally thought.
4	I bought this for a photographic trip as I usually get eaten alive and thought it would work well. Haven't left yet, but will review after wear. Looks good, fits well and no issues.
4	It's a great product, period! I love the clip and the leather makes it high end looking.
4	It didn't work for me but my husband will be able to use it.
4	The bag is lightweight and has zippered compartments. Love that the wallet attaches to the inside of the bag. Great for me as I an in a wheelchair and cannot pick up stuff if I drop it .
4	I removed a star because this case is beginning to fray at the edges, but I like this case because it keeps my paperwhite slim while still providing protection, and the style is simple but elegant.
4	I would have given 5 stars but the price wasn't much of a savings relative to local stores.
4	Very cute dress for the price.
4	Wasn’t as big as I was thinking but works and looks great.
4	So far this grinder is worth the money. It grinds coffee appropriate to the grind size setting, is not overly loud, and is easy to clen after use. The way the bean container screws on to the base is a questionable design. It works but the threads could be cross threaded easily and I had some difficulty getting the top to click with corresponding grind size out of the box. Once assembled the 1st time, reassembly was straightforward and the pieces appeared to "fit together" better. The unit leaves some static with the leftover grind dust, but this seems common with all disc burrs, the collection container is easy to remove, empty, and clean. All in all, I would purchase again given the price point vs other similar disc burr grinders.
4	It’s good product and way better than sticky role, still I expected the plastic cover quality to be better than this
4	The salt gains are a bit too large and I had to put it in my blender
4	Works great! Better than just a PW wand, but not as good as a surface cleaner. Used it on a small area of a tennis court.
4	This is a fantastic product for sensory stimulation and fidgeting! However, don't expect this product to last for the long haul. I have had one of the balls pop already. With that said, I would buy these all over again.
4	Cute cap really like it. Fits my 4 month old well. Label stained the cap on first wash. I always wash my baby wearable products before use. So remove the brown label before you wash.
4	THE PRODUCT IS WELL MADE AND IT CAME A PROMISED BUT I JUST DIDNT CARE FOR IT.
4	Very nice product no issues putting it together. Everything is solid metal. Not sure why anyone would complain about a plastic screw holding the lightning jack. It allows for stand to adjust to your case to fit on to it. Easy enough looks nice. Cords not being built into or power is a plus in my opinion. Easy enough to replace a bad cord in the future.
4	Nice reusable cover, but difficult to fit around the heal of his cast due to the large diameter of the cast. Would love to have the choice of a regular size, or extra large.
4	So far I am really loving this product. I’ve used it twice since I got it and I haven’t had to reapply yet. The only issue I had was that one of the bottle came with a cap and the other didn’t. So it’s hard to leave one at home and travel with the other one.
4	Can’t speak about durability yet but they’ve been very popular with the kids and have allowed us to play when dark out!
4	Great rod for the price and great feel. With the Stealth reel it’s a winner.
4	Such a gorgeous, whimsical set! Beautifully made. Pros: color is vibrant, smooth and even, no flaws. Easy to clean; hand wash or dishwasher. Fairly sturdy with normal use (someone bent the tines on a fork, not sure how or why lol). Cons: the spoons are odd sizes; one is very large and the other is like a baby feeding spoon. Still use them though. Receive compliments on them often.
4	I brought one for me to secure a door n then l brought one for my mother to secure her door n she like the barking dog sound
4	If security is a big concern for you then I would recommend this pack. If not, there are other packs out there that will be easier to travel with. Seemed that the lack of organization pockets would be nice and minimal, but found them problematic in practice. Never needed to take advantage of the security features so I can't speak to those so much. All in all it was not a bad pack, just felt it could have had a little more organization that is easily accessible from the outside.
4	This book is a amazing book for connect your relation. It can help you to maintaining your relationship.this book save you to harm effect of relation.i love it......
4	Perfect for her costume. Great for the price
4	Worked perfectly and was very easy to install. Keeps you from hitting the wall or other car. I hope it lasts as it seems rather flimsy.
4	Only take away is that you have to charge the keyboard. On the new Zagg models you don't have to charge as it draws from the iPad itself. It is great for the price!
4	My son has severs disease and has a lot of heel pain especially playing sports with cleats. These have really helped. Even ordered a second pair so he could keep one in his regular shoes and one in his cleats.
4	This waffle iron is messy. It leaks out easily, which I expected but super hard to clean off once it does. It leaks through the crack in the back of iron where you can’t clean. There is a slide botton to let you choose the darkness or lightness of your waffle but it’s loose and flimsy. No matter which setting I use the waffles come out super soft. I’ve changed recipes thinking that was why but I get the same results.
4	the product is definitely versatile and good idea to keep around for any family accident. keeping ours.
4	Very easy to install. The only challenge was linking to my wireless. When they say place the camera near the router they mean very near. I had the camera in the same room and couldn’t make that initial connection, until I placed it inches away. After that the wireless connection was fine anywhere in my home. Great product, no monthly fees.
4	Bought for husband and brother they both like them for work and hunting.
4	Pretty flimsy, but does the job.
4	I use this as a replacement water filter for my built in kitchenaid refrigerator. Installation is easy and this fits perfectly into the water filter slot in the bottom of my fridge. You need to run the water for a bit to get the bubbles out of the system and the water will be cloudy with bubbles until this happens. Usually I need to run it for about 10-15 minutes before it clears up and the water is then very clear. I have been using this brand for years and never had any problems with leaking and the water always tastes fresh and clean. Hope that helps you decide what to buy.
4	It arrived on time and fitted perfect
4	In all my years of buying from Amazon and all the packages I’ve ordered, this was packaged with the most care. It was like opening a present. A little pricey but I’m glad I supported this company.
4	I like the way it makes my hair feel. I'm not sure if it really helps keep the curl have only used it a few times. Will know more as time goes one.
4	Just gave this to my year old for Christmas. She loves it. My complaint is that the cutting board does not make any chopping noises like it says it's supposed to
4	Worked well. Very compact for traveling.
4	This doesn't look or feel like an expensive pillow but the price is right. I just needed some stripes to go with more expensive pillows I bought for outside. I tend to use the same pillows and get covers to match the season and this is what I was looking for. I can't say much about the colors because I bought black and white stripes!
4	I was looking for an alternative to regular tortilla chips, and these fit the bill. I do get a slight aftertaste, but it's not enough to make me stop eating them. I won't purchase again because six bags are excessive for one person.
4	This was a gift and sent to a different address so I never actually saw the case. However the person who received said it fits fine. Sorry, that’s all I can say.
4	Looks great, not sure how protective it is though. The edges could've been higher
4	The install was pretty straight forward, however, all the pieces are held in place with adhesive. I’ve noticed that the adhesive doesn’t work as well on slick surfaces. I wish there were holes for a screw mount option. I’ve had this kit installed for over a year now. I’ve had a few pieces get pulled off.
4	Fits in YETI straw top, but a little tight. Hard to stir smoothie.
4	Thank for a good product
4	There isn’t a remote control on this version, very noisy but does give you adequate air
4	This top is soo cute! I wore it on a date to a bar and I was getting multiple compliments about the top from the women there. I am a big girl and it made me feel beautiful. I will definitely buy another one.
4	I only gave four stars because the fabric that lays over the top edge does not extend very far down. If you machine wash this I would recommend air drying flat or hang drying. When I dried it in the dryer it got so wrinkled I needed to iron it and there is nothing keeping the center seam stitched down where it folds over the carrier. Other than that it fits onto the carrier fine. Does what it states.
4	I purchased these lights to show steps on my patio for a grad party. Don't want visitors to trip and fall. Not proper use I know but great last minute solution to potential problem.
4	Full set with carrier as a great starter kit.
4	I love this lotion! It’s thick but not greasy at all. It smells great too. I would’ve given it 5 stars except for the bottle. It’s a fight to get this stuff out of there. I store it upside down and just take the top off, then I squeeze a glob out. It’s easier to work with that way. I was afraid I would crack the bottle if I kept squeezing it with top on. Basically it would be perfect if it came in a tube.
4	I love the material of the cloth...just not the thread used for stitching. I have one specific area that pokes and itches me so badly and I have tried to cut it down but I can't get enough of the thread therefore this bra is useless to me.
4	Not bad for the price
4	As I get older, my flow gets heavier. This has been working well for me. My cervix is so low, I tried to find the shortest cup I could. I had to trim the pull off. I have to cup it around my cervix and it still sits on the vaginal opening. I would rather tolerate that than chance overflow which has embarrassed me many times. It does have a learning curve, but it's not hard to learn and I do not find it hard to remove and clean. I recommend this over tampons anyday!
4	It’s a lot flimsier than I had expected. It’s not a product that could withstand much wear. Descent for the price and looks nice. Does not fit the generic 2oz acrylic paint bottles on lower two shelves which is disappointing for me...but also not what it was made for
4	If you've been searching for this style of glasses, then these are your best buy. Definitely gave me that 'Pinterest' look I was going for, and didn't have that cheap "gold" look.
4	Liked it very much except it is REALLY BIG. Not going to fit under any airline seat, this is as big as a carry-on suitcase. Returned for the Iconic Compact Weekender Travel Bag, which worked very well as my personal item and did fit under the airline seats.
4	Very durable, comfortable and easy to clean. Looks great on my wicker loveseat.
4	Great chair. I bought it for 11year old daughter for her bedroom. Only negative is that it sheds a bit.
4	Decent decaffeinated coffee. Not as robust a flavor, but I think that's due to the nature of the beans that are typically used for this purpose. I'll order it again.
4	Cute summer time accessory with a beachy look. It's made out of a plastic type material, so you are getting what you pay for. The type of quality you would find at a dollar store. It is held on by a string material that I feel could break real easily if caught on something. but no sharp edges and is comfortable to wear. It's a pretty necklace and bracelet to add fun to any outfit. The only warning I would give is it is made for thin people. The bracelet and necklace are very small. To have a dangling effect as it should, it's only suitable for those with very small frames.
4	It’s a book. As advertised
4	Works a lot better than I expected it to, I expected to get entirely ripped off!
4	Want to burn music CDs from iTunes? This drive will fail. Want to watch DVDs using VLC Player? This drive won't play them. Want to burn a bunch of files, or read a DVD full of data - this drive is great. Want to burn a data DVD or a data CD? This drive will do it just fine, at 24x speed. If you want full function, then you need to run Win 7. It's not the drive's fault, it's just the Way Win 10 plays with the drive.
4	Getting used to them.
4	First used this as a sampler from a recent hospital visit. Really like the smell of it and glad it's not greasy!
4	Bought these to paint with acrylics. They took the paint well but were quite thin, so I had to put cardboard on the inside so the paint didn’t bleed through
4	The antenna looks great on the truck and is easy to install! The sun faded the color on it, but it looks better now. The only down side is the sound quality decreases with AM/FM. For me, it’s not a big deal as I listen to Sirius radio and Bluetooth music from my phone. Would recommend this product to everyone though!
4	FALSE ADVERTISING, Amazon says 2300 GPH and the manufacturer says 2000 GPH. In My Book, that's FALSE ADVERTISING! See attached scan of the unopened pump package.... Don't take this as a deterrent, running it a week, on a timer, for about 12 hours a day and it starts up and runs just fine. I have it in my small goldfish pond, about 750 gallons, with a lift of a little over two feet. I would buy it again, if it's still offered, when this one eventually gives up it's ghost. ( The 2300 GPH rating is for ZERO lift. )
4	The material on the backhand is breathable so I've never felt my hands get overly sweaty because I was wearing these. If/when the pair I bought has finally seen its last day, I'll be buying another pair of these.
4	I like it but you have to purchase the licence after trial to use download games.
4	Works well but not the best quality.
4	Returned because arrived handles broken off due to no bubble wrap only loose paper stuffed in a box 6 times the size of red stoneware. Lovely when seen but wILL rethink reordering it 'cause not made in France.
4	It’s okay for what it is. It’s not very heavy but gets tangled easily. I do recommend it for a costume.
4	These worked out great
4	It is missing one star because it does tend to streak really bad but it is not a terrible product.
4	This mystery was fun, with an interesting twist
4	The print looks a little cheap but I got this shirt for a one-time thing. My biggest complaint was the smell. Straight out of the packaging it smelled like straight vinegar. Had to wash a couple times for the smell to fully go away.
4	I use this product for strengthening my upper back and arms. I only use the heavy band and it works well. I doubt I’ll use the other two weaker strengths.
4	Good goggles...but I left them outside and the tint is starting to discolor...comfortable...
4	NEW TO ME RIGHT NOW BUT LOVE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH TV SHOWS AND MOVIES WHEN I WANT TO. I'M ONLY AFRAID THIS NEW PASTIME WILL TAKE ME AWAY FROM WHAT I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF IN MY DAILY DUTIES.
4	Good for the money - but you have to use force to get them apart the first time. After that they're great!
4	Good heavy jacket. However, the bottom elastic band is very loose. Not very form fitting.
4	Just an ok curtain rod. Easy to install. Lightweight. Thin rods. Rods wall holders are easy to install.
4	Good hangers for the price. No damage and arrived on time.
4	Fits okay but does get uncomfortable after wearing all day.
4	My only gripe is that he doesn't have his Rivet Gun.
4	The states are dyed a variety of lovely colors, and are all fairly large. They arrived quickly, and were packaged efficiently. A few have flaws that I think might make them more fragile than I would like, but I am pleased with this purchase and would order them again.
4	So far so good, Goes on easily, goes on dry, feels kind of like a powder. Does not leave an oily residue or leave my pits feeling moist all day like others I've tried. I ordered the white lavender, goes on white but turns clear. Have only used 4 days at this point.
4	Works great! As a realtor I'm giving a flag with this light to ALL my clients!
4	Loved the pattern but was disappointed to find out this pattern was from 2010 and has been discontinued from Corelle so it's hard to find other coordinating pieces.
4	Helped calm down my senior dog. He likes the taste.
4	They are ok. Much darker than I expected them to be. But not thrilled with them.
4	Good power supply. A little noisy but worth the price.
4	This definitely runs small. When ordering your size, be sure to go off your waist size (inches) and not the descriptions of S, M, L, etc...
4	I have to wear shoes around the house for support and these fit the bill. Very comfortable very lightweight hardly know you have them on. If the price goes back down I think I'd probably get another pair.
4	Super cute, but I took one star off because it is see through and I was expecting a solid case.
4	I have use the light in different situations. It’s worked out well each time. For the light to be so small. It’s very strong. Having the remote is a plus. My plan is to get another one
4	Great little device. My only complaint is that it loses sync with my iPad and has to be removed and reinserted from time to time. That said, I’d buy it again because it works. Good for camera bag, etc.
4	Seems durable and good quality, except for the suction cups and adhesive. I will need to get something else to make it stick, they don’t work at all.
4	The color is an antique brass color, not the coppery bronze color shown in the picture. I went ahead and used them because the color won't show too much under the cabinet shelves, but I would not order more. They are the size described and they are strong.
4	Difficult to collapse
4	I like the size, that it clips on a belt or waistband. I wish that the volume control I set would remain fixed after I turned it off and turn it back on again. Unfortunately once you turn it off the volume level used it does not stick. When you turn it back on the volume is always at high
4	I liked this mystery until the end but I think that the language was the problem and for some reason I didn't realize it until near the end of the story. I liked some of the characters but could not give a higher star review.
4	Good curtains. Good quality. Color as described. Shuts out light.
4	I still have wrinkles.
4	This bag lasted for about 9-10 months before it started leaking at the velcro closure. The gap could not be closed because the fuzzy side had degraded and there was nothing for the hook side of the velcro to engage. I am satisfied given the price that I paid. The closure did not fail suddenly, but only after several months of service.
4	I enjoyed this book. It has strong,and intelligent characters. I really look forward to reading more books by this author.
4	Very lightweight, quiet clippers. Our son’s girlfriend is a pet groomer and said these will be great for trimming our dogs’ paw pads. Bottle of oil was missing from our package, not sure if that was supposed to be included but it looks like it was. Otherwise pleased with purchase. Great for pets that are scared of louder clippers.
4	Product was exactly as described. Easy to install. We did however get a bubble in the corner on our phones. But not enough to send back or complain. We are happy with our purchase, and the speed of delivery.
4	The instructions are clear and the installation process was the easiest I have experienced. The cover goes on right the first time. It seems to be good glass, but not that durable. I carry my phone in my back pocket and within only a few days the glass around the lock/ID sensor had become quite ragged. Otherwise the screen looks great and does not affect app operation.
4	Since this is my first pregnancy, I figure I’d buy this pillow to help me sleep as I grow. Saw the high ratings, so I went with this one. The pillow itself is comfy, but it’s so massive it’s hard to maneuver and get it in a position that’s comfortable to sleep in. The one night I did sleep with the pillow, I woke up with my entire side numb from the weight of my arm and the pillow. Think I should’ve went with a smaller pillow just for my legs and not this huge pillow that wraps around my head and neck. I mainly use it now to prop myself up to watch TV and for quick naps...perhaps when I get further along I’ll have more use for it, but for now it’s just at the end of our bed like a pet.
4	Great to find a christian themed shirt. I was a bit skeptical about buying online and this one turned out to be a bit smaller than expected. Ordered two others and those were Gildan which fit a bit better. I will buy from this seller again!
4	I ordered these for my husband. We ordered based on the sizing chart and they were too big. He needed them right away so we ended up returning. We would order again but would go with his normal size. Usually he wears and XL but the size chart recommended 2XL.
4	I got this because my husband always leaves the closet door open. Our closet is in the bathroom so I don't want humidity in there and decided to buy this. My only issue is that it doesn't actually close the door to the point of latching. It does keep it closed, just not all the way.
4	The design of the fan is great. 3 speeds. Easy to operate and not only can you wear it around your neck you can use it as a small desk fan. However, after a few weeks one fan stopped working. I tried a few things but couldn't get it to work. I emailed the company and within 2 days I was given a full refund. So, in my opinion, if you're on the fence about buying these there's some peace of mind that the company will do the right thing if you are not satisfied. I used my refund to by another pair.
4	This wallet is pretty cool! I have had it two weeks. It was a little hard to open the wallet to put in cards. It eventually got a little easier. The keychain is nice make sure it is screwed on there nice and firm.
4	Right size, very sturdy. My only complaint is that the included anchors and screws were not enough for all the brackets in the package. I was only sent enough for two brackets. So if you buy these planning to use more than two of the brackets, you'll need to get more anchors and screws separately.
4	I follow a link on Facebook to buy it. I only wanna have a try. To my surprise, its functions are so useful. Recommend it to DIYers.
4	Decent but the taste is about 3 stars. But beauty is pain right...
4	So.. this is pretty cool laser gun set. PROS: -accuracy and range is not bad -the sounds are pretty good -different gun settings. CONS: -you'll need more than 2 guns to make it fun -big play areas OR if you have tons of rooms in the house -back up batteries needed -reload button over time gets stuck (maybe manufacturing issues) -when you run out of life there's a long wait but you can always reset it turn on/off
4	Great product the only thing u would like would be for it to come with a holder so I can place it next to my sink. Aside from that it's a very sturdy brush and love the extra long pipe brush it came it, very helpful for bottle cleaning.
4	We’ve been using it for > than 2 yrs and have been very satisfied. I’m disappointed that the 10# bag is no longer available. The 25# bag is too large and will go stale before we can use it all
4	Super cute! I ordered for my daughters 21st birthday! She loved the lace! She wore it out that night when she went out with her friends to celebrate!
4	Wish it had more for the price but my rating doesn’t reflect the quality of the flavor...just the quantity. Especially since so many of the star anise was broken apart so I could only use so much. Oh well, that’s why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars; convenience of online shopping
4	Some plants have stickers and leaves that cling to the fabric portion of the glove.
4	I had my eye on this caddy tray for quite some time. I love to soak in the tub for a couple hours, and if you do too, this is a must buy! I love this tray! It also looks very nice. The only con for so far is that it leaves gray paint stuck to my tub where the ends sit. I definitely recommend this caddy tray!
4	I love this bag because it's just what I need! It's like a small duffel bag and has lots of room and it's made of waterproof material which is great for rainy days or just wiping clean. It's more on the casual side so it's not for date night but most definitely an everyday carry all!
4	It's a little noisy, especially at night
4	This 300+ page light reading presented important info re the very serious subject of "casual" tween/teen sexting and the legal implications these families can find themselves in as a result of a seemingly carefree, juvenile practice. Enlightening!
4	I made my own after going thru it fairly quickly. Bought a gallon of orange citrus oil, add water and a little methylated seed oil (or dish soap). Made 4 times the amount for the same price.
4	Tough toy. Dog loved it.
4	Good read. Enjoyed the plot, but too many characters with similar names. If you don't read this in one sitting, you forget who the folks are and have to go back and reread. Anyway, it was an enjoyable book.
4	haven't worn them much yet. They seem okay. Love the heel.
4	Durable, but very tight.
4	Was having fun until they said update and there's no way to do it
4	Does what it says it does and after 4 months of use - remote still works and product is working good.
4	Like that they have aloe in them
4	Another one of Craig Johnson’s surprise endings! I love horses and he wrote a lot about them in this book.
4	Seems like a great prod/
4	not enough noise maker
4	I have long toes and they still fit perfect I have not had them long enough to know how durable they are.I wear toe-shoes all the time
4	When the top surface gets worn you can flip it over to extend its use. Very much recommend. I have to buy two at a time or they will fight for the privilege of scratching/sitting/sleeping on it.
4	Haven't used it yet. Grades based on only practicing with it a little.
4	The slider to close the bags are a little hard to slide
4	Good quality, easy to install but not exactly as pictured. Looks droopy. Is this correct ? Can it be adjusted ? See picture.
4	This is a great read. The characters were more than believable (unlike most books in this genre). It seems I was connected on an emotional level from the first chapter; part of this is due to having lived in Texas. But it's fun, accurate, and deadly. The trafficking cartels have corrupted almost everything. In the book Tom Moreno, is threatened by the cartels and it could destroy everything he loves. I was pulled into this book's plot with ease and also fell for the underlying love story. I'm thankful authors like Ryan Lawrence can publish on the Kindle platform!
4	Everybody loved this hat, random strangers coming up asking you buy it
4	Very nice looking screen protectors! Looks really nice on the phone and still looks very clear.
4	Worthwhile read accounting for the trials of World War II in the Philippines. Not a spectacular narration but a good tale.
4	I managed to get this overnighted for a date night! I was really worried if it would fit or not. The dress got here just in time and overall it was beautiful! The dress does need to be steamed and the material is a little strange feeling but not uncomfortable. I got the small even though the chart said I needed a medium. Super glad I got the small because the medium would have been too big. I’m 5ft 3 and 125 lbs. I don’t know how long the dress will last as the zipper is a little fragil but other than that it’s awesome. When my boyfriend of 2 years came to the door to pick me up, his jaw kinda dropped to floor and he was speechless lol. Score! The dress is conservative yet super sexy in a classic way! Success for $25 bucks! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the sizing chart inaccuracies.
4	These appear to fit a bit smaller.
4	It’s better used for short bursted workouts but it does slightly shuffle around after extended use.
4	We purchased this for our young daughter as she absolutely loves it! The animals prints are very cute and the set itself seems very well-constructed. The only drawback is that the cardboard material which makes up the carrying case is not particularly sturdy and does not seem likely to last being played with.
4	The material used for this item is very nice. It looks kind of like the picture, it doesn't have the little frowny mouth thing though. I expected it to be a little bit bigger but that's not a big deal. The biggest problem I had with it was it was delivered to the wrong house.
4	You could make them small, medium, or large. They were exactly what I needed. I still had some left with air in them 2 weeks later.
4	Used it to install a BOSS stereo, had to use a file to cut some parts down (the kit is a set of general pieces where you remove/cut off certain parts to get it to the size for your specific vehicle). The instruction manual is somewhat confusing to follow along with at first but once I got the hang of it, everything went smoothly.
4	Pretty much exactly what I wanted. Later I may go for something more elaborate but for right now it'll do.
4	Decent moisturizer, it's a little weak for me I must admit. I like my moisturizer less watery. But still gets the job done. I would recommend something with a thicker consistency for dry skin.
4	I bought these for my husband and boys to use when taking our dog out during the winter. They are very warm and have a sturdy outdoor sole. Worth the money, and my guys tell me that the fit is perfect.
4	This is pretty but it is very thin. It would be perfect for a summer evening with a chill in the air but if you want it to keep you warm in the winter? Well it won't.
4	Christmas gift for my son. Works great and is fast! Unfortunately the battery pack connection was a little difficult for him and he broke it after a few days. Connection is similar to a cell phone with tiny prongs... he broke the prong off. Overall great gift, just wasn’t suited for him.
4	The lidocaine is not much help but does cut the lasting burning down a bit. I liked it
4	This is a great product! I love that it is adjustable and sturdy. It does NOT move once in place, unless you force it. The fast charging is very fast, I'm quite impressed! Most vent clips damage your vent, however this design does NOT. I was sceptical about this bc of my past vent clip I do not regret it at all. Why 4 starts....? bc I cant use it with my pop socket 😭 truly is a great product if you dont love you popsocket.
4	Not bad for the price
4	These noodles are delicious! I wouldn't consider them as spicy as the 2x spicy noodles however it was bearable spice level to one that usually consumes/desires spicy foods.
4	Great appearance. Drawers glide easily.
4	Small but easy to use.
4	BECAUSE SCREEN PROTECTOR IS NOT ADHERED TO PHONE, THE SPACE LEFT CAUSES TOUCHSCREEN TO NOT ALWAYS WORK, SO END UP REENTERING INFORMATION. DECIDED TO REMOVE THE PROTECTOR SHEET AND NOW THE CASE IS EXCELLENT. RECOMMEND BUYING SEPERATE SCREEN PROTECTOR THAT ADHERES TO PHONE FACE FOR BEST TOUCHSCREEN AND STILL HAVE PROTECTION AGAINST DAMAGE. LOVE THE CASE ANYWAY.
4	I have used a couple of other probiotics and switched to this one because it is way more reasonably priced. I can't tell if the probiotics by themselves are helping my stomach issues, but I definitely have less bloating and constipation than I used to. In the past, I was constantly miserable. These days, I am feeling a lot better. I will continue taking these probiotics for sure.
4	Curtains arrived on time. Great curtains, bought to decorate my li'l one's nursery wall. Not as sheer as I would have wanted but overall good!
4	Beautiful case. Fits well. I did have to remove the case when plugging a speaker jack into the bottom so I ended up switching to a different case, however I do plan on using this case again in the future. The texture of the back of this case can be slippery just because of the materials used.
4	Work better than I expected it to be.
4	The battery was able to charge my iPhone 3 times before needing to be charged itself. The battery itself took about 16 hours to charge. Overall it worked how I'd expect a portable charger to work. My only issue would be the lack of color but that is just an aesthetic critique.
4	I apply concealer first and the product really stays on and the color pops.
4	Thick, light and good size but just little hard to clean. Awesome graphics and colors!
4	I enjoy reading love stories and historical romantic fiction in my retirement. i chose these book (all three of the St.James siblings' stories) because I like also to see where the characters' stories go after the conclusion of the book. So far as the storyline was concerned, it was really good, as were those of the other two siblings, but I didn't think the episode of explicit sex when David and Vivi finally come together was necessary. And I thought it disturbed the tapestry of emotional and social upheaval that Beck had created. She did this in the other two sequels as well. I would caution those contemplating the book to go with the understanding that, if explicit sex bothers you, dont buy these!
4	Bulbs seem very good, but WOW are they ever bright. Too bright for wher we bought them for but believe they will work in Garage.
4	This worked out very well. I used to use numbers of pillows at the end of the bed, but with this it so easy. Now I do not have to worry of kid rolling over the bed. Its amazing how small things like these make life easier. And the material is awesome. the bottom of pillow has tiny protrusions that help it grip the bed, I guess gives more friction.
4	I bought this for 3 and 5 year olds for 5 hour car trip. They were a hit. Glad I could buy two colors without one of them being pink :-).
4	Enjoyed this book. Interesting characters. Lots of twists and turns.
4	Nice color, very plush.
4	I love the glasses. but I got no case. and after 5 broken English emails I am not sure if they are replacing it or not. We will have wait. the glasses are all metal framed and are just great. Not to dark that you come inside and run into things. they just make everything really nice. I just had eye surgery and needed some glasses. now I do. And with free returns you cant go wrong test driving them. I tried the blue ones too but didn't care for them.
4	This sits on a stand I picked it up by the stand and the stand broke
4	I like that the product has lots of room for shoes but the way it is supposed to adhere to the door (or wall) is ineffective. The tape included isn't very strong.
4	Super comfy, large pockets. Just make sure to wash according to directions before wearing or the black might transfer.
4	Kick stand snapped off within 5 minutes. Overall thr case itself seems pretty durable though.
4	This helps me get designs straight.
4	Discolored quickly - has a grayish brown think after a while
4	very helpful for receipts
4	My son is a newborn and this was the only type of pacifier he liked. He is breastfed and it’s important to me to have a pacifier that he won’t get nipple confusion with. This product is perfect for this problem. I bought this set to add to our collection. We have 6 of these pacifiers, but for some reason we lose them all at once. I previously bought a holder that required me to put the loop through the pacifier hole. That means the fabric of the holder was against my babies face. I can’t imagine having wet fabric pressed against your face being comfortable. When I found this model I jumped on buying it. I will warn you that the holder is translucent and is already attached to one of the pacifiers. I didn’t realize this and thought I threw it away. It’s easy to take off and more to another one. I absolutely love it. I took a star off because the clasp is just so bulky. I wish I t was a bit smaller because against a little baby it takes up most of his torso. Other than that I highly recommend this product.
4	I was very pleased with the tumbler. The overall look of it wasn't super eye catching but we are big golf fans here so the simple design and logo are still appealing to us. (wish it would be available in multiple colors, though) The lid was easy to take on and off. The part of the lid that you can open and close was great! It closed completely and securely which was much appreciated! No leaks! Most importantly, the tumbler kept my coffee hot for a much longer period of time than any mugs that I currently own. This will be great for the cold winter months! The size was just right and it fit in my vehicle's cup holder without any issues. I'm excited to try it for cold beverages, too, just to see if it can out perform the tumblers that I was previously using. My only real complaint is that it's not dishwasher safe. I know it's a higher quality tumbler and made of stainless steel but it can be a pain to have to hand wash at times; especially when I'm in a hurry! Overall, this is a great product, though, and one that I would definitely recommend!
4	I love this brush. My only suggestion would be to re-engineer the lid to a more durable material. It breaks and does not stay snapped fairly quickly. I would create a stainless steel design for the whole tool and make it worth buying. Or, sell the replacement lids separately as parts for .25 cents. It currently is only worth abou $19 to my thinking because of how often it needs to be replaced.
4	I liked that this was a small item and that it plugs into any outlet. The sellers are fanatical about making sure the item works and that you are satisfied with their product.
4	Helps offset overall redness but you need to use a lot since it doesn't have a lot of pigment. I still prefer that over some of the other green color-correctors I've tried. A little green goes a long way so the lighter color is safer to apply, especially if your foundation isn't high-pigment to cover up the green tint. I end up using more but at this price it's not a big deal.
4	They are soft enough for a baby or toddler with a few teeth, without being messy.
4	Fit easily on my face and very comfortable
4	It's a nice sleek phone case but I don't think it would hold up if I were to drop my phone with it on.
4	I purchased these pens and I do love them. However, the dark green pen came completely dried out.
4	I really like this phone. Amazing value for the money. My only gripe is the video output only goes to 720p. Won't find better for the price. I highly recommend.
4	Love the kettle so much I purchased a second one. Wish this vendor was Prime. Ordered white version and received ORANGE so have to waste my time dealing with return.
4	Really soft but absorbent. Very tiny I thought they’d be longer. Over all good buy!
4	500+ TDS before installing the APEC water system.We primarily use it to test the performance of our under sink RO filter.
4	My great niece loves her princess tent! So girly, so cute, you should buy this!
4	So far she I loving it so much. Will give an update in a month on how it's holding up.
4	Thicker fabric than another set I ordered from Amazon.
4	I thought this was a decent continuation and enjoyable read. This book clears the stage for the next challenge of Victory - Lisa Meyers. I also would like to see more of the new man exploits. I gave this a 4 star because I think the battle scenes could have been better.
4	fit wa a little tighter than expected of other Sketchers styles I've bought in the past.
4	Thought it was red but was more burgundy
4	It was missing the shoulder strap.
4	I got it for my new phone, it is petty good but it is a little hard it is not soft
4	I love it, mostly. Just pulls out or pushes in with ease. And cleans really easy with piece of toilet paper. After having it for awhile now it does seem to wanna lean Instead of staying straight up and down with the sink. It really doesn't effect it so I still like it alot. I have the tub one also and it now leans just like the sink one. Still a great purchase in my opinion.
4	These cards are lovely and quite sturdy. The envelopes, while cute with their stripes, could be a bit thicker. The small sticker strips are sometimes hard to remove. Overall, good product I would buy again.
4	A nice inexpensive kit for drilling small holes.
4	Worked well but hose bibs a bit longer than replaced part.
4	This battery lasts a long time and is reliable.Just don't care for the price. However, I did find the best price for it here.
4	They are wider but no more absorbing than the regular overnight pads. They are ok though!
4	I just started the game and it feels fun and I like the story.
4	This is by far my favorite hot chocolate. I am so happy I am able to get it online as they dont sell this brand in any store. near me.
4	Carefully packed to protect book. Arrive on time. A good simple transaction
4	The fabric is light & cool, it seems well-made, and fits almost perfectly. The docked ⭐️ is for two reasons: I can’t imagine this as one-size-fits-all (it’s almost too short, and I’m not a tall person so my arms aren’t very long); and the black one bled dye on everything it touched after *three* thorough washings. 🤞 for the fourth try.
4	There are a lot of tips on how to make the most of every day without having to live in stress and keeping up with the fast pace of the world. I learned that we all need to slow down at times, reflect and take one step at a time. I can say so much about this book. Highly recommended!
4	I bought another ecko shirt a week earlier and it’s the same size of 2x, but this one was way larger. I’m not sure why, but it’s longer and just overall more loose. I’m still going to wear it though, so it’s not that bad, but if I had to redo it then I would’ve got an xl instead of 2x. Like I said, the other one was 2x was perfect. Design is really cool and it’s just like it’s pictured.
4	Awesome read lots of twists and turns and visits to different realms and fairytale characters and some who you think of as good that turn out evil. Awesome storyline and love the variation of the characters
4	It meets my need, happy with the purchase.
4	Just received this product can't wait to see if it works for me stay tuned I will write another review once I've taken this for a few weeks
4	So tiny! But I really loved that about these earrings!! But I ended up losing the both of them after a month or two which I was very sad about. The backs constantly fell off, which was it's only downfall.
4	Early stages but so far it works well for my needs and what it holds. Nicely made
4	Cant as yet determine durability. Small bt seems solid
4	Bags are a pretty blue, but somewhat thin.
4	In two separate lots made in their February and March 2019 production runs, the hardware packages were short spring washers and flat washers. This necessitate a trip to the local home center. Otherwise the product was satisfactory.
4	Great price for a good quantity to stock up on. Unlike Amlactin or other exfoliating lotions this does not burn or sting even when used over areas with irritation or sores. Very hydrating but sinks in quickly. There is a slight smell, but it dissipates in a short period of time. Unfortunately my skin still has quite a few bumps after over a month of daily use, but there is a notable different in how much moisture it retains.
4	Nice design with plenty of room for large toilet paper rolls. Like that it has 4 feet so it’s less tippy. Only issue is the shipping package had too much room in it. It slid around in the box and bent all the feet. I straightened it out and it looks good now
4	Made my hair very soft and manageable but did not help my itchy scalp.
4	I haven’t had the chance to use this, yet. Surgery is in 2 weeks. It feels and looks well made. I have used one on my arm in the past and it was terrific. Hoping this is the same. The leg section is substantial. I am concerned that the top part that fits around my thigh may not be tight enough or strong enough. I’ll up date when I actually use it instead of just trying it on.
4	Very easy to put up especially by yourself. The only true drawback at this time is that it’s not very sturdy at the end where the poles are used. I use mine for my mobile bike repair business and when I use it the back end just falls to one side or the other. I’ll have to get some rope and weights to eliminate this issue.
4	Comfortable, higher waist to keep my booty in check. They’re very long though, I’m 5’7” and I need to cuff them. The only thing I don’t like is that the seams are quite prominent and can be scratchy. After a couple washes it was fine though.
4	Comfortable and thick material in a good way.
4	I hope this is working. I have not seen any snakes around this device. Hence my 4-star rating. They seem to be substantial and well made.
4	Worked as advertised within 3 days, I noticed the cold sores/acne that form around my lips seemed to go away. Not an instant fix but if you give it a couple of days and uses it will work. The tube is super small, and does not contain a lot of medication just fyi.
4	Light weight with heavy weight results. Too delicious
4	Comfy seat. Wish it was longer to better fit my car seat.
4	Like it, but I have to buy an extra cable.
4	I am really enjoying my new study bible. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it does not have the individual book tabs. The bible is offered with the tabs in a more expensive version which I would recommend considering for purchase.
4	works as advertised.
4	great taste; needs to be removed from frig a good while before use, otherwise doesn't mix well.
4	Detail for the mask was great. Used it as a costume for my son (pre teen) and it was a little big, but it states it’s for an adult. Reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the strong rubber smell. I washed it with soap 3 time, made a baking soda paste and used that 3 times. Finally I made a baking soda paste with essential oils and that made it to where the smell was tolerable
4	This is a very effective power bank, it has slightly less battery power than I wanted, but other than that, it's a great product.
4	Not the scent I had hoped for . Love the scent of cedar, but this one missed
4	This product has been great so far. The instructions were very easy to follow and the set had everything I needed to change out my old thermostat. I was intimidated by having to go into my furnace panel and change some wires, but the kit that was provided as well as the directions made it quite easy. The interface is friendly and easy to use. Great thermostat for the price, and the Alexa integration is convenient.
4	I would give it 5 stars, but it did not come with the promo card which leaves me to believe that it had been opened, card was taken out, then resealed. Everything else is great, just really would've liked to have that card.
4	The rest of the accessories are nice but the hat is small.
4	They were a little smaller than I thought they would be, but they are very bright and I love that you can set the motion detector and or dusk till Dawn sensor. Good product for a pretty good price.
4	I use this as a base for top ramen like noodles as I am a vegetarian. I'm happy I found this.
4	It is fine, I wish the color had been alittle different green to have better matched the toilet
4	The product was as I expected... Recomended
4	It's beautiful but way too long for a person my height
4	Little small but great product
4	Well packaged in Mylar sealed bag (wish it was resealable) lots of seeds and will update on germination rate and taste. I’m going to grow this in a hydroponic system. Stay tuned!
4	Scent does not last long but for the price it’s ok.
4	Love these, wish the leather was a little wider around the thumb and index finger. These do fit very well and keep my hands warm.
4	Good shorts, wish the material was a little heavier. Fit was good, followed the other reviews on sizing. Like the draw string.
4	The Devil horns were great for my Halloween project. Just beware there is no adhesive you will have to figure out what you want to use. For this I used a clear Elmers glue.
4	Great stocking stuffer. Hard to find item anywhere but Amazon.
4	Great price. Screw holes slightly off but unnoticeable once it's on. It did come scratched so that may bother you. I figured it'll get scratched when playing anyway lol. Again you can't beat the price.
4	Super cute! Well made and very soft. A lot larger than most other newborn clothes though, going to have to pick out another outfit for hospital.
4	I did not like the white ring on the outside.
4	Enjoyed the storyline. Wish there was more.
4	I love, love, love this jacket. I ordered a large it fit but I wanted room to wear a sweater so exchanged for an x-large. I gave 4 stars because the 1st one the large was missing a button, however the exchange was so easy and the x-large is perfect for me.
4	I like this design and the hex bits fit perfectly snug. I was able to get into hard-to-reach spots installing a motorcycle windscreen. But after light-duty use, one of the bits popped out of the handle--seems the bits are just press-fit into the handles.
4	I've only used them three times this past ice season, but I felt like I could've climbed Everest with them. Im gettimg to the age where if I fall I may break a hip (I'm not really THAT old yet). So far, I'm impressed and fracture free.
4	It is a beautiful wig.
4	I am size 6. I ordered it Large. And it doesn't fit. The large it is as a sizes 2. Is a beautiful skirt and great quality. But doesn't fit at all I returned it and I got xL, is a little big I need safety pin. But quility is perfect.
4	I love that it can combine all of my libraries, but there are certain movies, I think maybe Sony is one, that will not show up with this app. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for that. It actually plays my movies better than they play on the apps that I purchased them on.
4	Only used it once, seems good
4	The flavor of these capsules is surprisingly good. They could maybe be a little richer for my taste, but definitely a good substitute for Nespresso and much more cost effective. The most impressive is the crema! I think it’s better than most Nespresso capsules. I only wish the capsules were made the same way as Nespresso. They sometimes don’t give a consistent brew, but they are better than the last Nespresso compatible capsules I purchased.
4	I like the spray but please make sure that employees seal the top on better. My pkg was damaged and it waisted all over the envelope it was sent in because the top wasn't secured before shipping. Please make sure that never happens to another customer. The spray actually leaked through the plastic covering.
4	Nice quality product. Adhered and stayed on a large abdominal incision quite well. While difference is minimal when you simply touch it, the thickness (probably the reason) is slightly inferior to the highly rated Cica brand. This seems to stick onto itself at edges easier, however, you can peel it back out. In the end, the Cica brand is just a bit more comfortable and easier to use due to the tiny difference. However, I imagine if your wound is small, this would not matter as much. We preferred the cut your own length on this brand while the Cica has perforated preset lengths that you can tear off.
4	Once again the Green Riders are knee deep in intrigue and adventure. Second Empire is hounding the kingdom on multiple fronts and the clash of powers is deadly to many....I can't wait for the next one!
4	This is a good quality sturdy leak proof water bottle. The time markings make me disciplined about drinking lot more water than i used to. One minor thing i noticed - the time marker on the left side should have been 12 pm. Instead it is 12 am.
4	Makes a terrific gift at a reasonable price. My son uses it all the time
4	It looks real. I gave four stars because there were few paint scratches and peel on some of the fruit.
4	Pretty good headphones with solid audio quality. I have enjoyed its use for a few months but today one of the left ear speaker just broke on me. I was wondering if I could get a replacement. If anyone could direct me to the warranty department, that would be greatly appreciated. Can provide pics if needed.
4	good customer service
4	Fits nice and is a nice color, but it already was sticking to my iron as if it couldn't take the heat.
4	My band from Physical therapy broke after a year, so this is a replacement for me. Does slip around it you use the over the door attachment sideways - which my PT band did not.
4	Its a nice compact size for my sump tank with Protein Skimmer in it. And being all plastic except for the stainless screw to adjust the float level.. However it arrived with the float broken off... I was surprised even though I had read the same thing had happened off someone else reviewing it. Amazon was quick to replace it...So it does work..Just hoping it doesn't break and flood my house with water since it maintains my Sump Tank water level...
4	Enjoyable read with reference to Florence Nightingale. As a nurse I enjoyed learning about nursing in this era. Great characters.
4	Good product for the price. Can get very hot inside depending on where you live. Shelves need to be Ziptied down. Overall a nice place to keep some of my plants.
4	Very nice quality for the price. Arrived within 2 days. Pleased.
4	Grand daughter loved this toy!
4	The first was defective, and I emailed the company. They were responsive, polite, and sent a replacement immediately. Be forewarned when initially turned on it can suddenly get too hot which is the only reason to 4-star it. Otherwise, it's a 5 star. After months of daily use and abuse, it's working well and doing its job! The longer length allows me to wrap it around my knee or place it across the width of my back.
4	I ordered these hangers when they were on sale here on amazon & I really like them. I was going to order another set but the price increased drastically so I might be looking somewhere else which bummed me out. I used them to make personalized bridesmaids hangers for my wedding. Very easy to write on & decorate.
4	I am very happy .That just what I needed.
4	Great for comfort in that it’s soft. Drawback is that fog cannot see trough sides. Hence the four out of five rating.
4	Meet my needs and work great. They fit perfectly on my glasses and what I like most is that you can't see the cord hanging from the side of you face because they shorter than most sun glass holder cords. You can pick the size which makes for a perfect fit!
4	This gets hot after inflating the tires of one small SUV up to the recommended pressure for each tire. A bit of a bummer, because we have two cars. But on the plus side, it's cordless. Not having to take out an extension cord is a real convenience.
4	I didn't expect them to fit as comfortable as they do, they fit around leg and thigh area with less pain and I have a low belly muffin....C section scaring and they are comfortably soft and don't rub scar tissue red.... the fabric washes great and they have kept their shape and waist elastic really well......I even waited 2 weeks and bought the product again.....My body can breathe in east coast summer humidity which is great!
4	Gift. Seems to be good quality
4	The size is very small but was good for an infant who will begin walking or beach toy.
4	My son loves this toy. He said it was his favorite Christmas present. Looks just like the picture. My son is 7 and even though there are several small parts he has done well keeping track of them. Only thing is the helmet keeps coming apart but other then that this is a really nice toy.
4	It's a really nice, professional, sleek-looking backpack. It's smaller than I thought it'd be... still enough space for what I need it for but just smaller than most adult backpacks.
4	They appear to be good quality. They work good. I haven’t tried push them to the limit, but I will order another set for the house.
4	I bought this slipcover on a flash deal and that extra discount motivated me to purchase. I have to say... I am pleasantly surprised. Fabric is soft & durable. It was pretty easy to install and looks pretty good. My loveseat is pretty small so there was excess fabric I had to creatively conceal. Overall, this is an affordable solution to cover a piece of furniture. Would be great for homes with kids, pet owners, or folks on a budget that want to give their sofa an easy makeover.
4	Recommend for that retro feel
4	This book grabs your attention in the very beginning and keeps you captivated until the very end. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
4	The rear sight is to wide and needed me to put a thick shim under it so I could tighten it and make it snug. This caused the thing to not line up correctly to sight in. A problem I haven't been able to resolve yet. My mounting rails ,front and rear are standard and measure the same. I tried reversing the two sights and the front works anywhere as it should. The rear sight is to wide and will not tighten up to both sides of the rail
4	works well on paint removal
4	Great continued development of Charlie Moon and Scott Parris - great to encounter a mystery where there are really two lead characters - no sidekicks here. Excellent plot - hard to put down.
4	These are top of the line for the outer material. I had ordered a full size larger, this was way to much. I choose to return the slippers since they were to big and did not replace due to there is no cushion in the sole.
4	Fits well, quality fabric
4	I love this band! It is dressy enough to wear for work but also casual enough that I can just wear it around the house or running errands! I have noticed since I started wearing it that occasionally my iphone screen will go black out of no where or right after I unlock the screen. I think the magnet in the band has been causing issues with the phone making it inconvenient. Also, if you do any sort of lifting or carrying of objects, I've noticed that the clasp will easily be knocked off center of the band making me worried that it might fall off after getting loose.
4	Eat with some pecans and pretend it is divinity fudge.
4	Just what I expected. I'd buy it again.
4	A great book, just wish majoring of books are series. I want to read finish and not be left wondering what happened.
4	I had a cheap case and when my phone hit the street the case exploded, my phone went flying, and landed facedown. She hit and bounce very hard and the screen was shattered in some areas but my phone screen was untouched!
4	Searched youtube for some videos how to reduce the size. Takes some time getting used to but works fine.
4	This safe is exactly what I needed in regards to space-saving size, overall height and functionality. The fingerprint reader is good! I tried several fingers NOT loaded into the database and none could open it. Adding additional fingerprint access is easy. It was easy to attach to floor or wall and the hardware was included. I REALLY wish the power unit was behind the door/behind the fingerprint scanner (would be a 5-star review). You can't see this in the photos, however, or I might have kept shopping. The battery power supply is separate and uses a single plug into the bottom of the scanner. I leave mine plugged in, but it has come loose and fallen a few times. When I plug it back in there are two very loud "BEEP" sounds that I cannot eliminate or silence, which is a problem early in the AM when I'm the only one up.
4	Got this for a friend. He seems to like it. Said it was relatively easy to install.
4	Easy to use and clean. Recommended.
4	I recall the events, but not the true story. Enjoyed the movie.
4	I bought these bottles to use for homemade kombucha. They work great and I actually like the smaller 8 oz sizes. The tops are sometimes very hard to unscrew, which I suppose can be a good thing.
4	Great jacket, runs small. Going to reorder in next size up because I actually LIKE the jacket. Wish the size chart was more accurate.
4	I wore these under an off shoulder dress. The worked perfectly for that. Only reason I gave a 4 is because they irritated my skin. Other than that I recommend them.
4	I love this toy but I am somewhat surprised it's made of plastic when it takes so much abuse. It was a tiny bit bowed when I got it and I imagine that will only get worse with time. I do really love the idea of the toy, and my daughter enjoys it. But I think better materials could be used.
4	Absolutely love this product for intense moisture. I feel like my lips are softer and look fuller after a week of using this nightly. Thick, almost vaseline texture with no smell or taste.
4	It's not really kid friendly. Watch before allowing children to watch. Language and sexual situations. But funny for adults.
4	Instructions are a little vague , and not very intuitive. Website for update very slow. Requires PC, no MAC. But once everything got updated and I figured out the instructions, the unit works great.
4	Package was damaged, but item was ok. Not packaged properly.
4	Necklace is good quality. I wish there is an option for smaller pendant like 20mm, and 25mm.
4	Wanted a more structured boot
4	Works ok ,nice long handle ,it needs to have bend at head so it won't touch truck.
4	Although the scope was smaller in size than I expected. The view is clear, sharp and easy to focus. I found it important to start with 20 and the increase the power after locating the subject. I liked the fine focus located on the barrel of the scope. The smaller size has the advantage of being easier to carry while birding. I prefer my full size tripod rather than the included tripod.
4	I am 5’9” 150 lbs. It is a stretchy jersey like material. A little tight up top, but not an issue for me- i’m not busty. But the 4 stars is because the dress is shorter in the back than in the front. Other than that, I love the green color and it will look great with a sweater and/or scarf for winter :)
4	I love this T-shirt !! I collect them of places I have traveled to. The shirt is very nice, not a heavy Cotton like I’m used to. I purchased a 2xl according to the measurement grid they provide. It fit, bit had to do a little pulling and stretching. Size up if you like your tees to be a little looser. I kept mine and just love it.
4	I LOVE that this product is cruelty-free which is a must. It provides light-medium hold, with no stickiness at all, hair feels very smooth. Not as much hold as I'd like, as I have thinning, fine hair but I'm sure it would be great for those looking for less body/hold.
4	The shaver is well built and has lasted many years. The downside is that it takes many passes to get a smooth shave, and is therefore a bit labor intensive for tasks like shaving one's head. For just shaving your face, it would be fine.
4	Got this for Valentine's Day for my Hubby. Works perfectly considering the size. He likes it very much.
4	Pros: 1. Covers well 2. Material seems of good quality Cons: 1. doesn't look as tight and neat as I would have liked it to. 2. Takes a while to install, especially if you want it to look good.
4	Pattern doesn't seem as bright as pictured but still nice, love the theme.
4	plan on taking some time but adds lots off extra space
4	Good construction and I like the clip on the case where I clip it to my belt clip.
4	Great size...good for a quick spot
4	I thought the inside would be more entertaining and have more going on. its basically a picture and sayings in the middle. Its not mixed in or really a mandala inside at all. But it served its purpose.
4	This was a gift for my nieces. It's in their room as a night light they quite love it
4	Shower shoes for hubby. He says they work fine.
4	Worked great on my pool. It kept my pool warmer than it has ever been. This purchase was a replacement for this exact cover I bought a year ago. It's essentially a one year cover. Last year's cover was too brittle to use this year. But for the price, it's so definitely worth it. I'll just buy another one next year!
4	Although a bit flimsy the fit was good and is comfy looks nice. Has a nice long length.
4	These earrings are very very cute and super light weight. However, the post are SOOO sharp. I have an infant who loves grabbing at my ears so I can’t wear these as often as I’d like. He would definitely hurt himself
4	I am a pocket lover of dresses and skirts and this fits the bill, the only thing is it is cut in the front in a way that is shows some of my racerback bra.
4	While the box says Classic- this is not the game I remember playing as a kid. The pieces may be correct and the game board may be correct, but the houses/hotels, money, chance/community chest cards... they aren’t the same anymore. First of all we keep running out of money- and we’re only playing with 2 people! Then the houses are too big to fit 4 on a property and if you want to put 4 houses on more than 6 properties there aren’t enough pieces. I’m sure the cards/money have all been updated to new materials, but I loved the old card stock that was used. We are glad to have the classic version of Monopoly, but we definitely miss the classic feel to the game.
4	Good for Halloween and Christmas. Can’t wait to set it up for Halloween. It comes with different projection pic for Christmas and Halloween. Easy install. It has timer settings. You can use it either indoor or outdoor. It plays music too. The only thing I don’t like is when you turn it on, it plays Christmas song on a Halloween projection and there is no music downloaded for Halloween. The projection should have been scattered instead of showing one at a time. Not bad for Halloween though.
4	Awesome product! It’s cute and very functional my only complaint is I wish the hook on top was larger because it doesn’t fit on my rods. This picture is my bathroom shower rod granted it’s a sturdy rod. It’s the closest one that fits
4	The pillow is too plump and hard for my comfort
4	When the mattress pad came it was unzipped in its original plastic packaging. It was dirty. So I washed it and put it on the bed it definitely has a cooling effect to it. because I have a TempurPedic mattress it seems to hold in the heat this. my husband seems to think that it has made a huge difference for him. The fit for the king size mattress was perfect and it washed great?
4	The hair out of the pack is very soft & silky. Hair has a slight smell to it (hopefully it will wash out). The bundle are very thin. Im going to buy a scale because there is no way these bundles are 100 grams. I will be updating after wash then another after install! Update: I was able to wear this hair from mid July to early September. The photos show the hair from initial install to last week on use in order. Hair comes back to life after each wash but starts to get more and more tangles. The hair sheds like crazy the hair wasn't as full as I like but was well worth the price. I will buy again
4	Everything was fine just had to buy the line and connector to hold the shower head. But it works fantastic now I have all the parts.
4	Like the way they look while wearing them, but they are Very Fragile
4	It's a g2 belt, and it's good quality. Works great in my 3d printer, with lots to spare. Why are you smelling it?
4	Good flip case wish it would stay closed with magnets.
4	Using it for a raspberry pi. Although a might small for a older pair of eyes to read detail, it is quite good for IQ. It also will serve as part time monitor for a Roku in the spare room.
4	Using for small remote I keep outdoors. Waterproof, but I do have a condensation build up inside on occasion.
4	Two of the 5 rods were broken into several pieces upon arrival.
4	The thrills keep coming for Alex Vane. And I enjoyed this, since it is somewhat timely with the cybersecurity aspect. Not to mention that I work in the field. Made me not want to put it down.
4	I am a big fan of sketches of people and faces, but I am honestly quite terrible at mixing different realistic skin tones, especially if its as messy as watercolors. This is great for coloring practice really! And saves a lot of time even if youre a pro
4	Liked the different side options.
4	First of all.. I've read all the reviews. I had previously purchased some other brand chinese LED lights that did not work at all (there's three rows of LED on that one.. avoid them..).. I eventually settled on these even after reading reviews. At first when installing.. only 1 row on one worked, and both on the other.. the 1 with one row had a pin not connecting nicely (ground).. that was easily bent into a better position and fixed. I taped the connector once over with electrical tape, then used a flat head (with some struggling) to push the connectors deeper into the mirror one at a time. Making sure the lights are working I pushed the lens into the mirror, they DID NOT snap tight.. if I slightly pushed it they'd come out.. this was a no go.. what is happening is the latch on the LED lens is not seating itself.. so what I did is pushed it in all the way, and then on the mirror side (with mirror turned up and away) I used my flat head and forced the latch to seat itself (it takes some force, it won't break the latch) and once it's seated.. the lens isn't going ANYWHERE, highway, bumps or not.. so far so good. They fit and look GREAT. Just a little hassle with the wiring, and getting the latch to seat itself so they stay securely put.
4	just what we were looking for scooter
4	This is better than the seat covers I have purchased in the past. My family does a lot of road trips and that means we use a lot of bathrooms. These covers go on the part of the seat between the lid and bowl which means that you make no contact with the actual toilet seat. Now I can finally stop cleaning strange toilet seats to protect my girls from contacting nasty toilet seats. Wish I have found this product earlier. My children take these to school with them to use whenever using the 🚽 at schools and I can finally feel safe that they will not be sitting on any dirty toilet seats.
4	They are bright but mine are opposite my high beams point down instead of up.
4	Over all happy with my purchase. Not strong enough to crush ice but does it's job.
4	Very comfortable. Soft texture. Reclines without a problem and helps to assist to stand at appropriate height.
4	They were smaller than expected, but they work perfect, and the air stays in them for a long time. I mean months.
4	I am a very avid pokemon go player and play outside a lot! I needed a pair of gloves that would allow me catch those pokemon and these gloves are it!
4	I love this color and purchase it often, but this is the first time I have purchased from Amazon. The pro: it brightens up my face without being too sparkly and stays on all day. The con (and this seems to be exclusive to the Amazon version): it arrived in a much looser powder than the version I have purchased for years, in-store, which makes it messy to apply. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.
4	This is a good looking bird and it works well. Like most folks, I’ve had some issues with the tubing, but it is easy enough to change, came with extras, and is readily available.
4	they work fine, will see for how long
4	I have used this for a week and can already see a difference in my split ends. My hair look healthier! Helps control frizz! My hair has more shine then ever. Has a nice soft smell isn't overwhelming like most!
4	Works great on the series 1. The microphone holes don’t line up perfectly as I assume it’s designed for series 2 or 3 but haven’t noticed issue. Other than that it fits great and is well made and a good look. Only issue for me Is it is REALLY tough to push the band release button so if you change bands often you might be disappointed. It definitely works just pretty tough to get it to release the band.
4	The shirt would go too far up into the armpits area, but it was not something that was extremely intolerable.
4	Purchase these screen protectors with the camera. They were packaged nicely and easy to apply. They seem well made and should work.
4	This is well made, the kaleidoscope display itself isn't great, but it works.
4	Much bigger than expected but very nice and well packaged no damages or faults
4	if I gave a 5star this would be one but nothing is perfect-lol
4	Not bad for the price. Sound is clear and good bass. Battery kinda sucks but look at the size of it
4	Will never stay connected to WiFi and the app is pretty worthless. 0 times have I logged into the app and it was usable.
4	This wig has been great. It is a great lace front for beginners, because it's so easy to work with! The baby hairs and pre plucked hairline is a great bonus, the baby hair is a little long, so that you can cut to your preference. Because of its length it does tangle a little, but it was a great wig for a night on the town!
4	First thing’s first: this set is BEAUTIFUL. Everything shines perfectly in the light and makes all of the colors pop from the black covers. An amazing addition to any collection and to anyone who frequently plays the game, as these even have all of the updated errata to game rules. Whether it’s on a shelf or at the table, it’s gonna turn some heads. Now, onto the unfortunate bad. The printing of these editions clearly has had some issues, as I found minor ink stains in the spine on ~5 pages throughout all 3 books (The one pictured is the largest stain I found). The DMG also had pages that got folded up during printing which made them look like... that. Nothing which can’t be solved with a bit of cutting, but it’s still good to be aware of. There was also minor cosmetic damage to the outside of the box, but I’m not so concerned about that. If you get this set, inspect every page thoroughly for damages, but what you’ll be left with is a very special set of books!
4	Excellent Customer Service!!! the light its very bright and intense, the one I bought stoped working after a few months but they send a New one as soon as I told them!!! great Value
4	These towels are lightweight and dry quickly soft and pretty good quality for the price
4	I love how it straightens the hair,but i dont like the fact that it keeps locking as i flat iron.
4	Very stretchy. Falls to knee and I got a small and I'm 5'8". Needs wrinkle releaser or a warm iron after washing/drying.Zipper seems a bit weak and will prob go before I'm ready to part with this cute skirt.
4	Great value. I wish the tops were attached to the base. No leaks or issues. Perfect for my event.
4	Nice, compact case, light weight, and has a soft interior. Good price point and product. The soft fabric inside is great because it doesn't scratch my computer casing, however, I often find microfibers stuck inside the computer screen. I wish it had a small handle. Other consumers complained about the metal logo scratching tables/counters/surfaces. I have not experienced this problem and isn't a concern for me.
4	Turns out the chairs don't require any screws. It's super easy, there are literally four pieces that slide into each other through the use of tracks. We ordered in bulk for our conference room which is great because I'm the only person putting them together. I'm a little weary though because assembly is SO easy. How sturdy are they for the long run?
4	It looked more shinier in the picture and in real life it's not as bright
4	This is only for last minutes planning. You can get the same brand at Costco for double the quality you get here. This is a rip-off!
4	It was easy to setup even without a manual. It has a clear picture both night and day. The only negative things I have to say is that I wish the movement was in smaller increments and the two-way audio was a little louder. Even though I only gave it 4 stars I like it enough to buy another one.
4	Haven't used yet but seem perfect for indoor dodgeball
4	Fit is very good, it's comfortable, and looks good on my 65 year old fat bellied body
4	I think this is a bit better than the standard band
4	Make sure you order one size up. It’s a snug (good) fit. The fake fur collar was awful. Matted and not classy looking at all. The coat looks much better without it. Overall, a great buy.
4	Doesn't ring very loud. Have it set to high
4	At first I thought 'where is this going'? Seven pieces of the moon? Twists lead to understanding and time leads to a story I'm glad I stuck with. That's all so I don't give it away.
4	Very good self tanner!! Comes with everything for easy application!
4	I loved The dash diet weight loss Solution. Never hungry. I would recommend this diet. Also the menus are well rounded. Try it. Has lots of the information need thanks.
4	The older design was better, it provided more coverage of the screen as a whole. The new design leaves the glass above and in between the front facing camera and speaker exposed. This was my go-to screen protector, but I may need to find another.
4	Love this shower curtain! It spruced up my bathroom perfectly! Great material and great design. I’m so glad I purchased this!! Thumbs up!!!
4	nice look and temp seems rather accurate (I'm comparing with my older thermometer). one star off is the display seems a bit busy with all the max and min numbers which i haven't yet figured out what there the numbers relatives to.
4	but can see threw it and its flat not circled shaped i just put stretch shorts under neath that matched her shirt solid color
4	So far, I really like this product. In SW Florida you can be overrun with underbrush, especially on unoccupied lots. This is really good at cutting items that a chainsaw is too large for, and loppers would be too slow. One downside: I 'really' needed the included sheath with belt loop holder, well, the top of the loop just tore right out after 5 minutes. Unsure how to proceed with carrying now.... Just a little frustrating.
4	I love the easy to use case. You can pick a deck and slide it in and out without any problems. The only reason I did not give it 5 starts is that one of the magnetic clasps came loose the 3rd time I used. Simple fix but...
4	It’s a nice watch, attractive and well made but way to many features and too complicated for this simple guy.
4	Very nice jersey, love the material but the elastic on the arms are a bit too tight.
4	It seems that when you are rigging things, you always need something else. This was it.....Great!
4	These are very cute, just know that the toe is very pointy.
4	The only downside is the material is very stinky, chemical toxic stinky. So strongly suggest you put it away in a good ventalation area before you start using it.
4	They came late but they cute. This my third pair!
4	Case broke the moment I opened it
4	Item is the perfect size for both my 3 year old and for my 10 month old. However, for my 10 month old, they were a bit too tight for my comfort level, to keep them on her head, as my 3 year old said they were tight on him...prior to me adjusting to make them bigger. The pressure still made me nervous for my baby girl. Noise level, my 3yo said he couldn’t hear me and I was talking pretty loud. The only reason I returned them is because I ordered them in the green, expecting a mint color and they came in a grassy green color.
4	Great game for me and you.
4	There are separate color sheet, you can color or paint on them.
4	helpful streching my back & in other forms...
4	They are ok, not the best.
4	First order of this item when received was opened and had spilled. Call and received a replacement in no time at all.
4	nice quality for the price
4	Really liked how easy this case is to put together. With the glass screen protector its 360 coverage. The downside is this glass protector. Its not full adhesion. Its only double sided tape around the edges. I really got it centered and it seems to be holding fine for now. Its a great deal for full coverage and the case alone is worth the price. Update: 11 17 18 The case is good untill you remove a few times then it WILL break at the tabs that hold it together! If your planning to nvr to remove this case then it should last awhile.
4	I got these for my fiancé. he is a chef and they have been holding up pretty well so far. But thy loose some star not arriving when promised.
4	Awesome and comfortable.
4	works well. Dont like the fact you have to unhook part of band for it to fit. But otherwise does it's job.
4	This fan is MUCH quieter than the contractor grade fan installed when our house was built. It was easy to install and its instructions were clear. It's not as silent as I had hoped but it is really good. My only regret is that I did not replace the contractor fan earlier.
4	Nice looking lock Not hard to install Some of the crews are hard to screw in on the sides
4	Purchased this for my daughter. She is pregnant with twin and it really has helped her sleep well through the night.
4	Love these!! Four stars just because of the price. They are a little expensive but so absorbant!
4	Worked great, all parts were in the box!!!! Be advised to assemble it where you plan on using it because it’s big and took 4 of us to move it after we assembled it.
4	Easy to install and work with. Just have to take time to find the right level to hinder the barking.
4	As long as you have a really good WiFi connection, it works well. High quality picture during the day and about 5 feet of high visibility at night. Major draw back is trying to save a clip. I needed several minutes of recorded video for court and every time I set the clip up with the time I needed, it automatically went back by two minutes and recorded one of those minutes instead. I tried repeatedly and could not get the video I needed to save. Somewhat defeats the purpose of having it.
4	The earings are much bigger than I had expected. I was hoping for something a little more dainty
4	Very cute towel with vibrant colors. My issue is its not really soft? Disney Store has better quality and cheaper during the summer months. My little girl Love's LOL, got it mainly to make her happy.
4	Nice fit to my Trek DS 4. Tight and snug. I do not use the top compartment. In Florida, my phone overheats in it. No problem with the rest of it. A solid 4 or maybe 5. Pending on how you look at it.
4	Not as soft or cuddly as I expected from Gund.
4	Doctored up; this could be great stuff (mix it with peanut butter, or put some juicy fresh pepper mince in it). On it's own; as a topping for a pork chop; I'd prefer Tabasco brand chipotle. -That could be improved with doctoring also though.
4	Good quality as far as I can tell. I used two of them to connect satellite speakers to my Vizio 5.1 soundbar. They fit VERY snug, and arrived in a bag within a box with a piece of Velcro included.
4	Got this to add to a costume for a fun run. Fit a little on the bulky side but served it's purpose.
4	Works great. Small but great for small gathering use. Easy to take out and use anytime. Kids love it!
4	One size doesn’t fit all. Other than that love the hat. Sturdy material is great for my 4 yr old.
4	Born to be Different is a cute book that teaches about the differences in people. The story is short with simple illustrations and a positive message.
4	It's good, I think. I don't know if adding more memory actually made much difference in the functioning of my computer. Service from the seller was excellent.
4	I bought this to connect my laptop to an extra monitor, works smoothly.
4	The pens work nicely enough, but unlike most pens, the pen caps won't stay on the back of the pen. As I suspect many people do, I tried to place the pen cap on the back of the pen so as not to lose it when writing, and it doesn't fit snugly and just kind of wobbles around there.
4	Not as full as I expected or as pictured
4	This is the third one I have purchased. It last about 2-3 years and gets a lot of use. It is the most comfortable float for sitting and floating around the pool with a drink. It will deteriorate faster if you leave it in the sun, we store under roof. Good quality. Not a kids toy as the mesh can be ripped, but this is mine and I take care of it.
4	Worked as specified!
4	a good read .... it does stand on its own when compared to Agatha Christie but the story had too many points of comparison to Christie's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE
4	ALL IS GOOD, EASY TO INSTALL, MY ONLY ISSUE IS WHEN I TRY A CUSTOMIZE PICTURES IS NOT UPLOADING? PLEASE HELP ME HERE, DO I HAVE TO CHANGE ANYTHING BEFORE I UPLOAD? HANKS...RAMON
4	Works well and is compatible with the Alexa app. No problems controlling through both my 2nd and 3rd generation Echo Dots.
4	Packaging was perfect, it arrived on time & in perfect condition. Wonderful experience with a company who was also the absolute lowest price.
4	I think it's the fact that I have hair that the hat doesn't fit well. I know it says women's but my brother actually took over my hat and it looks better on him than me. Any who, good material.
4	I have carefully read this guide and extracted a lot of knowledge from it. Which has been instrumental in shaping my career. Moreover, I was able to learn the programming language and manage applications very easily. Thanks.
4	Good solution for replacement part no longer made.
4	Movies don't always have to mean something, sometimes you need a good laugh! RIP John Candy :-(
4	This is a good product for the price. It is very sturdy and well made for a budget tee. The two things I would like to see in the future would be the ability for other toppers such as a brush. Also, being that this is most likely used as a travel tee it should have a bag. Other than that it is a great product.
4	The hat I received is not the same as the picture. But dad liked it.
4	Was what I needed for a theme party
4	Happy with the design & quality. The glue was not consistent on the product. Pack had 4 and 1 of them was not good enough to stick. Luckily I only needed 2 so I yet have a spare.
4	Works great with chicco fit 2 infant seat
4	This is a good dog food container. I use it for refrigerated dog food. A handle on top of the container would make it a lot easier to move the container in and out of the fridge.
4	Very comfortable. Wide headband. Wide range of adjustability. The only problem I had with them is my glasses are quite large and get stuck inside. I must take off both the goggles and my glasses and then pry my glasses out of the goggles. I have this issue with most of the goggles I have used so it's just something I have gotten used to. Fast delivery and well packaged. I will order again.
4	It's really comfortable, but the size I got according to chart (34D) is not good for running. It fits nicely if I were to just wear it around the house, but for high impact exercise I'll probably go down a size.
4	Love Acer's...this is my 6th one... I up grade and give older tablets to others..this is middle of the road not hi end but good for Bible study.... bought two and one the touch screen is not very sensitive...really have to pay attention.
4	Does it's job but collapses when you use it. Can't press up against your head when using to get a good curl but it works.
4	So easy to use! I wish it didn’t take 4 minutes for each pancake/waffle but not a huge deal. My only suggestion is to make sure you spray the plates with Pam in between each pancake/waffle or they will stick.
4	Pleasure to order from Amazon. Cannot find the refills in stores anymore.
4	Long lasting and sturdy!
4	I definitely have more energy while using this product
4	the title certainly does not over promise -- no lack of clear examples where the author distills the subject matter into 1 liter of hard to swallow Russian vodka in a plastic bottle.
4	A bit hard to put together, but otherwise really nice.
4	It’s such a cute and durable cover. My only complaint is that it only slides through 1 watch band. Making the side with ears easy to knock over. It was a pain to wear at Disney. I had to constantly be flipping it back. But it was good material and very cute. If not for that only flaw.
4	Great item. My 9 year old loves it. Easy to use and reliable!!!!
4	My 5 year old daughter got this for her birthday and loved it. The item is well made and worth the money.
4	It appears to be a reasonable product
4	Rated 10,000 hours. 20 Mbps read and write. I tested this out and only got around 15 Mbps read and write. For the money and specs, the Samsung is a better value. Yes, you don't need fast speeds but when you are copying files for backup or uploading to YouTube, the read speed helps a lot.
4	Looks good, with a bit of loosed grasses
4	Bright as shit. Easy to install but it’s vey flimsy
4	Although the original picture displayed a white headband with palm, the headband I received is pink. That is the only reason I am knocking this product a star. The product came is very nice quality packaging and was soft to the touch upon opening. The product is easy to use and to clean when necessary. Great product.
4	I was generally pleased with this two pack of tees, made of an easy to wash microfiber fabric. The fit is true to size. The only negative is that these tees are really LONG. Don't get me wrong, I like a tee that covers my tummy and back end, but this is almost a min dress! I am 5'6" and this tee is really almost too long on me. On a shorter person it would be impossible.
4	The screen keeps having technical difficulties by cutting to black at frequent times for a few seconds and I’m not sure why
4	Great for recessed or track lighting Dimmable LED White to Color. Doesn't produce Green and Cyan well but other colors are good. These also come in PAR models also (with pins on bulbs) For table lamps I recommend the A19 Hue models for a natural look.
4	This is a great little dress that doubles as a coverup for me. It tends to have a lot of static if accidentally put in the dryer but overall it's a nice easy summery dress.
4	Check pharmacy prices and you will realize what a great buy these are.
4	Nice easy to put together took time but not difficult
4	The teeth looked good, but wouldnt stick. I even tried denture cream.
4	The high-pitched noise as well as the vibration helps to distract my dog. Unfortunately, the collar does not work consistently. It is also too big for my dogs neck, so it is difficult to make it work all the time. We do like it better than other bark collars then we have had in the past.
4	This is a great way to clean up the laundry room, I installed it and as its not secured on top it did flex out a bit at the top, but I just anchored it. Also the shoe horn to fish the dryer pipe through is not really effective, it just seemed to elongate the dryer pipe as it put pressure the pipe would flex and not fit the hole. I just used my fingers. But the finish is great and the product is sturdy and durable. Removing the existing 90 on my dryer vent really improved drying, and allowed me to clean the dryer vent pretty easy.
4	Like Harry Potter and Cole Phelps made a book together, love the series
4	It was a good read but I won't recommend it as a reference book for SQL. Content could have been better.
4	Very cute!!! Not completely as I thought it was going to be though, but for the price completely adorable!! Pretty good quality and it's like a rib tank part for the top but still super cute. Will work great for her costume! <3 fits true to size
4	Would have liked it to be just a little bit taller...she doesn't play with it much because it is so close to the ground, I think.
4	Very satisfied so far - Does the job perfectly well! Already tested under various weather conditions including Partly Cloudy... Have used on a highway under a bright Sun and everything was fine, drove into the tunnel - and everything was still great... Alleys with trees on the sides have always been a big issue for me.... Now they are not! Only one downside so far is that when you fold it after use, its legs are touching the lens - might create scratches as time passes - That's the ONLY reason why only 4 stars... This is something the developers of the product have to think in the future. Everything else is just great!
4	Wish there were more ventilation holes in this, but otherwise its a good product. Fits a standard size litter box, not a deluxe one. Wipes clean very easily. Sturdy. One cat was too fat for the hole, but that's not the products fault :)
4	Easy putting together. All the parts were there.
4	The controls are a bit confusing so read the directions but I'm sure it's made that way so that your kid won't mess with the function...but then second day I couldn't get it to the timer mode so I am a bit confused..otherwise I am continuing working on this with my toddler but he likes to take it off so I wish there was a way to make it more secure..otherwise the alarm is a little song...but my toddler does know it as the potty watch!
4	Nice case overall. Responsive buttons. Good feel in the hand. The silver color just looks "off" to me, not quite what site color looked like.
4	0.25 oz is small, but I knew that because I read the description, so no complaints about that from me. I got all three different types as described, and I like all of them ,but creme brulee is my favorite and smells wonderful. Great size to carry in purse.
4	Works well on my stove when I broke the knob is a little jit smaller then I thought. But it does the same thing the original did so it works out
4	This made my skin noticeably smoother and brighter. I loved using this stuff! I applied it once in the morning before makeup and once at night. I cannot use it now due to prescription face cream. The ingredients do not mix well with my new night cream. The only negative I have is the smell. The smell is horrible and is made worse when paired with sweat or makeup. So don't be alarmed if you start to notice a weird smell. I would describe it as medical gloves. Weird, I know.
4	Well built item that seems very durable. Holds cards as it should. I haven't tested its waterproof~ness but I'm sure it's at least water resistant.
4	Works well but the flavor didn’t get my dogs as excited for teeth brushing as other flavors have.
4	I like the leash, but the foam handle ripped off after about 15 uses. I bought the leash 2 months ago, how do I contact the seller for a replacement?
4	Good product at a good price.
4	Got the job done, and was fairly easy to use. I would like more information on all the options.
4	It started out slow, but enjoyed the hunt,the game of love. Society rules,and women exploring their freedom secretly. Best of all the adventures, action that finally exploded at the end, great ending.
4	It seems to be a good deal. I haven't had top use it and hopefully won't, it's a warranty.
4	This is for a gift so I’m not sure how it is going to fit. It looks pretty true to size. However, the red isn’t red. It’s more of a pink color. The fabric feels a little cheap.
4	Attractive, nice glaze, handle has a most convenient little bump on it that makes gripping very secure when it’s full.
4	The stiffer material makes it harder to store food in. My kids like the little animated fruits and veggies on them. I would try another product of different material next time.
4	Everyday Casual wear...
4	Very nice, color vibrant, easy to stuff with large old down blanket and towels
4	Length of shirt was not what I expected other than that everything fit great.
4	They dont last long but they are cheap and work very well. Dont submerge in water bc it may stop working.
4	my sister has bees. I gave it to her as a gift
4	Great gloves all around except lost star because the grip on the fingertips wore down fairly quickly
4	this pillow works out for what its worth
4	The Peppermint & Lavender are my favorite. Separately or blended together are great! The Joy blend is ok...very light for the diffuser. The Rose scent is interesting, still figuring out how to use it...overall a good set to have on hand...I do love this brand of oils, most have worked great!
4	nothing to say they are new and worked for my grill
4	This watch has a larger face than I expected, but otherwise, as described - great look, good feel, and accurate time keeping
4	After broken in fit perfect
4	Solidly made. Tough.
4	Nice, but too many. My friends loved them and they really topped off my luau. V festive. Boyfriend says: "These shed EVERYWHERE! And you wouldn't let me throw them away!"
4	These work, definitely cut down on how many horse flies are terrorizing us at the pool. Keep in ind their instructions, have it somewhat away from the main area, as they STINK. They're supposed to (supposed ot smell like decomposing animal - lovely I know but we're talking flies here). Downwind if possible. BUT... regardless, it does work (there are still a couple of horse flies here and there but not to the extent there had been)
4	Great ornaments for someone who likes woodland creatures or owls. Bought for sis in law and she really liked them. Giving it four stars only because they are a bit cheap looking. They are plastic and shatterproof. Product was as described and arrived on time.
4	I finally got rid of the mice in my warehouse with this ultrasonic item. Great
4	Got these to Make bath fizzies and they worked great! The only downside is that the little tab that’s used to open it back up after you have closed it breaks easily. 3 of them snapped right off.
4	Doesn't cover the other outlet and looks good. I wish the plastic lip on top covered the cord but it hides it well enough.
4	This item quality is really good for the low cost. I purchased it, wrongly thinking it included a screen protector. I went ahead and installed a screen protector separately and kept this case because I still considered it good value for the money. The kickstand seems decent. It seems like a sturdy case that will greatly protect.
4	Plastic pcv but it serves its purpose. Good to have ..
4	great cup, ALMOST the same as the OEM cups that came with, EXCEPT no fill lines :(
4	What I liked most about these eyelashes is that they looked good on me I didn’t have a problem with them
4	First time purchasing hardside luggage. Plan to purchase additional suitcases for the family. Very easy to overfill; therefore must be careful in not overloading when packing.
4	I love the feel of the fabric. This is more comfortable than the CK underwear I had a couple years ago. The pouch is a little confusing so a usage diagram would be nice, but comfort is key for me with underwear and these are amazingly comfortable. I wish there was a photo of the cut on the ordering page as the legs were a little longer than I’m used to but they aren’t too long for me. Overall I love them. Included photos are inside of the undies, the fly, and the front laid flat
4	This medieval novel was action packed with a of twists. Stealing a bride to avenge the death of his wife I would definitely recommend
4	I have 3 pair of these socks. I wear them when exercising 3 times a week at the gym + any long distance walking. I have ankle injuries that I've done PT for, which has increased my range of motion and strength, but not reduced swelling from trauma. These help immensely as I need the compression. They stay up mostly and moisture wick nicely. Often I can wear them more than once before I need to wash them.
4	Band fits and looks nice! Worth the money.
4	Hair is really soft and pretty, but I'm not a fan of the closure. Like others have stated, there are a lot of tiny short hairs in the closure that stick up. The closure hair also doesn't lay flat, flat ironing doesn't help.
4	I just looked at this suggestion to review my kindle cover and realize I didn't get the color I ordered. Instead of punch red i received a greyish-black. I was surprised i had ordered such a drab color. As to the cover itself it is durable, fits well, and lightweight.
4	Looks nice, sounds okay. Just a little something to add to the Easter basket.
4	At first the taste was a little off-putting but that was offset by the benefit of ingesting a combo mix of salt and sugar substitute. I wouldn't recommending overdoing it, but once every 45 minutes depending on your need might be good. It kept me from bonking but I supplemented it with a lite electrolyte drink and water as well as some stingers.
4	So far so good, plastic could be stronger, we’ll see how it holds up.
4	I'm not sure they are the best wipers.
4	I like the jacket, but got a bright red color when I ordered maroon/burgundy. (If i got the right color would have been 5 star review)
4	Well, I really LOVED everything I got in the kit. Managed to get half a gallon of Kombucha from the Scoby #1 that came with the kit - (after 20 days). Set everything up for 2nd brew and had mold after 3 days. (Big Sigh). Threw Scoby #1 & #2 out, along with tea, per instructions from friends that brew all the time. Although I’m pretty sure that was an operator error on my part because I’m a beginner, I’m pretty bummed that everyone keeps talking about how easy it is to do - but apparently not for a Moron like me. Can’t decide if I should order another one or just drink off of my friends for life. Haha!
4	Still like Lynn Raye Harris versions of Hot better! This book was Good, but not quite as exciting for me!
4	Fits perfectly, but broke in less than a year. I guess it's an ok product for the price.
4	There's a thick dry film in the top of the paste inside the jar almost as if the container doesn't properly seal it. You have to break apart or peel the film to get to the usable paste. Otherwise, pretty good stuff
4	Easy to use Connection is easy and long range Noise cancellation is not that good
4	Easy to put up and works as advertised
4	Received my CenterPoint Sniper 370 yesterday. The sling was missing from the box, but I probably would never have used it anyway. It took about 10 shots to get it sighted in on bullseye at 10 yards. After that BINGO! It put three bolts within ½ of each other, dead on bullseye. Many reviewers complained of creepy trigger pull, but mine is crisp and release is smooth. VERY pleases with the 370 so far. About three weeks until bow season opens in Louisiana, so I have time to practice at longer ranges. The only reason I don't rate it at five stars is because the sling was missing from the box.
4	I have a 2010 Rav4 which is a smaller SUV and I had to push the headrests all the way down to get them to fit (barely!) and really stretched them to their limit... I am not sure how long they will last. Also, There should be two more straps with plastic holder that holds the area where the bottom and back of the seat meets
4	This is a very good quality corded headset that could be used for any laptop, desktop, TV or any other audio devices. Yes, it has mute feature and voice control. It offers a great sound quality at its price point. It gives you the private entertainment of ear-pleasing sound without disturbing others or you from surrounding noise. Its noise-canceling feature is very good. Earmuffs are soft and comfortable for extended use. It doesn’t require a battery, just plug and play. It also comes with a beautiful hard case to store and carry around with your laptop. It is foldable, lightweight & compact and it as a decent sound quality which could be adjusted with noise control on the computer. I find that the switch and volume control could be better. I find them a good value.
4	The taste is not ideal. It is not disgusting but it is not very good. I do see an improvement in my supply when I drink this.
4	First time I am using this. I ordered this to use with thigh high support stockings to make sure they stayed up, so far its good. I really had never seen this product or was aware it was available. THANKS
4	I was reading some reviews on whether or not this works with Blue Yeti mic, and even the description says it doesn't, but I got it anyway because my friends who own this say it's fine. I wasn't expecting much when I made my purchase, but turns out it's actually not that bad; the arm is lightweight but it gets sturdy after you mount it. I did have to tighten the screw at the top with a small wrench to hold the Yeti in position (right now I have it up diagonally). I haven't noticed any drooping but it's only been couple days and I've been moving it around, but overall I'm satisfied with this arm for the Yeti mic!
4	Good Sound. I like that it has AM FM radio. It's a good size for taking along with you. I bought it for a Christmas present, I think they're going to love it.
4	Great tv in the upper mid range io quality
4	I use these to clean my eye-glasses, and these work well, very clean with no marks, and the package is convenient for everyday use or travel. But there is a very strong alcohol smell when you open up the individual pack. Since almost all our glasses are made by some kind of poly-carbonate material, and so I am not so sure if that is safe for a long term usage for cleaning poly-carbonate lenses with the coatings....
4	The quality is not bad for the price. The top is fairly well constructed. The base is adequate. Not as easy to get the “on side” rotation as I was hoping for but it does work well with some practice
4	My granddaughter loved this and it is very cute. The only problem is that it sheds all over! We put him in the dryer but he still continues to shed. Despite the shedding, she loves him.
4	It’s a little too big for my loveseat but I do like the how soft the fabric is.
4	The tumblers were great. They were a perfect size. The only problem I had was I ordered silver trim and received gold.
4	The taste is really delicious. It takes care of my mouth plus it gives me pleasure every time I am taking this.
4	I would of rated this product 5 star but because the vent visor logo fell off the bug guard when driving the vehicle I'm not going to, the logo should of been secured better to the guard !
4	My son loves it, my only concern is the woman swimming doesn't seem to have a suit on if you look closely....
4	Love, love this product but the spray bottle was empty as it all spilled out during shipping. Was super sad as the spray is what I use the most.
4	I'm thrilled with this watch. It's beautiful, and fits my wrist perfectly. It isn't a Submariner, but it's got to be the best value in automatic dive watches available. Mine is getting +4 and -3 out of the box.
4	Not the top of the line quality, but it functions for what I needed. If you are looking for something simple, reliable, and functions, this is the way to go. The lid isn't as heavy as I would like, and always needs a bit more effort to close it back down (after taking a straw out). Otherwise, it works and I will keep using it as long as it lasts.
4	It does the job but it seems a little to long and when the hammer strikes the end of this fixture it puts pressure on the front of the lower receiver and if done to much will mare the finish. Maybe mine was cut wrong ?
4	I wish there were more to the roll, but works great for protecting poster, needed to figure out how to apply with out too many air pockets
4	This thing is pretty thick. The only way my boyfriend wanted to wear it was if he cut out the extra flap. Oops, next time I won't get Extra Capacity. Leather quality felt nice.
4	I really like the way it looks. I kinda wish the flowers went all the way around. I wore it as a necklace too.
4	Very trendy right now. Definitely worth the price. I love how the shoe has a little cushion to it & not super stiff like other shoes in this style. Color is great. They're a little wide & I have narrow feet. I'm not sure if sizing down is the answer but they're still very wearable. I'll probably order another color.
4	Its pretty good but wish it was a little bit more wider
4	I had no problems viewing this (my subtitles were shut off by default for some reason, and I had to fix that in the settings, which was easy). As someone who used to love but now can't sit through anything with gratuitous gore/violence, I found this to have just enough suspense and darkness to it. It's a tragic ghost story that was beautifully shot and well acted throughout.
4	Very good product but could hace gotten it elsewhere for a lower price
4	Likes: pretty dress and the ruffles really give it that look. The small amount of gathering in the mid section Iffy: the material is a little see through and definitely will have to wear black undergarments
4	Works great looks great. Does make some noise but it was a great addition to my man's man cave.
4	These overalls are super cute and comfy! However I was expecting for them to be a bit bigger and kinda hang off me instead of fitting perfectly.
4	Really like this case for my iphone 11 pro. It holds my phone and all the essentials.
4	The Instant Pot since this book makes it seem very easy to use and gives great recipes. For anyone just looking to get started, this is a great resource to have on hand.
4	Hard type but very pretty my daughter loved it.
4	Cute. It was cheap and came as expected.
4	The length of the cable is good. Connectors between joints work ok. However, if the water pressure is high, it can disconnect the connectors. You can use ziptie to tighten these joints.
4	bought as a gift. nice packaging.
4	Just a touch wider than I had hoped. I am 5.5 and weigh about 140. The medium is a bit to wide at the bottom but a good longer length. It fits nice through the busy and shoulders.
4	Fantastic jacket. Lightweight enough to wear in summer and surprisingly warm on chilly days. Better for a slimmer body - ive got a little bit of a belly and that keeps it from buttoning completely (the button clasps aren't super strong).
4	Tree is beautiful and lights are the perfect brightness. Sadly, the first windy day the tree broke off of the base. Specifically, the metal tore above all of the 4 spot welds holding the lower tree's part's metal tube to the base. I solved the problem by creating a new base using 18" long 1/2" black iron pipe to push inside the tree's metal tube, then attached that to a 1/2" black iron pipe flange. This flange was then welded to 4 legs of 2" angle iron, each 15" long. The base is then held down with 2 sandbags.
4	My son loved this, hence the 4 stars. Product is made cheap, but for the price, you get what you pay for
4	Does all that is promised but doesn’t fit well in all car seats.
4	This is a sturdy ball, however, the 55" is not good office seating. I am 5'2" and at my desk while sitting on the ball, my chin is just above my standard desk. Going back.
4	Lightweight comfortable charging easily stay charged
4	Grip is fairly good but the covers do not seem to be tightly glued to the bladder. It isn't really priced on the high end, so who cares about the minor covers issue. I can always buy a crazy glue and do what I need to do (if/when needed). A decent basketball overall.
4	These waterproof underwear are still very good, that is, the pants are a bit high.
4	product works great and got it quickly in the mail.
4	I lived in Japan for many years and it translates well if you have had that experience.
4	What a great colorful case that is heavy duty quality for a low price. The only downside to this case is that it is open in the front (no cover)
4	It was a little wordy and mentions that mommy bought me a potty. This mommy is not dumping and cleaning a plastic commode!
4	These are NOT ouchless if you have a heavy head of hair. They are better used for children versus adults.
4	I installed them using a youtube video I found online. They work great, just would recommend instructions or a even a link referencing a "how-to" when sending to customers.
4	The only reason i did not give 5 stars is that before i gave as gift did need to apply several coats of mineral oil to give it the lush look. i would buy again for myself!
4	While doing early Christmas Shopping for my kids and my niece I came across this adorable musical set. Since my kids are 8 and 10 I was trying to find something that my niece could use for a few years so it wasn't wasteful but also they don't have a lot of space in their apartment so I was trying to keep that in mind. I really love how everything fits into the backpack so it saves space but also so she can take it on the go. With 17 instruments I don't have to worry she will be bored after a few minutes. The pictures showed the tambourine had a giraffe, a monkey and a lion on it which I really liked but the one I received was actually a picture of a bee or maybe a butterfly so I was slightly disappointed by that. Overall it's a cute set but I do feel it is slightly on the expensive side for the quality and what you actually get.
4	It looks good and arrived as expected. Cannot tell if I feel or look any better yet because I just started using it. The jade looks and feels great. My only comment is the writing on the jade is a bit big but other than that it's all good.
4	I've been very happy with these in the past but the last couple didn't fit as nicely.
4	The product is exactly what I needed to cover my front and back of the phone, been using it for a week now and no scratches on the cover as well. Service was excellent!!
4	Super sturdy, could probably defend yourself from a wild dog with this case. Would buy again for more chips if the stakes get high enough.
4	Didn’t fit as expected. I tried it on my daughter and I was really flexible. However, it was too loose for her and it kept rolling up and coming off. If you have a larger head, this may be for you.
4	Feels nice on your skin.
4	my wife love it just the assembly sucks . overall is good.
4	I bought this for my wife who travels a lot for work and over the years I have noticed her frustrations more and more with an old cosmetic bad she would used. Here’s her actual review of the product: This makeup bag has been a game changer! I travel a lot for work and this is so easy to grab and go. I do wish the band lengths were a little smaller but overall I’m able to easily organize all my makeup, roll it down to see everything, and roll it up to secure and put in my luggage. I’ve used it every trip since I got it. Love it!
4	Great product - stuck on right away and the gel padding feels very comfortable. Would purchase again.
4	These socks can be a bit too tight and leave mark if to wear all day, otherwise, nice socks.
4	Nice little mirror but the tint was too dark for me makes it hard to see,returned for refund .
4	Definitely small, but it fits the essentials and that is what I wanted.
4	The instructions in the package was out of date and incorrect (i.e. mentioned that side A had four holes total on one end when it was only three which confused me as to whether or not I had the wrong side... and Step 2 was a copy and paste image of Step 3 so it was unclear what goes where). Other than that, great product, super sturdy and would definitely recommend!
4	Love having these little cheat sheets with me during clinical. I told all my classmates about this and now I see everyone walking around with them.
4	So comfy, bought it for myself Andy kids ke stealing it
4	I bought it to mod. Good specs for a cheap watch. No complaints.
4	A little awkward for what I am using them for...I DJ and use them to cue music...they are little uncomfortable because the cups turn and can be awkward when I am trying to cue quickly but overall good sound
4	Mirrors are so clear, and the design is pretty well thought-out. However, there were no pre-drilled holes as described in the instruction sheet, making it rather more difficult than necessary to attach the hangars. I have to assume it was a one-off problem, and ultimately I'm pretty happy with how the mirrors look! There seem to be magnets of something holding the mirror shut when closed. I feel like there should be some visual cue as to which side the mirror opens from, and closes from. When you're opening the mirror, it's a guessing game (is it the magnet holding it shut and I should pull harder, or am I pulling on the wrong side?), and when you're closing the wings, if you guess wrong you put strain on the hinges because they hit the frame.
4	These phone rings were really cheap for the quality of the product, and are a super cute addition to your phone, but my only problem is that the adhesive isn't very strong. It sticks to my phone and stays, but is very easy to peel off, and just feels like it'll fall off at any second.
4	This is a gorgeous band, but a little difficult to put on due to the magnet closure constantly sticking as you try to adjust the band. The photo is with my rose gold 3rd gen Apple Watch for color comparison. The band is very adjustable and my go to design due to having a very small wrist that’s often too small for other Apple Watch bands to fit.
4	I am disappointed in my clay for it looks and smells as if covered in mold. Emailed the company and the responded quickly with new clay on the way.
4	The light output is good. The 9006 lights are loose on their base and the 9005 bulbs had to be ground down to fit my headlight housings because they are too big. However, for the price I am happy and they seem to work well.
4	I have used it twice a day since I received it. I think it is helping.
4	i used these for listening to podcasts and music at my job. battery would last for multiple days and sound quality was pretty good for the price. however, after owning them for 6 months one ear bud stopped working. i still had use of all the features after the war bud stopped working though. overall, i’m not upset about it for what i paid for them and i wasn’t exactly gentle with them either.
4	Have not watched it yet.
4	Good for everyday web browsing or social media. Not so much for Games or Movies. For the price not bad considering. Thank you Philip G Scott
4	I like the feeling of this case, it doesnt protect the edges of the phone very well.
4	Tom is always a good read but his books just go on and one and on......... Plausible story line especially in light of today's news.
4	Its says espresso but it actually has more of a burgundy to it then a dark brown??. but still nice!
4	I love this tripod. I havent used it yet, but it looks like its a quality product. So the tripod comes with many attachments. I purchased it to record self videos and with it i can use my phone, tablet, and camera to do that. I also got it to watch netflix or other streams by just propping it near the bed. I opened it up, checked all features including bluetooth, which connects quickly, seems worth the money. Its not as tall if u dont use the portion that bends, but besides that, its nice. I would buy it again.
4	Works well for the table but just wasnt impressed with the duller color.
4	Seems to be of the normal quality of other exercise balls that I've had and around the same price point.
4	they worked and look really great on my chairs, gave it 4 out of 5 since one of the 4 i ordered wa stained but im returning it and ordering another one. extremely easy to install and changes teh whole look of my little dining room set
4	The phone is great, as advertised. The only thing I didn't like is that you need an adapter to connect the headphones, which I'm sure eventually will get loss. Other than that, the phone is amazing.
4	The coloring is not as teal. It’s s very soft aqua/mint. Cute outfit. Well made. Soft
4	With some fabrication I was able to mount this to my 1985 cj7 looks great and seems to be strong not as thick of a material as I would like but still seems strong
4	This was a cute story and I enjoyed it very much.
4	Really effective for keeping out the heat! We noticed an immediate difference after hanging it outside over our sliding door.
4	Great bumper for my toddlers twin bed. Easy to place in the bed and remove when sheets needs to be removed and washed. My toddler kicks and moves allot but this bumper keeps my toddler in the bed all night.
4	Probably not up to the professional quality of Stewmac luthier tools, but meet my DIY needs just fine.
4	They were cute a bit smaller than I expected. My kiddo loves them.
4	College ceased being a bastion of free speech and free exchange of ideas decades ago. Thanks to liberals.
4	Zach is found with a head injury in a hiking path that Charlie was on. She nurses him back to health but he's missing the last few years of his life. She helps him cope with the memory lapse by taking him to a family cabin to rest and recover. It was never explained how he was injured and who did it. You wonder if it was his business partner and fiancee but are never told. She thinks that she loves her neighbor Kirk who is a doctor where she works. Zach falls quickly for Charlie but she needs to see Kirk's true character before she realizes that Zach has much more to offer her. It's cute, light, no bad guys making trouble for main characters. A quick read.
4	Was expecting a much lesser quality item for the price but when it arrived in the mail I was impressed. It was also packaged very nicely so I did not find any scratches. The color is a nice white and it is true to size. Fits well in small places and is complimentary to other furniture. My only disappointment was that there was a decent sized ding on the bottom shelf that someone had put white out/cover on top of to hide. It's very small but I still noticed.
4	This product didn't end up being right for me and when I returned it they gave me a FULL refund. The customer service was great! They helped me out a lot.
4	These are thick and sturdy. They stay in place. I would like to have one more smaller band for even more resistance. These are good. I like them. They seem like they will last a long time.
4	Great value for family and pets!
4	Works great so far. Great color and texture. The only minor (minor) issue is this: the velcro strap that allows you to wrap the wire up and secure it doesn’t fit over the plugs, so instead of conveniently adhering to the wire at all times, even when not being utilized, it is unattached.
4	I haven't had the unit long enough for a real review but so far the screen protector and the Spigen case are working well. The big question with screen protectors is do they stay securely to the glass and so far mine is. If it lasts over time I would give it a 5 star rating.
4	Good but it takes practice
4	Looks great and fit right.
4	I can't seem to get it to put out full power but it works a hell of a lot better than the 80 amp stock alternator for my new stereo system.
4	The only thing I would change is the size of the mesh filter which has a very small capacity. I have to fill it about three times and then it loses enough heat I have to nuke it because I add half and half. But, I really like this unit a lot.
4	Very beautiful. The flocking is just lovely. The only problem is the screws in the tree stand do not seem to fit so our tree is a little wobbly if moved.
4	Purchased as a Christmas gift for an avid 9 y/o reader, this book wasn't enthusiastically received. I suspect the prose poetry was off-putting. And yet, she may come around to it in time. I'm hoping.
4	I would prefer an electronic light sensor adjustment, so I could custom set the light level it operates on, since it activates when its still light. Can't fault it otherwise, and certainly good value for money.
4	This book was worth the read. It Seemed to drag a bit as it took forever for Breckenridge and Heather to get to their real feelings of love....
4	It's been so long since I read this that I can't remember details about the normal things I mention in reviews. I only remember that I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It was fun to see a non-magical person thrive in a magical world, and everything flowed together. Diverse characters were the cherry on top.
4	Love the flowers on the sandals. Wish they were better foot support. One of them were messed up when I got it but I fixed it because that's what wouldve been easiest in the long run.
4	works good but need to inform people that it is a slide on blade replacement
4	Great invention!! Super easy to use and they do hook up to target bags with no issue. My only problem with them is that they seem to unscrew while pumping. I had to keep retightening them
4	This ordered because it was a required book for a college course that my daughter is taking. I never knew that Amazon sold used books. What a great idea. Prime pays for itself again.
4	Very sturdy once assembled, but assembly requires a bit of muscle to get everything to line up properly.
4	Item works very well. I have not had to use the shock button on either dog yet but light, beep and vibrate all work.
4	It is flux, and it works. Could warrant 5 stars, but I am so green at soldering that I don't have a large bank of experience to compare it with other products.
4	So far these are nice although I thought the blue would be more navy and it is much lighter. Colors should be corrected on line.
4	Fly mask arrived in a timely manner. The "horse" size fits my large quartet horse well. My only complaint is that the ears are a couple of inches too long so they tend to flop and irritate him. Seems to be well-made. I would recommend this purchase.
4	It wasn’t really hard to assemble
4	Great quality for the price. They arrived pretty quickly and in great condition. They were wrapped very securely and kept separated from each other. They look very nice under light.
4	Absolutely didn't work for me. But what an amazing company, they saw my review and actually refunded me. No questions asked. No return necessary.
4	I didn't post a photo because I can't decide the best place to put these just yet, but I did test one on my wall and they are good quality, and removed without damaging my wall surface. The price was a few dollars lower than any craft store's. The cactus theme goes perfectly with my decor.
4	Couldn't find a reasonable soft toy Armadillo in retail shops as a baby gift for a Texan baby so had to buy one online. Amazing to live in Texas and have to go out of state to get an Armadillo.
4	This is a great addition to my Egyptian themed living room but wish there was some carvings on the handle
4	This fan is just okay. It does it’s job as a fan and it’s a good price, but I feel that it is cheaply made. Mine arrived today and one or the side caps was already broken off. I purchased brand new, however, I may have gotten a slightly used one that broke upon assembly and was sent back without inspection. It doesn’t affect the motor or the blade, but it’s kind of an eye sore. Guess it’s time to pull out the super glue and suck it up.
4	Overall, I'm very pleased. Excellent value for the cost. Easy setup, Exceptional video quality, I'm a bit disappointed with the audio clarity.
4	my only concerned about this problem is that the hinges are on the top instead of on the side like a book it would be a whole lot easier for me to have it open from the side and I feel like the product would be more stable in terms of latching. Outside of that it's able to hold report sheets and has a nice place to hold a pen on the bottom which I store an emergency pen because in healthcare pens disappear just as fast as pain medication :)
4	Wish it was filled more fully; the corners were not filled at all. I would have gotten a bigger insert if I'd known. But I can fill them in myself. They did come VERY qickly though and were not expensive.
4	Beautiful little shoes, but the flower decorations fell off after wearing them once.
4	The author does a real good job with the characters and how she describes them so perfectly. You can imagine being there with them as they are doing great one minute and sad the nest minute. Sorry that she had a miscarriage as bad as she wanted a baby but always hope for great things to happen in the future. A great read.
4	Just what my swollen legs needed! Really helps relieve the swelling and ache in my legs.
4	received as expected
4	A good, solid sport watch. Easy to read display, uncomplicated, sturdy construction. The band is comfortable if a bit flimsy feeling but at this price it's hard to complain. I like it.
4	Feels good but got kind of sticky after two or three uses. (Washes after every use an no lube was ised$ Also was slightly damaged when removing from a cloth harness. :(
4	I ordered this chair because of my lower back pain that is aggravated by sitting. The chair is easy to assemble, adjustable, and comfortable. I'm still getting used to it, but I think it will work well for me.
4	I ordered this when my daughter turned 6 months and it game with multiple dvds and flash cards for each set of dvds and books for the stories on the dvd. I will say at first I didn’t think it was all that but my daughter started trying to say the letters about 2 weeks into showing her the videos, I did slack some days. I can only imagine where she would be if I did it everyday . It’s proving useful so far
4	Very cute and clean looking. It was easy to assemble but not as thick / sturdy as I would have hoped
4	Lovely patterns. All are written patterns, no chart reading
4	All the Wolf Mountain Peak books are good and this is no exception. It was very nice for Helena to finally get her own book and chance at happiness. I voluntarily reviewed an arc.
4	Like that they are breathable.
4	Not only functions as described but even better. Works better then similar more expensive products This is a quality, well made product that should be an addition to every older mans' collection . Keeps things happening. In addition to the better and stronger erection it increases sensitivity and overall enjoyment. Although the instructions suggest using for 10 minutes at a time, you need to work up to 10 minutes . Use lube as recommended.
4	at least the objects were not super easy too find. addictive time waster but fun. some objects real small strained my old eyes.
4	Works great. Filters low and high frequency as described.
4	wow. Didn't expect this. Well done. Wish it had been more developed.
4	A little larger than what I had expected but the elastic on the arm helps with that! Overall I think it’s an awesome product!
4	works well, but I wish I could use them more than a couple times. They loose their flavor after a couple uses
4	Even with the zipper back my heel slipped out. Was able to slip them off without unzipping. Other than being too big, great shoe. Im sure would be comfortable un the right size.
4	Worked well but the XL was a little small for our large 100 lb. Lab.
4	Good quality, easy to use
4	Liked fit & finish but the adjustment stud was longer than original. Almost too long!! If I ever have to adjust i’ll Probably have to use vise grips. :-(
4	Sweet fit. Great i don't have to take off belt to move it around.
4	As advertised, good value.
4	Smaller then I thought
4	It was okay... didn't help my acne much
4	I have a 70 pound GSD and he is way too big for this crate. The top of the crate bulges up when he stands and he cannot raise his head. This would probably be great for a smaller dog. The construction and materials look fine.
4	Good bottle, trigger doesn’t feel as sturdy as the one from Sally’s but this does it.
4	Nice color. Best for tan to deep skin tones. Very pigmented.
4	They only sent 11 out of 12 brackets and the first package was lost. Being said they look beautiful fairly easy to put up just time consuming.
4	Gorgeous and stays on because you don’t have to continually pull it up. Will snag very easily.
4	I love my gel curing led light it has 3 different settings for curing time and it really works just like the salon!!!!!
4	I just tried this glue it works well. Gets tacky quickly.
4	Dust guards are very delicate & easy to tare or bend when installing. I think the price should be about $5 instead of almost $9.
4	The insert is just cardboard and I ended up just taking it out. Hard to fit longer wrapping paper rolls in it, but it helps keep everything organized.
4	I love Mam bottles. Baby took them with no problems. The nipple doesnt collapse causing you to take them out of the babies mouth. I gave 4 stars because they dont heat up well with bottle warmers due to the thickness and base of bottle.
4	My one complaint with this (as long as it lasts a reasonable amount of time) is that the instructions are rather terrible. Aside from that I had a battery go bad a few months after ordering this and it got me to and from work with plenty more power for more jumps. I'll add it jumped a Cadillac DTS with a large completely dead battery (used boost) with no problem. I really didn't think this paperback sized device was going to jump my Caddy and was pleasantly surprised. Although I haven't used it for charging devices like phones I like that it has that option. Well worth the money to have one of these in every vehicle imo, sure beats jumper cables which btw aren't all that much cheaper anyways and require (likely) the kindness of a stranger or someone else to work, and take up more trunk space. I would buy again and recommend to a friend.
4	Cover is cheap thin plastic
4	This is a very cool jewelry box. It's smaller than what I have expected, but still have a lot of room for different jewelry items. the good thing about this jewelry box is its organized interior with a lot of option to put your jewelry and the double level box makes it possible to organize the items even better. I'm happy with the purchase.
4	I do like the product. But it does have a somewhat annoying tick like other reviews say.
4	The design is adorable! I've had this on my Kindle Paperwhite for about 6 months and it works very well. Very easy to hold the Kindle with it on. The only complaint I would have is the corner edge pieces have broken off with normal wear and tear (keeping in my purse every day). I'm not exactly climbing Mount Everest...
4	What is the value for the price
4	Good product I wish the chain was longer though
4	one was missing a part so i return it. But i am ordering a new set.
4	love everything about this pillow except the color--the beige had a pinkish hue to to it--not what i was going for--but it is very soft & the fur has movement & sways--just wish it had been a true beige color.
4	These signs worked great for our baby announcement. Great product
4	Prompt delivery. Great condition. Correct size. I was hoping the top side would be just felted and softer. Otherwise a good pad for my oriental rug.
4	Was good and easy to install.
4	The Sage did not work as well but the Tea Tree works great on my eczema.
4	I used this stand for my brother's wedding cake (three tiers with the biggest being 10 inches) and it was really great. I was at a loss of what to use a few days before the wedding and this really fit the bill. It's sturdy and feels expensive. The only drawback is that the one I received isn't perfectly level; one of the legs is slightly shorter than the others. It's not a dealbreaker.
4	The game is addicting.
4	At first unable to get code to download app to my email or phone number. Have contacted the company via email. Now corrected. The notebook itself is more attractive than a similar product I got a year ago. I like that pages can be removed and returned to the notebook. The company responded promptly to my email.. App working with Google drive now. I'm pleased!
4	Works like a charm but especially in a small too the strong scent lingers for at least a week. It’s a fresh scent but also a constant reminder that your dog peed/vomited in that room not too long ago.
4	I like the fact you can cut things that are up high without a ladder however be ready this thing ways a ton. i used a clip to keep the throttle down so I could manipulate this beast. It is tough to hold the throttle down and cut for long periods of time. If your not a body builder or if you are are elderly and weak i would not recommend.
4	I used it along all four sides of medium and small rugs, along the outside edge, and across the middle. The rugs don’t move. Will they come up without floor damage (hard wood floor) ? I don’t know yet, and don’t plan to lift the rugs any time soon. My track star cat would flip and move the rugs every day, and I’m glad they now stay put.
4	Nice , soft and comfortable . Size I got was just too large
4	Worked great for 3.5 years. Then one of the heating bars, made of glass, fractured. Kind of a dramatic way to retire a toaster. Because it was one of the top bars, I almost didn’t even notice it. Pretty dangerous if you ask me. Before that, it worked great. Perfect for toasting and baking. Only downside was the dials need to be turned up all the way and then set to the desired time. Otherwise the timer might not turn off, which of course is a fire hazard. Now that I have to seek out a new one, I may or may not try this brand/model again. Still undecided.
4	Very thin fabric but super soft. Wrinkled upon arrival but better after hanging a while. Nice color.
4	We have a Dyson V10, which is a fantastic product. But this popped up as a lightning deal, so I bought it for a vacation cabin, thinking that if it stank, not much was ventured. Surprising performance. It only has one brush, so that has to do for both smooth surfaces and carpet. It performs almost as well as the Dyson on both, is lighter and easier to maneuver, and has a bit longer run time on a charge. It picks up pet hair quite well. It does tend to accumulate longer hair in the brush, compromising function, but this is fairly easy to remove. For the price, it's superb
4	I looked for a long time for a counter-top container for compost, and this is the closest I found. It's far more attractive than the plastic ice cream buckets I've been using. My primary complaint is the size. Unless you're really generating compost in your kitchen, there's no way you'd fill this before it needs emptying for smell alone. A smaller bucket would take up less counter space as well. I always put an unbleached coffee filter in the bottom as it makes emptying into the outside compost much easier (nothing sticks to the bottom), but this bin is too large a diameter to fully cover with one. A smaller one would solve both problems. Other than size, it seems well made. Will update my review after I've used it a year.
4	The top flap with the lock keeps the interior dry so people can drop of checks without me chasing them down to collect rents.
4	Bought these basically for work, I do a lot of outside work so I need something comfortable to wear. The fit is awesome! Overall good product!
4	The color in the picture was not the color we got
4	Did’nt hold the puppy pad as well as i would have liked
4	Honestly did not expect much because we all know how good the Iphone quality is as far as pictures go, but I thought adding this would just make it a little better like the length at which I can capture good pictures. I was really surprised to see that not only did it maintain the quality of the Iphone camera, but it also allowed me to zoom in quite a bit and capture some really nice pictures. If you are my friend you would know what a picture fanatic I am, and this product really brightened my day! Thank you guys.
4	Very cute, feels durable. Sterling silver. I wish the infinity sign was a bit bigger though sizing down so it can fit on a smaller finger!
4	I wear these shoes to work every day. They are very comfortable. I am 78 and have knee trouble, so I need something that fits well.
4	I’m sure this is a great product for some mothers, but maybe I just don’t produce enough milk. I don’t have much supply, so it’s kind of useless to me. Too bad I had really high hopes for this.
4	This unit works great.i love having a second USB port in the Explorer..
4	Doesn't say where the product is made either on the bottle or the box.
4	This products works well but it has an acquiring taste to it.
4	This wig is fantastic! The perfect Ash blonde color I have been looking for, super thick and long.
4	It is a good night vision for the price.if i go by you get what u pay for i believe this one is above better.hard to focus specially if u zoom in other then that once i got use to it i like it
4	I really liked this book, good story line, certainly different from most other alien invasion books. BUT large sections of rambling, it may seem like important information to the author, but you'd have to be a scientist to get enough from it. Big words do not make you sound intelligent! Lots of words stuck in randomly all throughout the book that not average everyday words, some are even rarely used.
4	It is true to the description. I ordered my normal size and it fit as expected.
4	Great for organizing for cables. Good amount of pockets and straps to store things
4	Good story. Characters are realistic and interesting. The plot has a lot of royalty stuff which can either be interesting or just TMI.
4	As described...I wear size 6.5 but purchased 7. They fit fine but wish I had gotten a 6.5
4	Took two people and two hours to assemble, but once completed is beautiful and a great value for the money.
4	Well made, confidence inspiring case for iPhone X. I like that the case stick to magnets, however that also means you can't use induction charging without shifting the metal plate to the top/bottom of the case... and I'd wonder if that is safe over the medium/long term.
4	Love this, I did think it was going to be a bit bigger (as in taller and wider) but still works great .
4	So we ordered this after researching our options for about a month. We decided on this one due to the different age children we have. Pro: Lots of options on how to use it. 27 ways to be exact. Easy to clean fabric, fluids seem to slide right off and not stain. The bench seat is really nice for older children. Super large basket underneath Cons: Fairly long stroller, it does help to have the extra wheels to help with maneuvering. The wheels on the bag (attaches to the stand up board) is fairly load when strolling in sidewalks with cracks. It is very large folded up and you have to take the seats off (this makes it take up the entire truck area of our Ford Flex) Overall this is a great stroller for families with children that range in age. Stroller feels very sturdy and moves very easily just takes time to get used to the longer frame. We bought this from the Amazon Warehouse so we got a great deal on it so we can’t complain for the price we paid.
4	Installed this set on my atv. Product comes in nice and neat packaging. The whole setup is plug and play with a relativly easy install as long as your patient with hiding the wires. App works great and the lights will come on the same color you turned them off. Led housing is stout material that i will enjoy torture testing in the mud! Only 4 stars because the wires are way to long for atv's and would be very difficult to cut and shorten. Had to ziptie lots of extra wire up out of the way.
4	They are what I wanted for form/function but one of red style will not turn off
4	Bigger than I expected but does the job. Even though my dog has mastered the bowl already, she is still eating at about 1/10 the pace she did before buying the bowl.
4	Suction was good not great. I needed more
4	Great product makes the Echo portable and we use it around our pool
4	Because they left off a few oldies. BUT best singing group in the 70s.
4	This book is well written and fun to read, although not terribly suspenseful or thrilling. The characters are well developed and likeable and the plot is good.
4	Great quality and performance. They sound great and I find that I don’t need to turn the volume up very loud because of how well the isolation works. I even put them through the washer and dryer and they came out fine. My only issue is that after using them for about 20 minutes they start to hurt my ears and i have to remove them for a few. I’m not sure why this is but I guess it has something to do with how long the foam tips are... any solutions?
4	Purchased as a gift. Fun patterns for the holidays. The socks are true to size. I would give 5 stars but the socks are not as thick as I expected.
4	I totally love this pattern and the fit of the bottoms, they fit perfect and come up to the perfect height. BUT! Holy cow is the top SMALL!! I'm disappointed that I won't be able to wear it, because it's so cute. And when I mean small I mean totally ridiculously small in the cup area. I don't think they could cater to anyone outside of a C cup and a C cup might be too big of a fit too :( I ordered the 5x because I didn't want it super tight, like I said, bottoms fit great and comfy but the top is WAYYYY too small..... Bummer!
4	Thin pages cause a bit of trouble when reading, but still would recommend.
4	Great size for price
4	The book read fast and easy but was hard to get through the blood and guts. This was more a horror story than a mystery. Too much violence for me.
4	She feels it's tight in the crotch and she's not unusually long as regards her frame. She doesn't like how it cuts into her rear section. Good fabric, easy to get on and off.
4	It was exactly what I ordered
4	Its a lityle smaller then i thought i got it for my Nintendo switch
4	I was initially very pleased with this product because of the flexibility in adjustments. Easy to install. My only issue with this product is that you could actually remove the angle mount from the wall with standard screwdrivers. Typically the only way you could remove a ring doorbell would be with the special screwdriver provided by ring.
4	Kind of expensive for the product but It does work as advertised. Also a bit flimsy. You need to be careful with them. NOt fragile but definite not rugged
4	Biotin. Labdoor.com rates this brand pretty high. If biotin is part of your daily supplements try this one.
4	Protected well, although moisture did get in really easy. Mine however didn't last long, but it did it's job. Was wearing watch when arm got hit and screen protector shattered and not my watch face! Sadly it only lasted a month, but went down doing its job!
4	Been using them for several months and they are light and you can hardly notice them in your ears. Have 2 now, one for both places.
4	It recharged my iPhone SE twice on a single charge. When recharging the power bank, make sure you use the cord that came with the product.
4	I like the boots only a little too big. Will have to wear extra thick socks.
4	I like this box, when it's wired right a little light pops on to show you which fuse has blown.
4	Great wireless head phones. I love the sound quality. I lost my other pair and these are very comparable.
4	Use on my Porter Cable heat gun to concentrate the flow of air. Works great!
4	This is an excellent dryer for long, dense hair. It will cut your drying time in half. However, if you have medium or fine hair the dryer seems too strong, it doesn't create the lift and volume you get with other dryers. But again, it's excellent for heavy hair.
4	The headlights are great they really give good light the only problem is I had one that went out and it took forever for them to solve the problem I bought a new set and it got here before they send me the replacement one but they're really like the area good
4	As well as could be expected for the price. Not the best, not the worst, just right. Pro: Bamboo Con: Not as sturdy as I would like. Can tip a little.
4	This pillow allows your neck to stay firmly in place (no head bobbing!) and it is super soft, has no odor, and came nicely packaged. I gave it four stars because it was hard to figure out how actually get into the correct position despite step by step directions. The directions need a real life picture of the final position you are trying to get the pillow in.
4	I broke my iphone screen after only weeks. After it got repaired I put this protection on and no problem. It still looks clear resolution.
4	No additions. Just the stitching. Really cool. Like a great deal.
4	It does what it is supposed to do.
4	The item that I got from you guys broke after 1 month and it says AMC on AMC off AMC on AMC off it never stops
4	I got this to use on a Stokke Tripp Trapp tray. This does suction with the extra base after wetting down the tray and area between the base and the bowl. However, if the base/bowl are dragged along the tray, they do lose suction. And my 8 month old was very interested in pulling at the tab on the base so only works with that facing away from him. Suction doesn’t last the whole meal so be prepared to press down again. Still, this lets me give yogurt and applesauce more easily with baby led weaning. The bowls and lids nest for easy storage. I almost returned these before I tried wetting things for more suction. These didn’t stick well to my wood table, and I wouldn’t wet that down so I wouldn’t use these on a wood grain.
4	The color is very pretty. But it started chipping in 3 days. So a bit disappointed in that
4	I love the fit of this top. It is super soft as well.
4	I wish the bag had a little more padding to protect the light table but other than that everything seems to be in good order and I wish it came with a wall adapter it only comes with the cord
4	Light hearted and romantic . Not realistic, but a great story. Easy characters to get to know. The books are great individual stories, but the three book set is a treat.
4	Big sound from such a compact system. I'm pleased 😊
4	good price waiting for it to be instock.
4	Instructions are very thorough, and it comes with 2 of everything needed (which is rare). Application was very easy and honestly one of the best feeling protectors I've ever used. Feels like I'm using the actual screen. Only issue is keeping dust from sticking to the adhesive side of the protector before you can get it applied. Hard as I tried (removed, cleaned and reapplied 3 times), I couldn't get a 100% dust free application. However, it is bubble free adhesion like the listing states.
4	Is very nice and comfortable.
4	I like it but the formula is kinda hard to get out when your trying to make a bottle supper fast but other than that it's exaclty like the picture shows. spacesaver for travel.
4	These fit the machine as described, came in good packaging no scratches, they only reason for a 4 star is the passenger side door was bent out slightly at the bottom, but still did the job. great product
4	Good fit, a little low on the waist though. I usually wear the carpenter jeans but Carhartt is changing its product lines more for fashion then work gear. Straight leg is great and fits over the work boots. Plenty of room even with winter boots. Definitely buy another pair
4	Not the most stylish but works well got intended purpose and has held up.
4	This iPhone 11 wood grain case looks very classy and I really like the design of it overall. It was simple to place the phone in the case. It fits well. My only question now is how durable it will be both in time and when I drop it - I needed a case that protects the phone and this one claims to do that. Again, it's very nice looking case.
4	was what i excepted nice
4	Good quality, super small though. Could be my fault, maybe I over estimated the size of 5oz.
4	These socks with treads fit well. My only issue is the placement of the non skid rubber bumps. They are placed primarily on the arch of the foot area. That area is the least used and caused the heel area to be more slippery. The toe area would have helped with crawling but was again slippery. They are very cute and the strap helps keep them on the feet.
4	Quality of the glasses.
4	I enjoy "adult" coloring. Definitely a good source for colors. The only draw back is the packaging. The pens fit into a thin plastic tray which is difficult for me to use due to arthritis in my hands
4	Smells SO good, and really cleans my dogs' paws after the dirtiest of walks. Only fall back is that these go VERY quickly.
4	nice hat keep my head and ear warm without worry about the wind
4	A little unresponsive using touchscreen through the plastic and the Velcro has to be positioned “just right” to not poke into my arm. Other than that- works great and I’m very pleased!
4	Exactly as expected, maybe better.
4	Very nice fit the money.
4	An Excellent Movie! Animation dated, but the storyline can live on forever. My daughter found this on Prime used to watch it, she said 100 times, so I know it was a lot. I watched it to remember, but I didn't. Still, the kid that lives forever in my heart enjoyed it and was so glad to have watched it, whether the first time or 100 times.
4	haven't watched much of it yet. I watched it when it first came on tv
4	I use in my truck for working on a laptop.
4	If your consistent with it you’ll see the it helps if you work out too
4	Works well with my portable saw...
4	Used this item to remove acrylic, water-based paint from plastic models. It removed the paint very nicely (with some help from an old toothbrush) with only a quick 5-minute soak, and evaporated afterward making cleanup a breeze! It's great stuff for this purpose and the price isn't too bad for the amount you get. The only downside to this is it's a bit picky about stripping other types of paint, particularly if that paint has been sitting for a very long time (wouldn't work on 9+ year old paint).
4	I like that the case looks just like the picture and it came in a very nice box. I feel that it is a little over priced but we’ll see how it holds up. Color is a tiny bit off but looks very similar to the real case. I don’t like that it have a chemical smell, I will let it air out for a few and hopefully it goes away.
4	It looks awesome! It's just a bit small but that's to be expected considering the price.
4	Now that we go everywhere with a cell phone in your pocket, we needed a small cell phone or key shelf in the restroom, and this is perfect, easy to install and easy to use.
4	I like them also no reveiw 4 the workout thing cause im fat. :p
4	Set looks great, seems like it will be fine, BUT the the front left hand slot for the Santoku knife was not cut big enough. Looked for a place online to contact the company, but could not easily access one, probably due to the fact item was sold by amazon. Did not want to pack up the entire set and send it back just for that, so my husband had to enlarge it. See pics
4	Works great,bu I wish it could charge for longer hours.
4	Grandson really enjoyed this gift plus there’s extra card stock to design your own shield
4	Good product, it will do the job
4	There is no real scent to this was, just a pink color. It did a very good job when I use it but for some reason it did not heat as quickly as many other wax beads I've tried in the past.
4	I love that there is a pleasant smell and that it's gentle on the skin
4	This blanket is made of the usual Carhartt duck material that they use in their bibs and their sherpa material on the other side. The duck material is very durable and will last through years of abuse, while the sherpa material is very comfortable. I got it for my dogs to use around the house and on camping trips and they seem to like it so far. It seems a little pricey for the size and I would love to see it come in larger sizes, but I knew what I was getting when I ordered it, because the dimensions are clearly listed. I will say, the duck material bleaches out pretty quickly if left in the sun (as learned from leaving my Carhartt bibs in my Jeep for a few weeks), so be aware of that.
4	2 reasons for 4 star first is it's too white. That might sound silly but it's even whiter than the face plate it comes with it so white it's extremely noticeable. Second it's really loud it ticks like an old dang clock.
4	Works good, I should have paid attention to the size, had to drill it out to fit my hose.
4	The only thing I dislike is the mold seam. But what are you gonna do? If they were flawless, they’d be $250. They’re incredible for the cost. But two sets.
4	Nice comfortable, inexpensive and sturdy shoe I purchased to work around the house in lieu of tennis shoes or boots. A bit low in front but that's more an issue of taste rather than function.
4	Good book. Good character development. Somewhat gory. Shows a lot about the mess that our legal system is in. Not in the same author class as Lee Child and John Sandford but I would buy and read another of Trainer's books.
4	I have an s5 replaced to s9 the value is worth the price well made and fuctional Good buy
4	Really good book for beginners. Weight Watchers is a great dieting program that is going to help you to lose weight in a safe and effective way. It contains various delicious and super healthy recipes for everyday meal. Absolutely worth getting in your cookbook collection.
4	I want to be comfortable when I come home and throw on some sweat pants. Too often they feel like leggings and are uncomfortable. These are perfect! Not too baggy, not too fitted. The size medium was just what I was looking for. The pants are a medium weight. I'm going to order another pair.
4	I got the impression that they might stain, but then they washed up pretty well. We haven't used them a lot yet but she enjoyed cutting zucchini and with some assistance carrots.
4	If you have a lot of make up or brushes, SKIP. It does not hold many brushes at all and I wish the shelves were a bit deeper/taller so I could fit certain things in easier. I do not want to talk bad about this product at all as it IS made pretty well and does exactly what it says it does, it just doesn't work 100% for me. I use it to hold my "daily" items I use and have a larger box for the rest. Like I said, it is great for light/new make up users.
4	So it was “nice” for a week. I don’t know if my cats just went wild or what but that baby is looking rough. We have like 3-5 scratchers at any given time. Lots of items for the cats to play with and this thing just got SHREDDED. It could be a little more dense cardboard. It was good for the price however. I used hot glue to hold some of it together and it may get another 4 weeks. My cats love it and it’s cute.
4	This was a very good series more than worth the .99 it cost. For those who like a good paranormal romance and mystery you will enjoy this book.
4	The last 4 bags we have received have arrived ripped open in the box. If this continues I will buy locally
4	Can’t complain about the earphones, love the fact you can replace the cord if it was to get damaged. That is smart. The padding on the headrest could have been better. Sound is nice! I tested this with my USB headset, this one wins it. The cons of these headphones are it makes my ears warms after 5 minutes of use. The cord it comes with it is short, but I have extensions. I did not buy this for the microphone, so I cannot tell you how good or bad it is. Is it worth the money? Yes. I go though headsets if there is no tomorrow and I was tired of paying top dollar for them. I have a standalone microphone, and now these headphones.
4	It works I like that it auto shuts off.
4	My husband is the coffee drinker and he really likes this blend the best.
4	Not bad for the price. Was not too difficult to assemble.
4	It is true that it pays itself. it matches my coffee shop's theme which is retro. It is bright even in broad daylight. You can only imagine its beauty at night time. Definitely worth it.
4	I purchased this jacket in a small and it fit sort of tight. I then purchased a medium only to get shipped another small without a good and was told I would just have to reorder. Now that I try to reorder the medium is no longer available. Unhappy with the way Amazon went about my return of the wrong item. I loved the first jacket if only it was in the size that fit me.
4	The installation of the weather-stripping is fairly straightforward. It takes a bit of strength but once you get the hang of it goes pretty well. I used the plastic screen installation tool. Getting the old weather-stripping out of the track is somewhat tedious, putting the new weather-stripping is "fun".
4	I'm tentatively hopeful about my aerogarden. I've taken a chance on in spite of the poor reviews. I was impressed with the ease of set up. It has a timing function for the lights and a light that will let you know when it's time to feed the plants. I re-purposed two of the pods with seeds of my choosing, because I don't use a lot of dill or curly parsley. Fingers crossed any of the plants sprout! Expect an updated review if I can get anything to grow.
4	Nice little lights for craft projects. Work well.
4	So excited to get these. Love the grate in the bottom to allow circulation and the lids to keep things fresh. Looking forward to organizing our fridge with these.
4	worked once the unit was configured. Much cheaper even with buying the tool to configure.
4	Really nice magnetic calendar. It looks great on the fridge and I love the layout. The way the calendar was packaged, however, left dents at the top where the markers were pressing.
4	As a 11 year old youngster I loved this book with its stunning pictures along with accurate drawings of the Wings of Fire dragon tribes, however some scenes of violence may be graphic for young readers like me such as dragons killed in gruesome ways. All in all, I did enjoy this graphic novel even though I don't particularly like graphic novels but I hope you like it too random reader. waffles
4	I wish they were wider. I put two on the same side and have to set them at different levels to fill the gap.
4	My dog tears things up so easily and even Kong cannot keep up with her. However, these last at least a week or two depending on her moods when she is playing.
4	The top and bottom flex back easily, the rubber is a softer rubber than most 2 part cases like this. but other than that it is a great case, great color, have not dropped it but it seems as protective as similar style cases. and its griped which is good
4	Liked the soft fabric. So far it hasn’t pilled like other shirts from other brands.
4	Installation was a bit of a pain, but it seems like a good product.
4	Good product has been a month and feel like it’s been helping! Ordered more.
4	It holds everything together, but it gets tight as you add a few cards. I was hoping it would be a little slimmer. It's working, but might look for something else.
4	The slots for files only really allow for one file folder, and I was hoping to have a wider slot for at least two file folders. It is great for those of us that have limited desk space for files, but if you need easy access to more than 5 thicker files, I would order more than one. Other than that it is perfect.
4	Make sure you know that it's very tiny. The picture is very misleading. ....cute though. Mine was on the light orangy side. Not as orange as I thought it would be, but it is in the "orange" family..... Can be a nice gift.
4	Honestly, you get what you pay for. Pan thickness is very thin... you can easily distort the shape... Edges are not rolled, like traditional pans, so be careful when handling! Box arrived (like other reviewers stated) damaged (and the outer box it shipped in was not). Ultimately they worked okay, so I will keep them. (It's not often I have a use for a sphere/hemisphere cake anyway). I will just have to be very careful about storage so they don't get misshapen!
4	This wig is by far the best wig ive gotten that was curly ... The hair is pretty an very soft ... Doesnt tangle or mat up very little shedding no smell to nothing .... The issue I had was they did send a 16inch like I requested. They sent me a 10 inch curly maybe 12 inch ... It took to bleach and coloring very well OVER all the wig is a great wig if you like THAT curly hair .... I would buy this hair again
4	Smaller than I thought but does the job I wanted it for. Cheap throw away towels for spills in the garage and a couple time use hand towel for the garage sink.
4	I only wish it were taller, love the logo on both side, otherwise I would buy again.
4	This works great and a much better price than name brand! I ended up buying a second one I liked it so much. So far has held up well for about a month. One if them occasionally decides it can't understand me (maybe once a week) but if I unit and plug back in it's fine.
4	I really enjoyed this story. The simple investigation of murder by an unlikely pair is both interesting and fun to read.
4	have bought in the past and will again.
4	Arrived in good shape and installed quickly (with help from a more knowledgeable friend, a lot less stressful that way). Took about 10 minutes from opening the box Sound is much better than flat screen downward facing speakers. Sound not quite as good as I hoped, but I am hard of hearing so it might just be me. Also, have to fiddle with TV to get rid of some of the base (I hear treble better). I am happy with the purchase and would do it again.
4	The case itself is super durable. I really like it a lot. The screen protector could fit the full screen though, instead of just the visible part. And the kickstand is basically garbage. It broke the first time I tried to use it. All that being said however, I would absolutely recommend the case on it's own. It's as good as any I've ever used.
4	A little smaller than I expected, but it does a good job at thoroughly cleaning my brushes. Also makes the process go by faster.
4	So I got the 2 pack, one size , tried on the navy- perfect fit lovely and now took out black once - small ! How are you guys packing it? 2 pack- same size please ! I will give the smaller one to my sister - too much hassle at this point , great buy for money and if you get lucky maybe you will get both pairs actual size you order
4	Really nice clips. A little tricky to use outdoors on the clothesline as they are a little small and can twist and pop out of your fingers, especially if it is a cool day.
4	The wallet is good but they can rebuild it in a better more effective way.
4	Water drains quickly
4	I bought this new in the summer of 2019, we'll see how it holds up. So far it seems to be doing juts fine. It carries my surface pro and other materials easily, could also fit a laptop if needed.
4	I ordered wrong since, will need to return for 2T.
4	Purchased this for a legally blind friend in her 90's. I wish the channel and volume buttons went down and up instead of left and right. She knows down and up, but cannot remember left means down and right means up. I would rate this 5 STARS except for the directional problem she is having. It would make more sense if the buttons were vertical instead of horizontal. Hope this makes sense.
4	I liked this book a good deal. Takes a few pages to get into, but the story progresses nicely and I do like the universe and the characters. I recommend it.
4	The magnet is perfect! Holds the ipad great no slipping. I bought one for mu husband.
4	A bunch of leather scraps. I got a couple pretty good size pieces so lots of options to make things out of. This is chrome tan leather so keep that in mind, I didn't know the difference between chrome tan and veg tan when I bought them.
4	Purchased as present for sister. She loved it! Good, solid umbrella, easy to open and close, very pretty.
4	I am a small female and injured my knee earlier this year. I bought quite a few braces. This one fit better than most and i kept going back to it. I wish i could have gotten pink or white, tho- just my preference.
4	Glad I waited until I was ready to absorb this. Like I said, heavy. Kind of satisfying in a twisted, long drawn-out way. Mistakes time with tone. But I want one of those shrooms. No- I'd take a hillside for future reference...
4	A little clingy, but a nice shirt.
4	Solid construction. Setup is not bad. It holds several fingerprints, but sometimes does not open on the first try. If you are looking for quick response, do not get a fingerprint vault.
4	Packaging, instructions, finish, etc., are all good. Stream is fairly narrow.
4	Wheels would be helpful
4	Well made and does what it should.
4	I like the range and ease of use. The sound quality is not the greatest, but overall provides good value. I do not recommend using if you are also using walkie-talkies near by as the interference is significant.
4	Good size but item arrived chipped/broken. There were bits of glass inside the dish.
4	Took a while to receive but it's a nice, big towel-like blanket. Good for the beach or meditating on.
4	The story starts out slow but the back ground is needed to understand the gravity of the theft. The writing improves as the story evolves'
4	All Black, fit great even with mods. Wish I didn't have to sand of the bottom bump to remove mods.
4	Great product! Thick and smooth material.
4	Great keyboard works as listed. Quick shipping. .
4	Just received my 7 - 8 inch salt lamp. Arrived well packaged and in perfect condition. With the light on, it makes a nice accent piece day and night. Not sure if it's going to make me feel better and all that. Might end up being just a fad like pet rocks. But the light makes it look nice, and the dimmer works very well to adjust light level.
4	I read through it once to understand the message. I plan to go back through it and put it in practice. So I can’t say that it worked for me yet but I can say it was an easy read and interesting.
4	Boots are comfortable and nice!! They do smell like fake leather but for the price they are perfect
4	I bought this as a gift so I can' t answer all your questions sorry
4	This is a great game up to a point, sometimes a bit difficult.
4	It had all the features I was looking for the only thing I didn't care for was the band but I would by the watch again
4	this paint by number is wonderful! looks exactly like the photo.
4	Having read book 1 in this series, it was fun to see more of and get to know Doug, and also to learn that the problem in book 1 got resolved. I am not usually drawn to books with paranormal happenings, but I found Mina's gift believable. (Not the cookie connection, however!) I did not read this book as a romance, but rather an explanation of Mina's and Bernie's lives. I like happy endings, so was satisfied.
4	Really easy to install. I had a small problem with mine at first but customer service immediately sent me a replacement. Very good quality
4	Cute little carriers. Perfect for my smaller birds, for vet visits and traveling.
4	After replacing the new one, the air in my car become so much better. The only thing I don't like it the air flow is not as strong as I install before.
4	They work just fine and are exactly what is advertised. This headset really amplifies my gaming experience.
4	I wanted a smaller bottle BUT these will do for now I am sure I will use them,
4	The book started off slow. But, it was a page turner none the less because I was curious to know what would happen when she went outside. I did not expect the ending that it had!
4	So far look good I haven’t wore them yet but think they are going work
4	Nice large strong case BUT thought would be in red for easy spotting in suitcase. It's black with red interior. Also thought there'd be pockets/compartments-is just a large headphone case with a small mesh "packet." Eh.
4	I love the outdoors / chocolatey smell that this has. Thankfully this is light and not over powering. It is very hard to find this product locally and I was surprised to find that I could order it here.
4	This is wonderful for playing in the evening. If left outside it loses air frequently.
4	Living in Japan for 8 years, now that I'm back in the states made me miss that nightlife with hostess girls, and I was always fascinated with the Yakuza underworld and the family affected.
4	I really like this Light! My daughter has it hanging from the ceiling in the corner of her room and it looks awesome! I couldn’t figure out the music part so that why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5
4	Although the story adds little to our store of knowledge about the Middle Ages and few surprises, it is an entertaining tale.
4	Could be a little wider but fits well enough.
4	This author is one I know I can count on for a great read. This book is no exception. Miranda Montgomery has loved Dexter Kendrick since her family took him in when they were young. He's her brother's best friend and she's sure he doesn't know she exists. Dexter comes from an abusive family background and lives in fear he will become like his father. He believes he doesn't deserve Miranda, in spite of the strong attraction. He also knows her brother's will kill him if he makes any moves toward her, and especially if he hurts her. So he keeps his distance, maintaining a tight control on his emotions, until Miranda is attacked.
4	This app is perfect for those who want to create a professional looking resume in half the time. Although the templates are a bit dull, you can still create a great, professional style resume absolutely free.
4	I love tht it is waterproof but I would have loved it more if it had some side pockets to put smaller items in.
4	It is a great game and fun for the family. I wish it had more common songs.
4	Camps down hard so may damage your book during use, but as long as you don’t mind that it works great.
4	I liked the feel of it on my skin - not greasy--but don't forget to shake the bottle or the mineral oil does separate--so this is why i gave it only 4 stars.
4	Ok. Sturdy. Fits well.
4	Holds all of his arrows and he loves it
4	The remind me of the caramels we would get long ago in my childhood. They were fresh with a long range expiration.
4	Got this as a present for my mom. She says its a little cumbersome as it is big compared to a regular wine opener but she likes it!
4	This is my 2nd one and I love it for the price. All it could use is a strap on this or the holding case. I don't wear a belt all the time so the belt style loop on the carrying case is not practical.
4	Nice Scissors but they were huge and thirty with scuffs marks as if they were laying around the floor. Not happy about that.
4	This is much prettier in person with a mix of gold and pearls, white and off-white. The problem with this is it’s topsy-turvy. We had to cut part of the stand portion because it would just tip over on the top of our tree. With that being said we were able to cut and adjust and make it work .
4	The only issue I really have with this pasta maker is that the part anchoring it to a counter is very small. I can’t attach it to my counter, so I either have to use the table outside of the kitchen and go back and forth or try to hold it down with one hand and crank with the other. Annoying but not terrible. The pasta turned out fantastic and the kids loved using it. A great addition to the kitchen gadgets.
4	Original pad is thicker but these are a good substitute just not as thick.
4	Arrived on time. Great for adding to slime!
4	1) order a few colors you think may work for you and see in person which matches. 2) use dry shampoo if you find it too shiny. 3) use thinning scissors if you find it too heavy. It looks very pretty and is totally worth the price.
4	Works and looks good as expected.
4	Awesome, arrived early. Great watering system for my sons 4H project.
4	This puppy is adorable, perfect for my two year old. We love how it is soft and simple. Super cute!
4	Good details about the Alamo . Some good information about the Alamo. But lacking information in other battles for Texas independence .
4	So, occasionally I find a crack/check mark in a piece of wood that would be expensive to just cut out or discard. Drilling into the crack and injecting glue is often a good option.
4	Very nice. It was a little tricky as it didn't come with instructions but I looked at pictures and figured it out. I, too, added more stones as I didn't get many stones with the purchase. However, I purchased some stones at the dollar store and they work great. I am experimenting with different amounts of water as I like the sound of the water trickle.
4	Nice book. Bought 4. A little religious, so I am not comfortable to give as gifts as I had hoped. Beautifully illustrated.
4	Initially really enjoyed the game but too repetitive in battles with human/vampire foes. Quit about 3/4's of the way through. did like the concept of the game.
4	Leaks a little bit great overall
4	only worked for a couple of weeks but found there was a screw that came loose works so far great
4	Great lightweight sun shade that doesn't take up much space. Easy enough to fold with some practice.
4	i like it but i thought it would be thicker, fit a little too exact.
4	The honing rod is great. As a cook in a hotel kitchen, I would recommend this for professional or home use. Because this one is such a fine grit, i would suggest possibly a diamond rod or a coarse ceramic as well.
4	Not bad. Beans are better than grounds if you have the tool to grind it.
4	Product as described.
4	Like everything about this product--especially that is is not greasy and doesn't get in your eyes like other kinds of sunscreen. I only wish it came in a little bigger size.
4	But very cute pattern
4	Easy to hang on door and durable. Perfect for shoes and heels. My only complain is that I wish it had more room for bigger shoes like boots. Other than that I am satisfied with the purchase. Thanks.
4	If you're looking for something to make mini-donuts that replicate the size and shape of Hostess mini-donuts (like I was), then this product will disappoint because they are about 1/2 the size of Hostess mini-donuts. However, I'm still giving this product 4 stars because it's excellent quality and would made a great mold for either homemade gummies or interesting ice cubes.
4	Came as described, unfortunately these are much smaller than I thought, I read 1/2 liter...even though it’s clearly written 1/5 liter. Oops! They are adorable and would probably be a great size for jams or bruschetta. Pint jar in pic for comparison
4	I love Wet brand brushes. They are gentle to the hair, wet or dry. They are sturdy but lightweight and feel good to my hand. And they come in many colors and designs. However this one in the pink flowers does not have an embossed "Wet" logo just beneath the brush area. All my others have it. In the pictures offered of this product, one shows it with an embossed "Wet" and another without. Also mine arrived with white nubs on the ends of the bristles, whereas one ad shows all black, while another shows white-tipped. My brush does say (in print, same as the pink flowers) "Wet brush" on its handle. I just want to make sure I purchased a legit "Wet" brand. Otherwise it seems like a good brush. I've had this particular one only a week, so I'm still trying it out. The way I clean and wash my Wet brushes is to pull out as much loose hair from them as I can with my hand. Then with a regular hair brush with soft bristles, I will brush it to remove the rest of the hairs, pulling them from the other brush. Or you could use a soft bristle scrub brush. Then I get both wet, put liquid soap on one and gently scrub the brushes together. That also brings up loose hair so you can grab and pull it out. Then I rinse both very well and dry upright on a wash rag. If you have thick curly hair or a lot of hair accumulated, you could try using the end of a rat tail comb down each row and pull up hairs before washing. Wet brushes seem to survive fairly hot tap water. Though I don't know I'd soak them in it. Likewise, I wouldn't put them in the dishwasher as some do. They might melt or the colors will fade away much faster than they normally would.
4	These are so cute! We bought them for our Frenchie puppy and they’re perfect. I would give 5 stars for quality in use for a dog, but I downgraded the rating to four stars because they are definitely not breakaway and not safe for cats. We didn’t purchase them for a cat though, so we’re pleased!
4	This is a nice quality pillow but a little to firm for us. I'm going to open it up and pull some stuffing out to make it work for us.
4	Came exactly how described/pictured Pleased with quality of makeup for my tween daughter!
4	My daughter loves Peppa. Unfortunately, this movie is just episodes from the show. I wouldn’t buy it if you watch a lot of Peppa Pig because you probably have seen most of it.
4	Love the flags. However I received two of the same Labor day flags and no Memorial day flag.
4	Christmas gift for grandson he loves you to read to him.
4	I bought this for my spouse who works outdoors. He really needs a more rugged case for those times but he said he is enjoying the slim build while still having protection for the screen. He has dropped the phone a few times and the case has done a great job of protecting it. The front bumper attaches to the back of the case. He really isn't concerned about the color but the black and blue go nicely with the phone (which is blue). It fit nicely so all buttons and camera work properly.
4	the customer service was wonderful. i ended up giving this to my mom who absolutly loves it. it made her happy.
4	Installed it minutes ago. Easy installation. Opened an existing xlr file in a few seconds. Incredible!
4	The credit card slots are very deep and I struggle to get the cards out. But overall the wallet is sturdy and nice
4	They seem like good quality panties, but I had to return them because they're a bit too small for me. I cant really say they're smaller than they should be for their size, because in my experience, each brands' sizes are different.
4	Works great when our pups are small. Our bigger pups would get excited and jump on the side and could knock it over. It is decent for the price.
4	It fit perfectly and the quality was excellent
4	I bought this when it was first released for $22 (since then the price has increased) and it is a great cat hammock at that price. I installed it as a centerpiece for my DIY cat tree and my boys seem to love it. One critique is that I wish the brackets were wider and used 4 mounting points each so I could then mount them under the wooden steps like a shelf vs. above. The current brackets are too weak to mount below and will cause wobbling. Overall pretty satisfied
4	The physical remote eats batteries and keeps disconnecting from the fire tv box. Was really happy to have found this app as it is so easy to use
4	Good quality Micro SD card. Purchased for a Nintendo Switch. Works as it should with plenty of storage space
4	I like the product and the seller, but they ship with FedEx. FedEx decided to change my address on the package to a place I haven't lived in 7 years. An honest person called me and I was able to go pick it up. My correct address was on there. Still don't understand it. Never had a positive experience with FedEx. The only reason I will not buy from the company again.
4	Just ordered this morning around 11am and got it before 8pm today. But I did the same day delivery. But still was happy about my product and I’am going to definitely order one for my mom as well. So thank you for your awesome service.
4	The tree is decent, except the only thing that is a pain is vacuuming up the fuzzies that come off after the cat scratches them off of the tree. And the top perch is a little too small, even for my 8 month old kitten. Other than that it's entertainment for him so I'm happy.
4	I like the idea of having my k-cups in Easy access and out of the way. However, I've had some problems keeping the cups to stay up out of the way. The shelf doesn't stay up in place
4	I am giving four stars because the print is not that bright as it shown in picture but it is not that expensive either so it works.
4	I agree with many reviewers that this book is a recycled version of the first one. Plus, it's hard to explain time-travel to a 4-year-old. I much prefer the original story. However, my kids (ages 2 and 4) LOVE this book. They will pick it over the first one almost every time. They think the diapers and the "tacos love dragons" pages are hilarious. They also love the last page, although the pictures include multiple cultural references that they don't understand. So, who am I to question a book that my kids love so much?
4	Overall I'm happy with these. I'm a software developer, and I use them 8 to 10 hours a day. The picture is sharp, the size is perfect, and I quickly adapted to the curve. Now that I'm used to the curve, I wouldn't want to work without it. My only complaint is the enormous power brick which cover adjacent outlets on my power strip. They probably could have come up with a better design for this. I ended purchasing a second power strip just for the monitors. Otherwise they're a great buy and I would purchase them again.
4	I am very glad I purchased this WIFI extender it really boost the signal in my basement. The reason I gave 4 stars was my router drops signal here and there. So at the moment I unplug the extender until I use my game room in the basement. But the product works very well. Would love to get a second one for upstairs.
4	Very comfortable brace, stays in place and great support. This thing is pretty awesome.
4	These worked very well for storing large blankets.
4	Works well, it does slowly deflate over an hour, so not good for long term stable propping. but for the short term adjustability it is really good.
4	Great everything works not damaged. Worth the buy
4	This feels more productive to use than manual toothbrushes. There are also many different settings so brushing is more catered to the user. I like it.
4	Works well (keeps my dry in a rain storm), is well made and far sturdier than the cheap plastic ones.
4	I have had these on my pillows for about 3 weeks, but have had to hand sew one where stitching did not hold up...they both look like they may need this done in other seams soon.
4	i ordered a 9 wide and a 10 for my friend. i tried in both and did not feel a difference. not the most comfortable for wide feet.
4	Good feel, great quality overall, only 2 buttons feel cheap
4	I havent rec'd the the product yet. Only purchased the cable portion. It will be nice to keep my lil dog in her seat in the car. Im also hoping to use the cable to tether her to the shopping cart seat for extra safety (her safety).
4	These are nice sheets, They washed well and didn't really look wrinkled after drying but they do wrinkle once used on the bed like most other sheets. Still a nice set they are soft and have a nice feel to them. They fit my foam mattress good without slipping off. Would recommend.
4	Have been enjoying this game.
4	Building new habits is one of the most challenging and most rewarding processes. I liked this way that what the author described here, all these are very effective techniques & easy to follow outlines. Read this guidebook right now to learn some easy, powerful strategies for changing your odd habits. Here you will get not only guides but also various essential tips, strategies, outlines, lessons and other related things. So dont leave without reading this such an amazing book.
4	I like the design, very cute. I like that it is glass. I wish it held more water. Overall a great product.
4	Works ok but I would suggest using a more heavy duty one.
4	Fit great not too small and not too big
4	It is slightly different color and texture than what I ordered. But it is good.
4	Nice soft cotton. Love the design of the monster. Nice & colorful. Washes great. I docked a star because my son is only 7 months old & his head is too big already, which makes me think it's the towel. The head flap needs to be quite a bit bigger, because the teeth won't allow for any natural stretch with the cotton. Maybe mine was sewn small, can't say if it's a problem for every towel. It's not a deal breaker for us. It's cute & we will continue to use it.
4	The stick is smooth and kinda slick, and the tip seems to be sanded and glows way more than the stick, so I sanded the whole stick the same way, and they seem to work better.
4	Love them for work and driving when it is not that sunny outside or working inside around metal like I do.
4	It did do a good job getting chlorine out of my hair after swimming but left my hair very dry. Washed dishes by hand well but left my skin dry even though I had diluted it (both for shampooing and dishes). I don’t usually have dry skin so I was surprised.
4	It's really good to have have little things like theses at home... this product is the same has the picture and the price is just right
4	Arrived quickly! Cute shirt for New Years Eve! I ordered the M in silver. Fit great although it is a tad bit short, but it will work. I am wearing underneath my leather jacket. Also the silver isn’t really shiny, it’s more of a matte but does have some sparkly to it. Overall I like it. :) For reference on the “M” size. I’m 5.5, weigh about 155 and a 34C.
4	It arrived on time. It was properly packaged, and appears to be correct. I have not used one yet.
4	Good bang for your buck !
4	Ordered 2 more just like it and they were much bigger than this one. Had to send back
4	I like this slim lightweight cover and it fits very well - kindle snaps right into place. The back folds and stands up so I can watch movies easily. The only negative is that it does not have the inner hand strap which I always use when reading so I may have to get another.
4	These fit my Challenger's seats very well. Much easier to install than other covers I tried. The only bad thing is there is no opening for the seat release lever. It is still a chore getting the straps under the seat. For the driver's side had to raise the seat as high and as forward as it would go to reach underneath with all the motors and wires.
4	This bridge stays in place fairly quickly well, very soft and seems very durable. My only complaint is wishing it was a bit wider as it can still slip in the crack as my husband and I have separate ergonomic adjustable beds. But overall, I'm very happy with this purchase
4	Works well to hold 9 oz cups for the players on my soccer team.
4	I love, love, love these shoes!!!. I read reviews before purchasing many online items and there were a lot of great reviews. So I dove in AND bought these little puppies and man I am so glad that I did. They are super-comfy and what I love best is the arch support. In the past, I've purchased shoes and my arches would really hurt after a long walk (4-5 miles daily). Nope not with these shoes. You will not be disappointed. Breathable and comfy, you can wear for daily casual wear with jeans or just for workouts and walks.
4	No complaints except now after a few months of having it it gets really hot and whenever hit a bump it stops working and says error. Still good though.
4	good product, took care of my problem
4	The fabric and fit are nice but the pockets are a bit too bulky for me. Just my personal preference. If it didn't have pockets I would probably buy extras.
4	The products are beautiful, the shipping was prompt, and their mission is fantastic. I love my new matt, block, and strap.
4	I was looking for a backpack for my first semester in college after many years, and I honestly didn't know what to look for. I just know that I wanted a backpack that was cute and stylish, and under $20. This backpack is it! Its material is a slightly shiny, smooth texture and has many pockets and hidden compartments, including one for my laptop. The straps feel really comfy, and it fits all my books, pens, and notebooks. My only complaint is that the backpack doesn't sit up on the floor, but its not a deal breaker for me. I would recommend this backpack to anyone.
4	First time user of cap/plugs and i was pleasantly surprised how well it helped for lap swimming. I bought this type of cap to get the over-ear coverage that other caps do not provide - find it rolls up a little as your neck is bending with your swimming (this could be my personal form being off though).
4	My 9 year old grand had fun with these on recent road trip
4	Super cute used it for a dress up business affair got a lot of compliments good value for the money
4	Shirts run a little large.
4	I now own these in 4 different colors. I gave it 4 stars because on one of the shirts the stitching was a little loose but over all a good buy. They are long enough to wear with leggings and cover your back end. The colors are just like pics.
4	Very nice, easy to set up. One drawer doesn't open very well though , there's is so much packaging , I filled 4 huge garbage bags of styrofoam
4	Reading this book for the second time, because there are so many helpful nuggets of wisdom. Like a great cookbook, this book is a valuable reference to help you develop your design organization. There are actionable insights to guide design leaders in refining their design organization, team structure and operations. It breaks down core areas and you can hop around to different chapters and dive into topics that are most relevant to you. Glad that we are elevating this discussion as the value of design organizations, to design deeper human connection to products and services, will be the great differentiator in the competitive marketplace. Thank you Kristin and Peter for writing this book. This is a keeper!
4	This is a great value. I bought this to use with my air fryer and it is perfect!
4	good little saw but broke the blade cover off after 2nd using . company quickly replaced it for free.
4	Doesn't shrink in wash with hang drying. No pilling or transfer of dye.
4	This game is dope as hell and the difference in the available gameplay modes is a big relief when it comes to breaking up the levels and making the game feel much longer.
4	Used it for the first time yesterday. I was very pleased that it went up about ten steps without any difficulty . Good product.
4	Like the value and understand that is always remains where you purchase.
4	Smells very good. My second time purchasing this cologne. Obviously just expensive as you are paying for the name Versace.
4	I had one battery that went bad. Company promptly answered my concern and sent a replacement. I appreciate that very much as Quality is first but Customer Service can resolve minor issues.
4	Convenient to be able to have multiple replacements on hand at a much more reasonable price. Water seems to taste as good when compared to the LG brand filters I used previously.
4	They are great in conjunction with my bone conducting headset.
4	Soft comfortable. We like cold sheets-percale hard to find! These come close!
4	Edges of clip a little on the sharp side. Rough on the hand or finger if clipped to pocket or belt loop. Dress down with a Dremel. Otherwise, works like advertised.
4	It works as advertised. I needed it for a small room addition and it works well.
4	They look great!! I just slid the covers over my old pillows and zipped them up and now my living room has a whole new look and feel. I love the design and feel of the pillow covers
4	This was a good product. I ordered it for Easter but it did not arrive on time. It was not the vendor's fault but rather the fault of the shipping company. The vendor accepted my return promptly and easily. I would definitely order from them again.
4	I ordered it and requested the 2 day free delivery, but did not get it until the next week. No explaination for the delay was given.
4	For the most part, these are fine. The first 2 on the top of the stack has small tears so I couldn’t use them. I wouldn’t say they rip easily so I’m not sure what happened to the shipment. The others all appear to be okay. The adhesive works well and seals properly. Bummed about losing 2.
4	This is nice. I didn’t realize it was for four slice toasters though so it’s way too big for ours. Gave it to a friend and she loves it. She says it keeps the grease and dust away when she cooks and likes that it covers the whole toaster.
4	Not quite as bright as I'd like but I do enjoy them
4	Would have given 5 stars, but the nylon zipper keeps getting stuck and is difficult to get it past the waist band. Otherwise and excellent value.
4	Works as expected. But they are hard to put on the buttons and then they can stretch too much and be ruined.
4	I have not had problems so far
4	Little lighter than i expected
4	There are a lot of diffuser's out there, and at this price point it would be hard to beat...my wife wants another one for her office..
4	I love, love, love these books. This was another great book by Hadena James. However, there was a bit of a problem with the editing. 5 stars once that issue is taken care of.
4	Great quality, soft luxurious feel and great for making a room DARK!
4	Not like the box matters as long as the items inside are there but the box was torn completely apart, other than that it is great!
4	I wore this on a long run recently. The material is more clingy than I expected but it was a good fit overall. The color is highly visible at night which is what I was looking for. I am satisfied with my selection of this product.
4	Won’t buy this brand again
4	For a short story, this was very compelling. Held my attention from beginning to end. The characters are intriguing, interesting and insightful. At this moment in my life a great reminder that we do not walk alone!
4	Very good quality and price. Very earthy, def unwashed. There was plant matter in the bag. I would def order again
4	I give this to my Daugter , is was to small for me
4	It’s not an absolute necessity but it’s nice to have. I like to go outside to walk 5-10 min with my 17 lbs baby without the ergobaby or a stroller. After a while, the five months old baby gets heavy so it’s nice to own this. I have a small waist but it fits nicely. The side position does not fill too well but I hope to figure that out. It takes up some space but for $22, you cannot go wrong.
4	Good color selections. Wish the black elastic strap was neutral color instead of black. Overall it does the job and the color selections
4	If you want to try ditching the cage to see how you like playing with a visor, this is perfect for that. afterwards you can get the better stuff.
4	I am pleased with the product, but I expected a larger quantity .......... very small container about the size of a US Nickle, if used sparingly you can get 2-3 whole long nails out of this amount. So if you expect to do more you will require to have a few more in your supply.
4	My son loves his backpack and that it glows in the dark.
4	I love pocket decks in a tin, and this one really appeals. It is Thoth-based, but with added RWS imagery in the minors. I can't give it 5 stars because some of the cards have light horizontal streaks - a printing error. It's not perfect, but I'll enjoy reading with the deck even so.
4	I love this and will buy it again. It smells so good. Don’t spray it directly on your clothes as the oil will stain.
4	Needed some notepads for the fridge and liked this design. They hold well and tear easily. Only complaint is that it’ll take us like 6 years to go through 6 pads. Wish they sold them in a smaller bundle.
4	The king size works pretty well. My partner just doesn’t roll them up her calves as the tops are too narrow for her.
4	what size cotton refills does it take
4	Just received this phone. Very big screen, easy set up. Pretty much like any other Android phone. It's very responsive and has not skipped a beat from my prior lg g5 phone which I sent back due to a warranty issue. I love the 64 GB storage as I'm tired of fighting my lg g5 for room on the phone. Also, the battery lasts forever. It takes decent pictures but I do need a little more time with the camera to write a complete review. Over all a very surprisingly decent product!
4	I read Little Lies by Michelle Brown, in the Just Breathe Anthology. "Breathe, you can do this. You can make it without the release. Just breathe, you won't shatter without it." It's a short story about pressure and release. Daily pressure from family, friends and social media. Release. Seeking release in the form of control. Finding something that you feel you have control over, in a life that you can't control. It's too short for my liking, but I did like the story. It's very informative, and emotional.
4	It's well made and I enjoy it, but really wish the card slot for a picture ID opened to the top and not to the middle. For as often as a person may have to get your license out, its a freakin' hassle! Otherwise, good product.
4	I may have missed reading this, but be aware this product appears to contain a large proportion of sawdust, much like a very tough plastic wood. This is great if you need filler, but if you're mating finely matching parts, the bulk gets in the way. Instead use a traditional furniture epoxy. (Sears sold some of the best I've ever used.)
4	Still highly entertaining, but this felt like a big placeholder and bridge from one story to the next. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if the next installment is set 20-50 years or more into the future on Safehold.
4	This is a sturdy board book, with a fun storyline and beautiful illustrations. The picture quality could be a little better, but it's great for the price and ought to hold up even under my toddler's tough love.
4	Great knife, I have had it fie a short time. The only complaint is with the keeper to hold it in the pocket, other than that I am pleased.
4	Whilst I found the topic difficult to read, it was nonetheless immensely satisfying as I continued with the story. A must read.
4	Looks good, shoots good, only complaint.... it’s all plastic, except for the barrel.
4	the variety pack arrived repacked in other kind of KIND bars boxes but I did receive the assortment as advertised.
4	Case is good and durable. Screen protector is junk. Its flimsy and terrible.
4	For tea in a bag is good
4	It looks great! The most outstanding feature is the choice of color which makes my bag stand apart from other garnet bags. This is a good addition to my quick travels when I need a few changes and allows me to carry my longer dresses without having to bunch them at the bottom of the garment bag.
4	What can I say? They fit, they're comfortable, and only time will tell if they're durable, but by then they probably won't be made by the same manufacturer or they won't be available any more. Big business sucks.
4	Works well for mid-cycle filter of oil for partial replacement of fry oil.
4	I love this shirt, looks just as the pic, nice soft material, fits true to size. I would recommend this product
4	Perfect little clover stamps about the size of a nickel
4	Really nice bowls, but the size was surprising. They are quite small. Good quality though.
4	Very cute with nice loves scenes. She could or should have been more prepared. Nice light reading. Didn't read the other stories.
4	Smaller than what size she actually wears as in size number not quite right. Nice quality though
4	nice looking unit well made but sound could be much better
4	This is a great cup and feels sturdy in your hands. Only con is that the straw is a little flimsy and could be upgraded to just a little better straw. The wording is printed on the cup which is nice as well instead of a decal.
4	Not very durable, but okay considering its price.
4	All the warming beads? are on the bottom. Nothing on top. Works pretty ok
4	The first part is very funny, and throughout there are sections. I got bored in some of the typical life stuff, that's because I'm old and have experienced them.
4	I enjoy this series.
4	Really cute hat, especially for that price. It fits a bit small for my average size head.
4	Decent quality for what you pay, have since passed it on to a friend and is still working after the years.
4	Most are just on the cusp of real horror, and a few are downright "huh?" material, but all are intriguing and completely literate. I intend to read more by Blair Daniels in novel form because some of the stories seem to be cut short to stay within the format, and think she may do better in an expanded form.
4	Greasy didn't wash out completely
4	Cute, smaller than I expected but will be good for feeding the grandbabies!
4	It is perfect. Shipping was on time. No issues with it at all.
4	I would Like this more if it didn’t sag off of my pack and play. But it does the job and is sturdy
4	Another good read by isabelle peterson, I can't wait to check out the other stories, job well done.
4	Beautiful, thin and protective, but it fell apart after less than 3 months. The silicon peeled off and it cracked on the sides and had to be replaced. UPDATE Torras reached out to replace the broken case, great service! Similar case to the Apple one, at a quarter of the price.
4	Comfortable. Lightweight material.
4	I love the concept and all the bright sparkly swirly colors This brand offers. But for me personally it was too clunky I'm used to more flexibility in the soul
4	A little bit big, but very cute.
4	Incredible world-building in this excellent novel crossing fantasy and the mundane. Wonderfully descriptive and imaginative, Nix easily leads the reader through the magic, history, and inhabitants of the world he has created. I'm definitely looking forward to reading other books in this series.
4	This is my first read by Belle Brooks and I totally enjoyed this story. I don't like to post spoilers so I'll just say that Marcus' and Abigail's story has a lot of twists and turns, surprises, and nothing is as it seems. It also is a story of great love. This is part 1 and the way it ended had me screaming for more! Can't wait to read part 2!
4	Storage capacity is great! Very well built, seems to be durable overall. The only problem was that it has missing one of the end cap bolt, so I had to go and buy one.
4	Great knife for the money. As other reviews have noted, this is a bulky knife. Not something you’d want to carry in your pocket everyday. Blade is nice and solid/thick, and sharp, but the action is not as smooth or lightening fast as I was hoping it would be. Overall, solid everyday work knife for sure!
4	This guide starts with the basics and will teach you everything you need to know including how to make an account and how to customize your avatar.
4	Although I'm worried that the 2nd replacement b/t transmitter also died after using it for about 4 hours each evening for about a month, the replacement does work well to power b/t earphones with quality sound. Also pairs easily with the earphones. If it continues to function I will be satisfied. I must say that the SunValley /TaoTronics customer service is 1st rate!
4	This is a beautiful purse but was, unfortunately, much too big for me. Would love it if it were smaller. Check the measurements before ordering.
4	I liked the product, but after receiving it I realized it will not hold up outside so returned. Alto, the boxes came in broken with large holes.
4	Its easily to view the scratches but it protect your phone good as my husband using it for almost a yr i guess its protect his phone from everything..
4	Nice paints take way too long to dry.
4	I started one week ago. I only take one pill, but I have to say I’m feeling weird but I’m a good way! I’m not fatigued during the day and I have spurts of feeling happy. So we’ll see
4	In what is obviously designed to be the kickoff to a series, this is a fun, quick read. Characters are a bit cardboard, but when you want desert chases, tomb raiders and not to think too hard it's a great deck read.
4	Works great. The battery doesnt last crazy long but it gets the job done. Overall works just as advertised.
4	Good quality, easy to put on. A bit long.
4	This is just what I needed. It arrived on time, without any damage, and very little set up required. I only gave it four stars because the chain and hardware that allows for the movement of the sewing machine height it’s self is a bit flimsy and my husband replaced some of it himself to be sure it holds up. It is exactly what I need, it isn’t taking up too much room, but has been a great purchase.
4	Funny, material feels good - can't wait to see how it holds up in the wash but happy so far.
4	Excellent product - very comfortable - suction cups come off after 2nd use.
4	I thought they had a no slip back
4	I bought this for by daughter’s first birthday party. We had a bunch of kids coming to it so we needed something to keep them engaged while the adults caught up with our stuff. It was really comfortable for the kids to use and they had great fun. But the bottles themselves had very less liquid and the last 1 cm of the liquid was not accessible by the retune. And the bottles lasted only like 5 minutes if you constantly kept blowing bubbles. It kept the kids engaged for around an hour. Luckily we had a lot of balloons which diverted the kids after a while. But overall it is a good party item and we also get refills.
4	Love the idea. Just some pulps and stuff get stuck in the seams and hard to wash... would love a more detailed cleaning instruction !
4	Works as expected. One star off as there is no cable management.
4	Pretty good underwear little itchy tho. Have yet to see how they hold up washing and Drying
4	I've been using these for quite awhile. It really cuts down on cat box odors when used daily.
4	Kids are having fun realizing that there are toys that so not take batteries. Cheaply made but what I expected at this price
4	I was expecting a heavier more well made piece of machinery. It seems cheap but has held up beautifully. Makes sandwiches perfectly every time(unless I am heavy on the PB and J). It kind of sucks to clean when there is too much PB.
4	This is a slick little display that works just fine.
4	Got here on time, great product but where I insert SIM card it’s broken as in where you use the SIM card opener a piece of it is missing other than that it’s a great product. Battery life could be a little better.
4	installed in 2017 Jeep Wrangler. low beams are way brighter than factory. high beams only marginally brighter. worth the price.
4	I've been taking one of these a day, with lunch, for several months. These seem to work well, but they don't solve my issues with gluten intolerance. The price through Subscribe and Save is comparable to buying from Costco.
4	Worked fine in the XLR 100 video camera I needed to shoot video on. Decent amount of memory space.
4	mic works just fine ,
4	Very easy to stick to the wall. Almost like a magnet! Also had to take three off during the process to move them. Came off easy. And easily reused
4	Basically a remake of 'Point Blank' with Lee Marvin
4	Haven't installed them yet but they seem sturdy enough, no wobble on the wheel.
4	I like to use as a night light
4	Came in time very nice
4	I originally bought one of these over a year ago when I lived in an apartment. Now I have a house and needed more. Bought the 3-pack. I did have to remove the 3 screws on the bottom and rotate the plug 180 degrees so it would work in my outlets. The first one I bought last year was the right way, but these were upside down. Mind you, I know that is because the old standard in the US was ground on bottom and the new standard is ground on top. I deducted one star because they should be able to update this design to accomodate a 180 degree rotation (or offer two versions), instead of me having to disassemble and rotate the plug myself. It is very simple to do, tho. Reversed all 3 of these in about 5 minutes. Anyway, I love these otherwise. They work as intended (I don't use the nightlight portion).
4	Great item that I use to clean my hair once a week.
4	Good quality. Really liked that the size of the track can be adjusted to fit a larger or smaller space depending on preference.
4	Good .. It fits well. But feels little but mushier keys. Its good for protecting the keyboard from spills. But might decrease the typing experience.
4	I've used this to speed up the time required to bring water to a boil for beer brewing on a gas burner. It will heat 5 gallons of water on it's own, but not to boiling in my tests.
4	Really cool, sometimes you need go over a couple times
4	As expected. I have purchased this item before.
4	Would have been five stars, but there is an unsightly seam that runs down two sides of the glass, where I guess they were molded together. Otherwise a good buy.
4	Most of the workouts are advanced. Not for beginners or apartments if people below you.
4	Great fit and very comfortable.
4	Fit well. Wiring diagram not included but written on small letters on the wires themselves ( wiah i saw that earlier:( ..? )on harness. Installation was fine, had to cut out back end of the old beetle radio slot to make new one fit. Overall happy with product!
4	This is a very fun game!
4	Use these in my bento, and they work just fine. I hand wash them since I don't trust itty bitty things in my dishwasher. The rectangles are really small. Haven't tried them for baking and probably won't, so I've no idea how well they'll work for that. Cute and I like the bright colors!
4	For some reason I had a hard time finding something that will hold both electric toothbrush heads and waterpik heads. These days when both these products are so common in households, I'm surprised it's not easier to find. Luckily this product will hold both electric toothbrush heads(works on every brand of electric toothbrush I've had such as oral b and sonicare) as well as waterpik heads for both myself and my wife. It's very simplistic but could use either a tray underneath or mounting bracket if you want it mounted. This can be easily done with some 3M tape or using a small tray
4	This is the 5th sleep mask that I have tried and it is the best at staying on for side / stomach sleepers. It still moves and will come off through the night sometimes but will usually make it to the morning. As far as the actual product, it is very soft. The velcro strap is wide enough that the mask keeps its shape and it is soft enough that makes it very comfortable on your head. I will add that it does not grab hair either, well at least mine not sure with someone that has long hair. The concave covering over the eyes is great. If you are on your back, you don't feel anything touching your eye. For the side sleeper, it is very flexible and soft that it is also comfortable when you got your face buried in the pillow. I didn't buy this for blackout feature of light but it does work pretty good. I did take a nap in the middle of the day last week and no light came through. The nose cut out helps with this compared to other masks. I purchased this to protect my right eye. I developed a lazy eye lid that opens on it's own when I sleep and being a side / stomach sleeper, this causes the sheets to scratch my eye and then for days I look like I have pink eye and it is scratchy and irritated. This mask has eliminated that problem and since I have been wearing it, my eye has been in great shape. I didn't give this review 4 stars because it still isn't "perfect" for side / stomach sleepers and honestly I don't think I will ever find one, but this one is the best I have tried so far.
4	Like these a lot, great style. Took off a star because the frames hinges got loose really fast.
4	This pump works well for water changes, but if you're trying to clean the gravel, it'll really only work for a larger tank. So much water gets sucked up but it does not have the suction power to pick up much of the muck! I have a 10 gallon tank, and was able to remove three gallons of water from my tank in roughly 10 minutes, including the time it took to put the pump together. It's easy to use and good quality, easy to clean, but would be more ideal for a larger tank!
4	Really sturdy well constructed suitcase. What I liked least about the suitcase is that it was not the one shown in the photo, the black with the orange trim and wanted it to match the same orange and black suitcase but in the larger 25" version I had purchased at the same time.
4	This product didn't work out for me, too ashy-grey due to my reddish undertones but all in all easy to apply and a brand I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.
4	I like this chair a lot! I've got bulging discs in my neck and this chair allows me the opportunity to decompress my spine and neck and take the pressure off of the neck. The material is good, the stitching is good too.
4	It was delivered on time and reached my expectations!!!
4	I have been using the hard side holder for a few months but it became too cumbersome for the number of cards I have to carry. This one is easier and has more room for cash. And I haven't spilled cards all over the store floor since I got it.
4	Super cute. Waist band is a bit funky but otherwise, my daughter loves it
4	I bought two pairs of these. One as a gift the other for myself. The receiver of the gifted pair has used lock laces before so they liked. I had a more of an adjustment period of trying to figure out tight or lose to make them on my shoes and still be comfortable.
4	I bought this just for me to have an electronic copy. I had given out paper version of this as gifts. It's a great book. It's a great read. It's a 40 day devotional journey...motivational and reflective...
4	It cuts cardboard with ease. I bought it for my child that likes to create stuff with cardboard. He likes it. Even though it looks extremely big on his hands. He uses both hands to use it. But he is able to cut with ease.
4	Product works and smells as it should. If I wanted a different scent I could have picked up for significantly cheaper at the store but I couldn't find this anywhere. The first package came completely broken but Amazon sent a replacement promptly.
4	I recently started to learn macrame and when I saw this cradle I knew I had to have it! It is gorgeous and such a unique design. The light pillow type cushion that goes inside the cradle is a bit too flimsy, so I ordered a thicker one from England to add more support. For a newborn, this may be better, but as the baby grows more to 8-10 pounds, it looks like it will be necessary to put a wooden base in the bottom as well!
4	I love to this turner which I looked for..rust free..and safety on cooking! Only small disappointing is a little heavier than I think.
4	Sealable bag kept the product fresh. Tasted great when prepared.
4	I like the built in runners for hanging files but the drawers do not fully extend. This makes it so you are unable to fill the drawer to capacity and still access your files.
4	Very Cute!! I got this to send to my mom for Mother's day. it has a slip in the side blank card to write your message on, if you dont want to write by the 'vase'. My only wish - that it was a little bigger :) but it is really cute.
4	One sensor was bad out of the box. That's the reason I've been unable to get the tpms system programmed.
4	I liked that it felt well made.easy to use.
4	Very pretty top. Material was nice and fit was good.
4	I bought for my wife and she said its a nice color and material
4	Great hold strength, fantastic scent and at a great price! Don Juan, is quickly becoming my go to for all my pomade needs.
4	This bag works great for me! I've been looking for awhile for this style of bag! I can put my sweaty gym clothes in the bag close it and done! I can put back in my gym bag without having to worry about my clothes stinking up my bag! It seals the wetness and odors! This bags holds socks,underwear,shorts, and shirt with no problem! That's plenty for me you may need a bigger size if you want to pack your shoes and workout pants or sweatshirts! Its real easy to clean as well!
4	The only complaint I have is that it doesn’t have the ability to operate the switch twice and go from motion sensor to on and then back to motion sensor again. Other than that, I’m very happy. Installed it on my second story back deck and it lights up my 1/4 acre yard when turned on.
4	Love the smell. Unfortunately the smell disapates very quickly.
4	The first disc was missing in Season One.
4	Beautiful color and dress design. Love the fit and the length for hubby! A little on the thin side though.
4	Since I wear a 101/2 and there are no half sizes after size 10 I had been advised to go for the smaller size because the slippers stretch out. I’m still hoping that happens since my toes hit the end of the toe. They are well-made and warm.
4	I'm surprised how long the battery last very well
4	Not hard to install but the covering material is very slick and you need to put a rug or other non-slip surface on top of it if you don't want you pet slipping around while seated on it.
4	Just had this projector screen put in my new movie room and I loooove it. I thought it was too big at first but with some adjustments it looks and works great.
4	Only giving four stars because the handle to push the stroller is a bit low. I’m 5’4 and it’s kinda low for me. It’s nice and big though and both my 17lb babies (dogs) fit it in very comfortable.
4	Is not very sturdy and does not hold much weight.
4	I finished this story in a couple of days due to a cold and the meds knocking me out. It has a HEA but it was an abrupt ending. They all went from being so miserable with her head shoved up her butt to Hugs and Kisses in public. It left me wanting at the end. Like Jodi didn't know what to do with it. It seemed like she missed somethings. I guess a more involved and deeper storyline. I don't know. But I will be giving her another go by reading another of her stories hopefully it's better and will leave me with a more lasting satisfaction.
4	My dog seems to like this one. It's grain free, and not as expensive as some other brands.
4	It is cute, and will be a natural and reuseable serving tray.
4	It is what it is, it’s a cheap couch. Works fine- not the best quality for anyone who isn’t petite- it busted when my dad sat on it- he’s not a very large guy.
4	I use this in my closet to hold accessories. The main frame of the unit is solid and easy to move where you need it, but I wouldn't put heavier items in the bins, as they are not made of the strongest material. The unit works well for my purpose and the price is great.
4	Reasonable at my location
4	Wouldn't recommend for a diabetic. My husband has thin legs and ankles and these socks were still too tight.
4	The assortment was nice but the box was smaller than I expected for the price. Everything looks good, but I probably won't eat the spicy one. I bought it for a diabetic so the sugared ones will be eaten a little at a time. Very pretty package.
4	I learned new ways to pray different prayers aimed to address specific areas of my life, relationships, and others. Will use this book for reference.
4	This was given as a gift
4	Works good reasonable price. Battery back up and wall plug in
4	Its heavy duty. A little pricey.
4	I thought it would be a little stronger than what it is but it's alright, for the price it's really good. I used it in the automotive field and it serves its purpose
4	it cover the land that i have and it smells good
4	The Kids (ages 3 and 5) really liked it. I got a little shorted though because it was missing the first sticker sheet that goes with the first two pages in the book. It keeps them occupied for about 20 minutes adding the stickers and then they have fun coloring the page after.
4	price was great. Fast delivery!
4	Expected the bottom hem to hug my hips. It does not. The boxy fit at the bust does straight down to hem. Large fits nicely at bust. Good quality, nice weight. Good details. Nice muted blue color.
4	After 2 weeks using them driving a forklift in a warehouse freezer, I decided to buy a second pair because they do a great job keeping my hands warm at work. They are great for keeping the wind out when im traveling on my forklift, though they dont have good grip for handling boxes otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.
4	Really cool product, I have twin toddlers (2 years) it's big enough for both of them to play absolute mess free and nicely made. Well worth the price
4	Great boat for the price. If you are looking to try out a boat, I'd give this one a try. It does favor one side a lot, but you can trim it to make up for it. I didn't find it to be that fast on windy days on a lake, but may be it's faster on a calmer day.
4	Feels pretty ergonomic, but plastic seem a bit cheap
4	The socks themselves are fine. I had asked if they would fit a 4 year old toddler and was told yes. They wii not fit a toddler.
4	Didn't shed as much as I thought it would, but it did leave faint blue marks around my neck. Overall happy with the purchase.
4	Assembly was easy with clear instructions. The only reason for a 4 rating is because of minor cosmetic issues. As you can see in the picture, there's was a scratch on the top part. There are 4 small metal L's that hold the key board tray: two of them were bent but I easily bent them back to their original shape. Also, on the underneath part of the desktop, there was a split/crack in one of the corners from the stud they placed where the screw would go. Other than those issues it seems like a nice desk for the price. The keyboard tray pulls out about 6 inches.
4	Very easy to operate. It does throw off quite a bit of heat but I didn’t mind that
4	Plain scent but it works perfectly
4	Good product... Just what you expect in an 18 hour bra.
4	The stockings fit but they kept rolling down. The sticky part didn’t work well at all. Future buyers may want to purchase garter straps.
4	This is a cheap solution to missing or damaged bite valves on water bladders. Yes, they can leak a little bit. Not really any more than standard bite valves. I've gotten to the point that I buy the cheap bladders and sometimes the bite valves fall off or fail. Generally, the bladders are just as good as the full price ones, sometimes better.
4	Excellent product for the price
4	Only thing with the cord, is they don’t stay put in the phone . They come out Easily. the leds light are great to watch n the length is great.
4	Eyes don't glow very well. Product came in good condition.
4	So far it seems to be working okay. Sprayed the screen on our patio door and bugs are staying away. I sprayed the inside of the house around kitchen moldings and wowza the smell is sooooo strong! I ended up stopping with just the kitchen because the smell spread throughout our house so much I didn't know how we would sleep at night.
4	i just received it. i will comment in detail when i start using it in a clinical setting
4	Arrived in good time but arrived with a broken clip. It looks like the end was sowed off before being threaded through second eye on the clip. The clip was broken on one side and threaded through. When you pull it tight it will come out of place and slip loosely on your body. I taped it in place due to this being the only thing wrong. A time goes this will get replaced with something more sturdy. The rest is well made and works as advertised.
4	For the money this is the best grow tent on market
4	The nice and I give as a gift my husband love them and my son too
4	They serve their purpose
4	Really REALLY like everything about these glasses, except the polarized lens. They're very nice, very comfortable, and the carbon fiber really is flexible and durable. I just need to wear these AND be able to see the screen of a tablet at work. The polarization makes it difficult to view a phone/tablet screen.
4	as shown,very pretty
4	Makes interior detailing very easy. The big brush broke once but seller sent us a new pack. I highly recommend this.
4	bought to replace the battery in my mom's phone that was draining too quickly. The replacement battery seems to drain just as fast, thinking it is the phone and not the battery. Battery works, charges without issues.
4	Easy to use and not drying to the skin.
4	Product was delivered leaking
4	Fits on my oral-B well and have not had any problems with it thus far. Only complaint would be that I wish the heads were a little smaller like on a philips toothbrush head. However, I feel this cleans my teeth much more efficient then just the regular round heads. Will most likely order again once I run out.
4	They fit perfect but as other people said they did start to tear apart at the heal fairly quickly. I only wore them for a few days on a cruise before they started tearing. Very comfortable though!
4	Good pool kinda hell to take apart and the filter needs to be better and stronger but overall good value for the money!
4	Interesting, historically accurate thriller. Novel has great pace an clever character development. I believe it gives a good feel for the turmoil in the Middle East today.
4	Leaks coffee from around the bulb seal.
4	This shirt is super cute!!!! I really didn’t know what was going to happen when I ordered this but i love it. The back is open which is pretty. The only reason i took a star away is because when I didn’t wear a bra you could see through the chest area. I got this in a color yellow so i might reorder in a darker color. If you’re not planning on wearing a bra with this like i was, order a darker color
4	Nice cabinet for the price.... was very easy to put together by myself. Package came a little beat up but the product inside was fine.
4	Wish the product came in a light brown or medium blonde
4	Good funny u seen 1 and 2 duh watch the 3rd
4	I had to throw away about 10 of them because they ripped so easily but this is a good size for something small and it is black.
4	This book is all around made and I collect there will be more books made as times goes on. Indeed, even it will demonstrate to you how accommodating Alexa can be a major part of your life or who does it work or how to take fullest potential from this gadget. This book offered a little measure of information on my item, yet left me still oblivious in the matter of how to use it. the data in this book will let you know all that you have to think about Alexa's abilities.
4	This scanner works pretty good so far...I was skeptical because of the price...I do a lot of driving for work, and I go over the speed limit when I'm running late... 😏... it's alerted me to officers I didn't see a couple times already. My only problem is not knowing what the different alerts mean (but I'm sure I can look it up) and I can't really understand the female voice that says stuff every once in a while...
4	This is the third monk fruit product I've tried. It tastes better and dissolves more quickly than the other two. I use it in my morning coffee every day. Minus 1 star for price.
4	Very good quality, works good, just wish the water came out stronger
4	Super cute I do wish they each had a little bag or something to gift to individual teachers
4	I ordered wrong part
4	I got the 2mm earrings and they're perfect for everyday wear - although the 1mm would have been fine too. I gave 4/5 stars because they make my ears ITCH and HURT when it says it's sterling silver and not supposed to.
4	I love the looks of these lamps, they are a gorgeous teal blue crackled glass. I took a star off because our “like new” warehouse deal lamps came in a battered box and dented lamp shades. They are on the backside so we decided to keep the lamps instead of dealing with the hassle of sending them back and waiting the 1-4 weeks for new ones to be sent.
4	Timely and reasonably priced. No serious quality issues.
4	These are not for long term, I have had to change out my jewlery for surgery. First night they came out. On some the backs were rough and on my lip piercing it cut into my mouth. These are more for single day use or you will be consistently trying to find the plug or replacing with if you have any extra.
4	First of all it smells great! That’s my 4 stars. It’s smaller than what I thought but that’s on me for not reading dimensions well. There is no timer, otherwise would’ve been a five star. Otherwise would’ve been five stars for sure
4	I need them and it's conveniently available to me. The doctor has a limit of three per day, but I need to test more often. Sometimes you have to be your own physician.
4	I like a very good working.
4	Easy to install and very happy with the battery life
4	Good size came quickly easy to use
4	Great story, just too short. I wish it was a full novel. The characters seem extremely intriguing. Hopefully the author will revisit this story .
4	I haven't used it yet, just unboxed it, but it seems well made. The pad is manufactured by Dupont, again a good sign. Although I did wonder if it was stained in some way or if that's just the color scheme? see pic...
4	A little shorter than expected.
4	I like that the ends are looped with a nice rubber coated sleeve.
4	I like it for the gym
4	Works almost as good as my doctor prescribed meds, without all the side effects.
4	A bit over the top but I liked it.
4	Cute size, quite durable and they came with labels.
4	The slim 3.5 male connector is perfect for connecting to my iPad/phone with a hard case and plugging it to a mixer for live shows. I noticed the sleeve was not tight and started to unscrew itself from the tip and caused scratches to the cable. Screwing it back on was no problem by hand. Great sound quality cable to have in my toolbox!
4	My phone is cracked after using this it doesn't protect your phone that much
4	Direct fit. No issues. Got the dryer back to drying in 30 minutes
4	Not the best, not the worst. There were a few scents that I thought smelled a little different than usual, compared to other brands that I have used recently. I will probably try a different brand the next time I need more oils, I just don't feel 100% sold on these.
4	They seem to be just what I needed.
4	Great story, but feels a little drawn out. The narrative is probably worth 3 stars, but the depth of the research done elevates it to 4
4	what my husband wanted. very happy
4	They work great the only downside is they are like super long which I’m not a huge fan of but it gets the job done
4	Is does not have an actual screen protector built in like i thought it would so that’s disappointing, i had to add one underneath, the case was a bit stiff and hard to put on but overall its good im not mad at it. This was a gift for my sister and she really likes it
4	make sure you keep them in a plastic bag. the poor cap design leaks every where if the bottle tips even a little.
4	It's a pen flashlight exactly as described just a tad bit too long in my opinion but other than that useful little thing to carry around in your pocket or car very bright. No adjusting anything. Has little clip four pockets and whatnot. I personally leave it next to my bed and use it at night when I get up and it's dark in the house as my personal little walk around light.
4	Good heavy material for winter..hangs well
4	I'm using my organizer in my classroom for my yearbook students. It holds their press passes and all the documents they need for their class.
4	It was cute but not as bright as I thought it would be.
4	I use this religiously. It does wonders for me with inflammation. I work offshore in the Gulf of Mexico as a mechanic and a machinist. My job is very physical. This helps.
4	Socks are soft, comfortable and fit very well.
4	This is a good product. Good coverage and very easy to install. Only problem i have seen is the touch sensitivity has decreased greatly. Some times It takes a couple of times to get something’s to react.
4	The cats love it. They are able to be satisfied with this and never seem to be hungry. They were always wanting more food with the other brands. We use this per our Vet's recommendation. We have an older cat with urinary tract problems so all cats must have the same diet.
4	Enjoyed the quick read. Although I was able to predict the next move in most cases. Either I am getting good enough to write them or the book is a very predictable read.
4	The cover isn't water-resistant so the foam insert can end up soiled pretty easily. The foam also is pretty difficult to wash due to the size and it takes a fair amount of time to air dry, I've had to hand wash it a few times already and each time was frustrating... I suggest getting a waterproof cover if you get this for a puppy. Otherwise, put the foam inside a trash bag and tape the opening close to keep moisture from reaching the foam. So far it's helped decrease the amount I've had to wash the foam pad. And the cover still fits over the trash bag covered foam pad without issue. It's affordable, quality seems good on both the foam pad and the outer cover. The only issue seems to be that it's not water-resistant.
4	Cutting quilt fabric
4	I wish it were a bit larger.
4	Works great - the instructions are a little confusing as it tells you to make sure the flame lock switch is in the off position, but it can only be moved once the torch is lit. I am guessing they have had many problems with it, because I got 2 emails from the supplier making sure I was aware of this (of course AFTER I broke mine trying to move it). It still works fine without the switch...I don't know that I will ever have a need for a flame lock switch, so not returning it. The instructions could probably be a little more clear.
4	This product has worked the best after purchasing several more expensive products. I do find it time consuming to clean the hair from the glove but still satisfied. My dog sheds sooooo much, this glove has been helpful but he still sheds regardless of frequency of use.
4	Love these!!!! So comfortable and keep me nice and warm!!!!
4	Love the game. Come join the fun!
4	I enjoy this coffee as the flavor is not too light or too strong. I use half the sugar but still enjoy cream in my coffee.
4	useful but too expensive
4	Hat was damaged before shipping. The damage affected the quality. Company made the situation right and I would buy from them in the future. Very appropriated!!
4	Works great, the only thing I don't like about it is that is shines bright blue when charging. First night I had it in my bedroom at night to charge, the whole room lit up. Kind of hard to sleep with a big, bright, blue room. Other than that, it works great for charging!
4	Way bigger than I thought they would be, but they work very well! Super soft and plush, I will definitely buy again.
4	Having too many micro USB cables and only 2 lightning cables, I needed an adapter that would allow me to use those cables and not have to remember to always carry one of the 2 that work with Apple products. This way I can also have a spare cable available at work, since my iPhone always seems to run out of battery in the afternoon, and have others in more locations so that I don't have to go looking for the right cable to charge things when I need to.
4	Came on time. One of the bottle was broken from the shipping. But for the price and the amount I dont mind. I would have given it a 5 star if none were broken
4	Easy to hold and use. Magnification is not bad as stated. It comes with nice bag for storage. My 3 yr old loves to use it.
4	Super comfy! A little small.
4	Very good for my 2 cats, keeps the smell away
4	I buy this tea for my father-in-law who is more of a coffee drinker and isn't fussy about tea. I personally find it fairly harsh and not a soothing beverage. Organic teas that cost more tend to have a better flavor and go down better, even black. Still for the price, it's not bad.
4	I purposely avoided ordering the narrow version but these feel narrow. I do like the soft footbed though. Can't beat birks!
4	I give this book almost 4 hearts So this is the story of Sarah a beautiful young woman that is abducted by aliens. That said she shows no fear and finds her self having some serious bed time with her captor. However not long after she arrives the ship she is on is under attack and she is taken by yet a different group of E.T.’s! So she is now with the other alien species this fella is named Gar and turns out the first group were bad news, think influence you to do what they want. Before she knows it sexy Gar has her in the throws of passion, hubba hubba. Seriously it’s a little crazy the aliens definitely have a thing for this hot little human. However things are never quite that easy.... soon enough Sarah finds herself captured by yet another group of aliens where she meets a surprising individual but up she is abducted by the bad guys again oh no will Gar be able to save her?? A cute fast sexy ET read give it a try it’s certainly hot enough. ** reviewer for romance authors that rock
4	Nice colors and sturdy
4	Does the job. I llike it. I prefer it to the round style much more.
4	It’s a little unstable when at it’s full height, but since that’s too tall for me anyway the desk if great!!! The extra shelf works perfectly for my double monitors! Shipping had a small chip but it doesn’t face my side so I let it go.
4	I gave the Boys Camouflage LED Sport Watch as a Christmas gift. It was well-received.
4	Handy item to better hold your cell phone. My case has some a slight sand-papered surface, so the strap device has lost its adhesion a time or two, but always sticks back on. I have a magnetized cell phone holder in my car so I placed the strap off center to the back of my phone so it would not interfere with the magnet.
4	This book is totally intriguing
4	Great fit, nice material and easy to install. Rubbed leather conditioner on band about putting it on, for easy break in, worked great.
4	This fan is very powerful, it clips wherever you need it. Would have given it 5 stars, except it was missing some screws. Otherwise it has exceeded my expectations. I love this fan.
4	I just received it and it seems to be working fine I just haven't had that really hot and humid day yet to really see if it keeps my apartment cool...
4	Most delicious and fresh tasting
4	Arrive on time very pretty. It is a Christmas present. So I don't know about the cold or hot statics yet.
4	Very cute but gave it a 4 because of the spacing of the hooks. I use this for 3 leashes and cant really but the leash on the hook have to loop the collar. Would be better used probably for coats or keys.
4	I’m short and this doesn’t cover my entire belly including the lower pouch. Other wise it’s pretty good for the price
4	Great set for running cables.
4	Usually wear a small but since the suit runs small I went with a medium, I’m 5’2, 135 lbs, 34 b bra, and wear a size 4-6 bottoms.
4	Pretty tough to rate sturdiness and durability after two days but I can say it survived removal from the packaging materials. I bought these because my phone was failing to charge on the old cords...now it charges plugged in one way but not the other....phone or cord? Your call.
4	These are very lightweight plastic. I was expecting something a little more sturdy. It did not hold a standard plastic water bottle as it fell out during a ride. Otherwise it is a good price for what you get.
4	Fun read by an author that usually writes heavier stuff. There were a few inconsistencies pertaining to the game of football, but overall it was pretty good!
4	This thing pumps the water so well that I haven’t figured out how to keep water in the bird bath for more than an hour ay a time!! Any suggestions??
4	Holds all my necessary information and is pretty easy to read. Band is a little bulky but it's not a deal-breaker. I like the silicone band; no issues with getting wet or dirty.
4	Needs a clip to hold the phone in place.
4	I enjoyed the books. The story was for the most part interesting. Loved how time travel was incorporated into the story, and how it showed opposites attract.
4	Best price I can find for a good bar of soap. Works well, smells good and not over scented which would bother my nose.
4	Loved it . Very light weight and enough room to hold spare items in the main part plus a water bottle. Only downside is it could use two zippers on small outside pocket. Closing one zipper all the way round was inconvenient to stop small things from falling out
4	works well popping in the microwave with a silicone popper
4	Nice size, fresh product.
4	Great glue, but it always glues the cap to the bottle which is nearly impossible to open!
4	Great product, great price! didn’t give it 5 stars because they are kinda hard to blow up. Other than that, we love them!
4	It’s great for backpacking...good taste....however, the texture of watery eggs is something I had to get used to. But, you can’t beat the ease of preparation for the dehydrated meal and a hot breakfast of eggs & bacon on a cold morning.
4	A little hard to install.
5	Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.
5	These earbuds sound just like the Apple ones I bought my daughter, but for a fraction of the cost. These came with a nice little pouch and a charging cable too. I highly recommend them.
5	Just Awesome durability and its as exactly as the seller had described even better this is my first time buying this kind of Kit and I tell you what I am so proud of it I love it love it love it is so awesome I recommend the seller to anyone seller is an amazing seller and is true to their word thank you for sending such an awesome package From Irma McKnight
5	Exactly like the pictures. Be careful when pulling them off the sticky strip bc they are delicate and sometimes rip in half.
5	Great movie ! Loved it !
5	The light is very helpful for dark colored yarns.Very comfortable to use.
5	needed it so worth it
5	This is a great discus for the price.
5	The packaging was so cute And they sent a free gift. The cover is very soft and I recommend it
5	Too snug. Needed to get an 11 not 10
5	Great for closeups. I put my makeup on better.
5	This was a gift for my mom she loves them and would recommend these house shoes.
5	My favorite vitamins. Good product.
5	Good case so far that is very slim to the phone. I like that there is not a very bulky case around the phone to hide the beauty of the iPhone, but you can tell there is protection. I have not dropped the phone yet to test and hope not to lol. Aces so far.
5	Wonderful to sleep on. Was considering getting a new mattress and I'm not anymore. I have a memory foam top layer on my mattress that I felt wasn't supporting me by the morning. My new topper firms it up while remaining soft and comfortable. Also just moved to CA, and I don't think it's hotter to sleep on than my regular mattress at all. If anything it actually cools me down a bit.
5	Great product, easy to assemble and gold finish is superb!
5	So VERY HAPPY I purchased this flag!!! The quality, colors and design are OUTSTANDING! I gave to my Best Friend who likes to watch the Kentucky derby and other horse racing. She LOVED it and has it flying in the front of her home. It is so well made and sturdy material. I know she will have it for many years.
5	James Kipling writing style is awesome! This murder mystery book had me at the edge of my seat.
5	Love this playpen, it was very very easy to put together, just open and zip in the bottom. Bought this for my grandsons pet mini lop bunny and he has plenty of room to hop around and my grandson likes to get in it with the bunny too. I would recommend for any small animal.
5	Awesome. Easy to get in and out of. Well constructed with durable fabric.
5	very nice quality product
5	A great rug especially for the price - very soft on your feet
5	Looks JUST like an authentic LV cover! No one can tell. I get compliments all the time too! It's very well made! Very happy with it!
5	Came as expected. Packaged great. Nice and tight. That’s typical for ipower though. I have purchased many things Over the years from these guys and have never been disappointed. So far this is working great for my seedlings. 3 of these side by side approx 2 to 3 feet apart and I’ve got hundreds of seedlings thriving. Low power usage and low heat u can’t beat it for the price.
5	This is a GREAT belt! I love everything about it and am really enjoying wearing it everyday. Really excellent quality. A+++
5	I bough it for my baby ! Couse I really need a product like it ! And it works great! I set time and temperature! Real good ! My family very like too !
5	Pyramid as described, well done. The stone is black and beautiful, it surface is unpolished but very soft . At first touch it stained my fingers with a fine black dust but after a thoroughly wash the pyramid did not stained my hand anymore.
5	LOVE THESE!!! they fit so well and my ginormous 5 month old will be able to wear them for a bit longer!!!! seriously the best purchase
5	I use to get these at this cute little shop in Eureka Springs, AR but since moved away and SO SO badly wanted these candles. They burn even the fragrance smells the whole house 2000 sq ft. I am a Candle freak and these are BY FAR the best I have ever burned.
5	I like the vr built in headphones.You need to download 3D app or find 3D videos on You Tube to watch, but it's worth the money.I don't know how to express my word, it is amazing watching video. Well built.
5	The washcloths are very soft, I like the little handles they have, color variety is great as I and my children each use a different color.
5	A great stand for my iPhone. I use it at night and it is perfect for what I need it for. I use a Steelie in my truck so it is a perfect companion for it.
5	Nothing I dislike it has met my expectations!
5	Great for the price, can't beat it.
5	This top is adorable
5	The item arrived on time and in a good condition and it works great. Also I will continue to purchase from this company in the near future.
5	I got it today. I'll put it on the front porch and the back yard and the garbage can. It's very good. It's light, sensitive, convenient, very practical.
5	This bag has a good quality material, I’m surprised the size is a good size. Perfect for a weekend get away!
5	Great, effective herbal remedy for a sensitive urinary bladder.
5	Purchased 7 pair and they were a hit with the kids. All of them worked just fine.
5	i got one as a baby shower gift and fell in love with it i had to buy my sister in law one for her shower
5	The microscope is easy to use and I can connect it to my phone. It has a high definition and can be photographed clearly in the dark, it is very small and easy to carry.
5	I was skeptical of this safe because of some bad reviews. However this is one of my favorite purchases. Everything works perfectly for several months thus far. The video of the guy easily breaking into the safe is a bit misleading; however there is an access "key slot" under the Stanley plate. If you're that worried about someone breaking in I suggest a bigger safe and a change of location haha. I added two motion sensor lights to the inside which really makes a huge difference. The door had a little play in it when closed, a thin foam tape fixed that. I also read a review about finger print issues; if you dont reset the safe before entering prints then any print will work, says so in the manual. Do a proper setup and it works great. If your worried about speed of access I suggest logging your middle finger as well, you can then hit the key and read your print in one motion thia is also much more comfortable. Another thing is log your finger in several positions for easy access. Somehow I was able to disable the open door alarm which I was happy about. I intend to mount this inside a large gun safe so the fact that it is not fireproof is less of an issue to me otherwise that would be the only downside. Highly recommend this safe.
5	Do not like the roll on's at all but it's okay
5	I use this lockbox for third party work. It is easy to use and sturdy. Very convenient and secured way to store keys for someone else to access my property.
5	I enjoyed this product because its cooling and feels great when you put it on and take it off. Highly recommended.
5	Fits as expected. No complaints. 😊
5	Perfect size for carrying two dolls and some of their accessories. The bottom of the tote has a zippered compartment perfect for outfits and small pieces. The tote is well made. It was purchased for use with the 14" Wellie Wisher dolls from American Girls.
5	Exactly what I expected. Great product!
5	Smaller than I thought but still really nice
5	Product looks amaizing and excited to add this to my daily supplement intake.
5	This is the best stuff ever for dry skin! I love it! Great price too!
5	The Spigen Thin Fit is in my rotation on every phone I buy.
5	Very happy with this item
5	These are working out great for my vehicle. Big improvment.
5	Since I was a beginner flying drones, I’ve had several questions. Holy stone has been great answering my question in a timely manner. Flying the drone with my grandson has been a great experience. If you are interested in a drone, I would recommend Holy Stone. They have been a pleasure to work with.
5	Worth every dollar spent, I use this in my garden and in my kitchen. It’s very durable and folds up small enough for easy storage. I’m short so the extra height definitely helps!
5	This wand and washer ends were the perfect replacement on our Honda power washer.
5	This is a great read in the life of a legend
5	My rats seem to really enjoy these . I will purchase them again.
5	I love this mirror! It’s both battery and plug in operated. I love that it’s affordable and light weight
5	Why is such good flavoring hard to find! Well no more! Excellent!! Right up there next to Watkins which seems overly expensive anymore and i love the bigger bottle and the flavor is top notch!’ Love how affordable 1 bottle is! My new go to brand!!
5	Heats well and it is lightweight.
5	I bought this for my daughter who just became a teen and all of a sudden has broken out. I attribute it to her not cleaning her face as well as she should and of course hormones! She was tickled when I gave it to her. She loves that it fits into the palm of her hand easily so she has not problem gripping it. She has been using it since we got it and loves it. I am pleased knowing that she is getting her skin squeaky clean.
5	light, comfy , and very good sound!
5	Cheap, but works WELL!
5	I just finished reading the last book, and I am sad it is the end of the series. I truly enjoyed playing sleuth alongside Margot Durand, and oftentimes I would be able to solve the murder, only to be trumped by a fresh piece of evidence. I will miss North Bank!
5	It is fantastic! I bought similar lights from other websites, and they have poor quality. Although this one is more expensive than others, I think it is worthy. It is really a good decoration for dorm! I will probably buy one more to give my mother as a gift!
5	Priced very well. I trust NOW products.
5	Very good algae remover for the price
5	Absolutely one of the best hoods you can get!!! I was completely blown away by the clarity and field of view provided by this hood! I've tried others and this one is unrivaled. Been using it two months now and that automatic feature is a lifesaver! If you have the money definitely get this hood, you won't be disappointed!
5	Love these for dressy to casual they look stunning!
5	My son loves this. Just wish there was a low volume option on it
5	Perfect gift for college student.
5	This product offers a burning sensation because it's cooling down the inflammation in your eyes. If you can't handle it buy something that probably won't work as well. Not me. This is it.
5	My husband does the outdoor grilling and he loves it.
5	Nice glasses. Easy to tell who’s drink is who’s.
5	The quality of the product is good. It's fits nicely and easy to apply. This is by far the best experience that I had when buying glass screen protector online. Will definitely purchase from this seller again.
5	I love this body wash. The lemon smell is so nice. Have been using it for several years.
5	Arrived on time and in one piece.
5	I bought this for my husband’s 60th birthday he put on on for his birthday party and again two days later. He loved it. It did well when it was washed.
5	I am happy I purchased this product. I love these straws. They even come with a tiny telescoping cleaning brush that fits inside each straw. These stay extended like they are supposed to and work great.This doesn't take up anymore room than a tube of lipgloss and would fit in your pocket too.
5	Although this pump is smaller it works great for the value. I used it on the farm to spray fence rolls and it can reach over 10 feet of stream. We are very please
5	Extreamly comfortable material, very soft and form fitting. Doesnt even feel like its there
5	This bag fits nicely under the seat or at your feet in the car. It has multiple pockets for easy access to your phone, water bottle, etc. The interior of the bag holds make-up, medical supplies, books, etc. It's deceivingly "large" due to it's configuration and pockets. I am not searching or fumbling for items, therefore, not annoying the person sitting next to me. Best of all it has a built-in strap at the back, so it slides right on top of another suitcase or carry-on.
5	This is so great on garden fresh veggies. Thank you for your quick service
5	Excellent- good support for injuries.
5	Just got my coins in today and they are awesome! Super shiny, good weight, and great quality! They came in a very nice case, I would highly recommend!
5	Great pair of boots. The fit is perfect, the inside is lined with a soft somewhat furry material that doesn't feel padded, which I really like. It quite literally hugs your feet but it's made in such a way that you can line it with socks for added warmth if you need to. It doesn't hurt that it's pretty, so all in all great purchase.
5	This cake decorating kit has everything I need for decorating my cake; all the tools were so useful for me. I bought this set for No regrets! I love the two large icing spatula are so straight and easy to hold and adjustable scraper was perfectly smooth out my cake. I also had a fun time while doing it! Right tool for the job! I highly recommend this set!
5	They fit like a glove. Easy to install.
5	This is one of the first books in a long time I did not want to finish. All three of the books are captivating. They are tied into each other but you get to know each character even better. Which you will love with these books. I got close to every person. It is like a TV series you don't want the season to end. But you can't wait for the next!
5	Just as expected, arrived timely
5	This seller is amazing. First i have to say that i love this baby monitor. It does all you want and need (great day and night camera with zoom, great audio with audio light indicator, long battery, good talk back sound, very resistant monitor and the parents monitor is small enought so it fit in a back pocket). I totally recommand thia maby monitor. You can also have more than one camera set up but i didnt try it. No need for me Almost a year after purchase, i had a small issue with my parental monitor. Would charge properly. I wouldnt say this was a defective issue of the monitor but more a usage issue (Probably bb that keep pulling the cord). I contacted them. Their costumer service is amazing and also the people working for them. Same day responses to multiple emails and they were very helpful and very fast. I totally recommand you to contac them if you have any issue.
5	Wonderful. Shipping from Amazon could be better.
5	I have tears in both rotator cuffs and have a lot of pain. I thought this was just another gimmick but am willing to try practically anything for some relief. It came in the mail super fast. I took it out of the package and my first thought was "What a pleasant smell". No plastic. Not overpowering. Just a waft of lavender. It is super soft and the feel is excellent. I tried it straight out of the box - no heating, no cooling. Oh. My. God. Just the warmth of the material, the scent & the weight were enough to give me some relief. I can't wait to try it heated up if it feels this good right now. I will definitely be ordering several more for family members for gifts!
5	My kids love this and it's easy for them to use.
5	I was looking for cable and luckily I found this from Amazon. I like how it comes with three in a pack and I can tell the material is durable and well made. Considering the price, that's a great buy!
5	In the summer I wear a darker shade of makeup. These wash cloths make it a breeze to get my makeup off the wash cloth!
5	I need something to hold my new prescription glasses - I wanted to protect my Coach glasses and this was perfect. Double protection and great to toss in beach bag
5	This is a superb devotional I am a connoisseur of devotionals and this is one of the best I’ve ever read Brian and Michelle did their due diligence and pointing us to Jesus and to referencing all of the places in the series that they could and the lessons learned I would recommend this to anyone it is beautiful inside and out ! Well done!
5	didn't expecte get such sharpe carving knife by this price, but it's ture!
5	All parts came in place works great
5	Had for a few weeks now. Working great, has enough capacity to last all night long.
5	Works great, good purchase to protect instruments
5	Bracelet arrived on time in beautiful packaging (no need to rewrap if you don't want to). The poem inside is beautiful. At first I thought bracelet was super tiny, but realized needed to be for an infant to wear, and it adjusts up for communion and to wedding nicely. It seems fragile and delicate, so maybe for special occasional wear only. All in all, a beautiful gift.
5	Just what I wanted. Arrived on time.
5	The material is wonderful and they washed up great. No need to iron them.
5	This frame was perfect for a poster we've been wanting to hang. Looks like real glass but of course light weight. Would repurchase. Very easy to hang.
5	Everything feels and works great. Confident it will last
5	Recently bought three sets of these laces in different colors. Have replaced all of the tie laces in my sneakers with these and am very happy. They were easy to use and have eliminated that feeling of your shoes tightening as your feet swell throughout the day. Plus they make putting your shoes on and off so much easier. Of course they frayed after cutting them, but that is no big deal as they ends are entrapped in the end closure. Good bargain that this price.
5	Traction pad was AMAZING can surf very well with it
5	Good quality easy to read Bible
5	GREAT PRODUCT. USE A LOT OF THESE.
5	I add this to my smoothies! It doesn’t negatively affect the texture or taste at all. I highly recommend it!
5	The cabinet exceeded my expectations. It looks a lot nicer and sturdier than I thought it would be. It came in a large, very heavy box. The UPS driver left it at our doorstep. The box was so heavy that I couldn’t drag it inside. So, I cut the box open and removed the individual parts and brought them inside. Although there was some slight damage to the exterior of the box, all the inside contents were intact without any scratches or blemishes. Nothing was missing. I and my 13 years old grand daughter were able to assemble it in about 3 hours. The instructions weren’t very good, but it wasn’t too hard for me to figure out how everything goes together, because I have previously assembled similar cabinets. The cabinet looks gorgeous in my kitchen. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a budget curio cabinet.
5	Nice look and protects
5	This is awesome!!!!! Easy to assemble and use!
5	I love this tama! This is my second On and I plan on getting the white when it is released. Worth the money.
5	These get the strangest reactions from our Puppy. At first, it terrified him. He’d walk way around it. Then, it became his favorite toy. The mechanism that makes it jump and talk is very sturdy. He’s never torn it up at all. Now they cute covering lasts a little longer than most plush toys, but eventually he is able to rip it up. He loves it so much, I’ve order a total of five, I think. This toy definitely keeps a puppy busy. English Mastiff
5	Love this product, I’ve noticed a huge difference in the clarity of my skin and tone after using 5 weeks and I haven’t gotten any new pimples since I started using it. It’s actually clearing my skin up and making it look softer at the same time. I’m also using the peptide serum right after it’s a great combo to use this cleanser and one of their serums right after morning and night. Eva’s is organic and a good product I’m glad I trusted it! Will def be offering more.
5	We have 7 of these cases and they work great! So far it’s been a great product!!
5	great product priced well and look great in the crib
5	The jewelry came just as pictured and just what I wanted. The size/colors are good too.
5	Love this tumbler. Doesn't sweat in the heat and ice takes a long time to melt. Definitely will buy again!
5	Morning preparations for work
5	Pretty and easy to wear
5	This helps me save money, nothing wrong with that, right?
5	Speechless!!! i cannot believe i haven't heard of this before, Best Quick portable charger with the convenience to charge my device on the go! the design is so slick and the device fits right in effortlessly , It charges up extremely fast and has a great feel to it as well, Must have for anyone with a Juul Device
5	I absolutely love this bag. I'm hoping to get another one on Prime Day!
5	Got a chance to use this at school and absolutely love it. I like the convenience of having it at home and not having to lug it around. For a teacher, it allows me to create notes and answer keys my students can see me working out. Would definitely recommend it!!
5	They advertise that you can roll the hat---and you can!
5	I use these vibrant yellow placemats for outdoor dinners. They are easy to clean. I love the yellow and with our round table they fit perfectly. They arrived wrapped in plastic and on time.
5	Works as described with my Fitbit.
5	There isn't much to say about SD cards. I have several digital cameras at the ready. I bought several used cameras. I'm an insurance adjuster and the cameras wear out or I drop them, sometimes off of a roof. I bought these cards for each of my backup cameras. Excellent value.
5	Quality, mostly easy to use boxes. A little over priced as you could shop locally but in the age of convenience Amazon does it best.
5	Just received the umbrella in a lightly damaged box but luckily the bag of parts didn’t fall out. Everything was in perfect condition and went together like a breeze. I am very happy with my purchase. I think I will anchor it to my deck with the awesome stand provided with holes to enable that to happen. I love the shade and quality of the umbrella.
5	So far I like the product. Took it to camp for two days. Used it on and off for 4 hours each night for two days. Still didn’t have to charge it.
5	I like the softness and length. It is also light but not too thin.
5	I liked the convenience of ordering this online and that it arrived promptly.
5	This really works last all day even on deep lines
5	This product has already impressed me. I bought this razor just a few days ago and have used it multiple times already! It does not pull or tug like other razors I have used. I am a big fan of the multiple attachments that come with this razor, the nose hair attachment is one I will use the most!
5	Love this radio...gets great reception and sound for a little radio at $12!
5	There is nothing wrong with it, great quality, plug in into your display port and will show HD quality images on your screen.
5	This unit works very well. It has all the bells and whistles, yet is compact and easy to understand. I can recommend it.
5	This book was excellent. It provides an in-depth discussion into creating mental models that align with the mental models of users. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the subject.
5	Bought as a gift for my daughter, seems like good quality.
5	flexible microwave lids in graduated sizes that fit inside one another through the central button handle - work well, excellent price. Anticipate they will be durable.
5	This pillow is the best thing I have ever purchased in my life! It’s so comfortable I feel like I’m sleeping in a cloud. It feels like I’m being cuddled on both sides. I’m 29 weeks pregnant at the moment and I have yet to be uncomfortable because of my belly. This pillow is a miracle. I can’t even lay on it without sleeping. I do, however have to buy more filling from the pillow losing a little firmness. Also in the picture it looks longer, but that doesn’t bother me. I will definitely be using this even after I’ve had my baby. I 100% recommend this buy. No regrets.
5	Very bright light bulb, material seems very solid. Price is a lot cheaper than branded ones
5	I have a hard time with off shoulder shirts sometimes, it seems like they want to ride up onto my shoulders. This shirt didn’t do that at all, it stayed exactly where it should be. I even danced in it. I love the sleeve accents and the lace, the shirt makes me feel very pretty. I adore it.
5	Solid vice. I ordered a cheap one that I instantly returned because it was like a toy. This Vice is big, solid and can handle whatever I throw at it.
5	Does what it is supposed to do, and has a standard micro USB plug, a plus!
5	I got this for my daughters room and it is very cute! It's low to the ground so I wouldn't recommend for big adult but perfect for girls room.
5	I love that these bottles were just the right size to travel with. This is my new daily cleaner. I'm not sure if it is possible but my glasses seem to stay cleaner longer. Easy to use and works very well. I think this is a great value for the money as well
5	The case arrived promptly as most Amazon prime orders do. It holds the new Nintendo 3DS XL and games perfectly. It is a good sturdy case, yet still very compact and portable.
5	This was one of the best purchases I've ever made. Turned a blank wall in my bedroom, into a huge entertainment screen for a very reasonable price. The only complaint I would have with it is that it doesn't produce great sound quality, to compare with how nice the picture is. So I would suggest getting a real speaker setup to go with this awesome purchase. Football sunday will never be better.
5	Was a bit skeptical at first but really such a good quality and great product. Would purchase again in he future!
5	omg is what you will say when you see this ,it very filling.I didn't think i could take this but with lube it went in,had to start slowly and enter only a inch at a time but after a few min wow.Would highly recommend. for beginners though.
5	love it! Will continue to order
5	Classics! Must-reads. So much depth for a "children's book," adults could read it a dozen times over and never cease to notice something new.
5	Very pleased with the decorations and there quality
5	We use this product regularly
5	Very thick coated metal, easy assembly. Will definitely buy again if needed.
5	Great product works great and produces a lot of ice
5	This water bottle is exactly what I had been searching for. It’s lightweight, and it’s easy for me to take everywhere. It does not leak at all. I absolutely love this bottle!
5	This keto book is exceptional and i think best book ever and i really recomanded it
5	Check the amazon.de site. It is MUCH cheaper there.
5	I ordered this shoulder strap to replace a missing strap on a bag. It works well, is very sturdy and seems to be of good quality. I am using it regularly, and it works great
5	Great small lightweight rotary tool. It is not going to be as powerful as a big one, but this thing is very handy and compact. The charging is convenient. You can use a USB phone charger or computer. It has standard connectors.
5	This product are very good, just one thing.. in the photo looks bigger. I thought will be bigger, I know you wrote the size. I liked !!!!
5	I have ordered toner for both my laser jet printer and my ink jet printer and am very satisfied with the quality of the product, the unbeatable price and the quick delivery! Thank you
5	This is a great, inexpensive wireless charging pad. It's the first one I've owned so I can't compare it to anything else, but it charges my Pixel 3 just fine. My only gripe is that the phone needs to be completely centered on the pad in order for it to charge. Other than that, it's been great.
5	The book was well made, love that we have hints and answers if needed. Size of print is big and easy to read, the best part is there is room to write my answers within the book. I am enjoying the puzzles - it will definitely take me a while to complete though. When I am ready for a new book I will look to Patel Puzzle Books for that purchase.
5	Love the movie and the actors. Good take on King Author story.
5	May cost a few more dollars but very well made. Quality product.....I am not disappointed!
5	One of my favorite snacks, excellent way to control portions! At a great price too!
5	Well written and great illustrations!
5	Love that it streamlines 2 of our watches and I like that they aren’t on the table.
5	These were all Christmas gifts everyone loved their gifts
5	I still can't believe I dropped this much money on a duvet cover, it was more than the new down comforter we also bought! But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the "dust" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty. Sometimes it's nice to just splurge.
5	I use this on all my devices to clean, clear, find, and manage all files and downloads
5	Good quality, and they really come in handy!
5	The Ketogenic Kitchen is a good book for sure. Those tips made my day! Great recipes, now I can cook far better.
5	My grandson absolutely loves them!
5	Easy to install with a supporting frame, scratches free. Screen is only visible when looking perpendicular to it. This is really good when you want to keep your stuff from being seen by others
5	I am reading this book for a second time, such a good read.
5	It is difficult to find patchouli that is not too strong. These sachets are perfect. Thank you.
5	SO cute! and such a great price! I was in need of a new black leather bag for work and this has fit all the criteria for me! It holds a lot, is super comfy on my shoulder and I love that there is even an inside pocket! The perfect spot for me to throw my keys so they don't get lost in the other things inside the bag. Highly recommend if you don't want to break the bank for a simple black leather tote.
5	I slouch at work sitting at a desk all day. Was trying to find a good solution to help alleviate the slouching and back pain. This posture corrector has definitely helped! I am sitting straighter and the pain has lessened.This posture corrector has given me strong support for my back, without restricting my movements.
5	Good story and it flowed very well. I would like to read more so I have ordered more. Look forward to the hole series.
5	WHen I first received this product, I was very disappointed. It simply would not open for any of my cats. We even had them chipped for the express purpose of using this feeder! After a week, we finally brought the cat back in to check the location of their chips, and lo and behold, the cat who needed to use the feeder was missing its chip entirely!! I did not know they could fall out, but apparently ours did and that's why the feeder wasn't working. The vet replaced the chip for free and now the feeder works perfectly. It took about a week to train the cat to use it, but she has no issues with it and the other cat is constantly disappointed that the lid is closed. One note, though. It says that you can program how long the lid stays open after the cat leaves. In fact, there is just a 3 position switch. This is good enough for us, but it doesn't work the way I thought it would after reading the literature.
5	Love it can be used for any special occasion or just want to feel sexy
5	Great colors for a set!
5	This product is really great!!!
5	I have had many Bluetooth's and this one is the best so far. The sound barrier has been the most important part. When I have both ear buds in I cant hear any outside voices or anybody close to me in distance. It's important to me. My boyfriend is in Texas and when we video chat I need to hear him and only him and these allow me to do just that. Thank you wireless earbuds.
5	Great Product. The dual sided vibrations are perfect. Its great because its waterproof and easy to clean. And my wife loves the color
5	Needed these for sometime. I had odds and ends before but would generally use the wrong size and would mess up the screw head and spend twice amount of time fixing my mishap.
5	Makes my tower blue tooth- I thought it was useless after the iPhone changes to the input no longer mate.
5	No problems like them
5	Love this shower curtain was everything I was hoping for !!!!! Great quality and awesome price
5	Yay, I don’t have to vacuum under the bed manually with a hose anymore. This is nice to have as a busy parent.
5	Oh my gosh! I couldn't believe it! It works great! I have tried other products claiming it would remove tear stains, but nothing I've tried compares to this! I love it!
5	Works good, stands up to my wife's weight when she is using it. Easy install, just get a diamond tip if you are installing in tile and I used a heavier gauge drywall plug. Ones that came with it are probably fine, just chose not to use them. Good product
5	I tried this product as kind of a "why not?". I've had digestive issues for several years, and frequently get upset stomach and indigestion. These pills have really helped mitigate my digestive discomfort and I feel noticeably better after meals when I take them. I'm going to start having my husband take them as well.
5	This is a great book. I have read this bokk very well. There is no wrong and written with good contents
5	The best earl grey I've ever had - its the only one i'll drink now !!
5	Over all a good player. There are two ways to turn the thing on and off - a switch a the bottom will turn power completely off and a sleep mode which remembers your last settings. The only negative is the power out put is low so you have to raise the volume higher than most players. Doing so drains the batteries so that it realistically last about 20 hours.
5	Have brought these bowls twice love then great fro salads and meal prep
5	I bought one like this for my stepdaughter. She liked it so much as it helped her with her back pain I decided to get one for myself. I am very impressed with this. I am walking tall and not slouching. My back feels good. Thank you for such a great product.
5	Perfect size for a queen sleeper sofa with arm rests. Ordered another one as soon as the first one came. Dark Grey matched sofa perfectly.
5	The fabric material of this shirt is soft and flowy and the color doesnt fade when washed but the size does run small and its snug from the chest area so i would suggest ordering 1 size larger than what you usually wear. I personally really liked the ribbon tie that came with it... You can style it in different ways as you can see in the pictures attached.
5	This is well designed. I can exercise with no trouble while wearing it. It does help to relieve my knee pain.
5	Did have artificial flavors
5	I bought this one as a backup as binding tends to wear down. But I have another one like this and I've had four 5 months. Still works great.
5	Best runner I have ever purchased. Very good quality!
5	If you want to save time, money, and like to eat delicious food this book is for you. There are 70 recipes that have been written with step by step instructions to preparing healthy weight loss lunch recipes.
5	The flavor does not disappoint. Full of chocolate. Mixed perfectly with my coffee...no clumps...and gave me the extra boost I needed with energy and suppressing my appetite. Will be purchasing again!
5	My daughter loves this product to print photos from her phone and clip them onto a hanging string. This is a very easy and quick way to print.
5	I have a Note 8 but this was too cute to pass up. The buttons are slightly off on the sides but still easy to use.
5	They do exactly what I need them to for my combination skin. Love them, but I don't use them as often as I should probably :( ...however when I do my face feels great the next few days.
5	Looks great for my Gryffindor costume. Arrived quickly and well packaged.
5	Product matched expectations. Good value for the price.
5	Works great. Arrived in perfect condition!
5	Good quality classes, bought them for my girlfriend. She loves them, the only complaint is the tint is lighter so don’t expect high sun deflection.
5	Very pleased with purchase & quick delivery!
5	Very warm and fit great
5	Good quality, you won’t be disappointed!
5	I was skeptical that this would work to keep my hound dog quiet - but it works like a charm! Maybe because her nose is more sensitive?? We don't always put her bark collar on, but when we let her out at night when her barking would be more disturbing to neighbors, it works as described. Sometimes we only put the collar on and not activate it - that also works now that she associated the spray with the collar.
5	The entire Ballsy Boys Series is excellent! Looking forward to Pixies story !!! A very big fan of this writer !
5	These are the perfect size and so quiet in the classroom!!!
5	I took the phone out of its box and immediately put the screen protector on, so I didn't even have to clean it. It's pretty good, not exactly as good as a bare screen, but you get the protection. For me, not worrying as much about dropping the phone is important enough to give up the tiny amount of touch that is lost with any screen protector.
5	We bought these for a family trip to Lake Powell where summer daytime temperatures are regularly over 100. These cooling towels worked great to provide cooling relief from the heat. The multi-pack with 6 colors was great because everyone in my family got one and we could keep them straight. Highly recommended!
5	They work perfectly and were so easy to install
5	I'm very happy with this unit. I've read a lot of bad things, but in my case everything is working as it should and I'm very happy with it. I don't however spend a lot of time using it so those of you that are heavy on the soldering may have a more appreciated view than mine.
5	This was a gift, but looks great in person! I love floor puzzles & this Paw Patrol puzzle was very colorful.
5	Great all the way around.
5	Very good value for the price
5	These came in 4 separate packs inside one big plastic pack. They were the perfect size for cake pops. i feel like the 4 inch might work too, will try them and review when i do buy them.
5	There's a lot of value in price.I'll buy it again, and I'll think about more of that.My son also loves that these platforms can be connected at the bottom and top, so you can stack them up.
5	I live how easy it is to stick it into the AirPods. The actual skins are really nice and durable and I especially love their lifetime replacement guarantee which is great for people that worry they might mess the stickers up
5	Beautiful, I absolutely love this set. I wanted a decanter set to add a talking piece in our living room. I do recommend washing them out before you present them it will make them pop.
5	I absolutely LOVE these! Perfect size, and so beautiful.
5	Great table. It is beautiful and sturdy, everything I needed for my front patio.
5	Affordable product works great
5	Love this so much! I put my tree up early, and realized it was broken:( so I ended up with this one because all the ones in stores were SO expensive! This one was super affordable! Easy to assemble and I currently have Halloween decorations all over it! I love it so much!!’
5	We put this amazing light in our finished basement for our kids to enjoy and enjoy they do! As soon as homework is done off to play they go. I am so very pleased with every aspect of this light bulb. Fun for everyone.
5	It does what it's supposed to. Keeps the pesky bugs away.
5	Perfect for my daughter’s Bed. Love how easy it is to put on or take off. Color matched great. Love how it lays too.
5	I lose hair like it’s my job and my plumbing is not a fan. I have not had one issue with clogged drains since I bought this.
5	So glad that I purchased this. This really helps get any extra off my teeth, to the point where I may increase the length of time for dental cleanings. It feels like I've been to the dentist daily. Love it. It take me a few tries figuring out how to use this without spraying the room, but have it down pat now. :)
5	Nice for that price.
5	I’ve been using this product, since purchase. Very impressed
5	exactly what i wanted perfect for mu counter
5	I mean I used it the day it came in to remove a deep clog I had in my toilet and it was like I heard angels singing. WORTH EVERY PENNY!
5	Exactly what I wanted
5	Does exactly as advertised
5	Why didn’t the manufacturer include this? Very good fit in the Tundra and very useful.
5	Well , I guess it works. Like to give it less stars but this was my choice of refrigerators... Extremely expensive and I'm not even sure it was needed yet. It did arrive on time and it fit, as expected.
5	Totally worth every penny.
5	Pistachio Lovers Mix has the perfect mix of nuts. However, the last container I purchased in April 2019 had a few stale pistachios. They had a bitter taste. The other nuts were perfect though. I’ll keep ordering!
5	The cards are made with quality card stock and the pictures are clear, crisp. Absolutely stunning!! I love my cards!!
5	Works just like the OEM
5	I love these bras- BUT i received a black one with white deodorant marks on the pits! So that was a little startling! Sent it back and re ordered another. I hope i don't get the deodorant one again!
5	Smile laundry bag, there are more dirty clothes to see this bag will be happy. Very good quality!
5	I ordered this one for my daughter’s new phone and a completely different one for mine. I hate to admit that hers is so much better! It’s clear, shows off the color nicely, gives a feeling of a sturdy protection and cheap! Very satisfied with the purchase!
5	Keeps battery and oil filter warm. Easier starting when cold. Below 32f
5	Loved these. Unfortunately I forgot to take my keys off of one before handing them into my last job. 😭
5	Very good I like it very much
5	This wasn’t the doll I meant to buy and was pleasantly surprised! Great mistake on my part! This doll eats play-doh and its so much fun! She comes with only one diaper, but it’s not like it gets messy since just play-doh is falling into it. Our girls love to play with this doll and our play-doh kitchen set and cook meals for the baby. The inside of the doll is easily accessible if there is ever any play-doh stuck. The only issue we have had is forgetting to clean out her mouth at the end of play and the next time having to dig out hardened play-doh, but it’s a quick fix.
5	I use these to store diy mascara and eyelash/brow serum and they work just fine. No muss, no fuss! The kit comes with everything needed to make filling a tube as easy as possible. Glad I ordered these.
5	First things first, these are the best I have ever tried. I went to best buy first and tried all of the demo set's. These top all of them hands down. And for $50 just can't beat the price. Amazing product, I highly recommend them.
5	I used these to get through busy airports on vacation and I also used it when my two year old and I were swimming in the ocean. He has no fear and will swim out as far as he can go. The wrist links keep our hands free and I like how the adult wrist link comes off quickly if I need it to, while the toddler end is tougher to take off. These are very sturdy, don't get tangled up, and with the two lengths they are be exactly what I needed no matter the situation. The whistles might be good for an older child, but needless to say, with a two year old, I threw the whistles away. They are LOUD.
5	product 2 days early, and is an excellent coffee. ENJOY
5	My niece loves it! This is her first year in band in middle school, and it's perfect for her.
5	Good quality but gigantic. I new this going in but lol its huge. Coffees lovers Dream . I gave the thermos five stars but only three stars as giftable because most people wouldn't want this big of a thermos that's my opinion. Unless you are the Jolly Green Giant lol
5	Great price and lightly roasted for easy eating
5	Not beginner level. My 10 yr old is loving this. The colors are bright and the pattern is easy to read.
5	very cute. perfect baby shower gift for a friend
5	love the bands--will will order more colors-easy to install as well
5	Really enjoyed this movie lots!
5	Easy to get the right amount of honey for a perfect cup of tea. Tasty.
5	it's amazing. this is my first time to use banding tapes like this, I am so lucky to find it works well for me. the tape really help to protect he joint tissue and relieve pains. and it lasts very long. I will definitely buy more.
5	Awesome stuff. Works great. I keep ordering only because she keep dropping the phone in the toilet. I recommend to everyone. Good job guys!
5	Purchased for my husband, he absolutely loves it. Easy to insert his phone and take it out. Keeps phone secure with Velcro closure. Simply AWESOME
5	A must have for pc builds and any electronic project. It also works like a datasheet with many interesting specs from different brands and dimensions
5	A great set of Lego's when you're looking for a small gift but not too small! MINECRAFT seems to put together sets that all kiddos seem to love. It's amazing watching their little minds going as they put these together, very satisfied!
5	This works great. I love the comfort of the band, it fits just right. It has been keeping me in track getting my daily steps in. I am shocked how much I wake up with the sleep app.. very enlightening
5	Anker has become my favorite go to brand for cell phone accessories. This charger works great and is just what I need!
5	Great to be able to purchase additional magnet pens for my kids things!!
5	these are super cute, i pair them with my little one outfits, they are absolutely adorable and warm especially in the winter, I put them on with her ugg boots..
5	Bought as a gift for my niece. She loves it. Pretty good quality. Works great. Would purchase again! Perfect for all the JoJo lovers!
5	This carabiner is strong and locks well. I'm using it to hold a water bottle to a day pack, and also appreciate that it is lightweight.
5	Bought this product for my husband and he likes it they think they are nice and useful and works good as he expected too. Overall , he likes it and likes using it !
5	Yes, I cleaned my phone surface correctly HANDS DOWN THE BEST SCREEN GUARD FOR YOUR PHONE Do not hesitate to buy this product, it is the best screen protector out in the market I have never installed a screen protector myself before and although it should be simple I have seen enough bubbles and badly aligned protectors to know it isn't as easy as it looks This is my second purchase Much easier to install than the plastic type
5	For the price cant go wrong. Ive only had it a short time so cannot make statement regarding its longevity.
5	Excellent feedback, The action is better than my 3 year old green clicky. Agian a great product for the dollar.
5	Very funny movie. Kept me watching
5	Just what I needed to sharpen my Arrow Broadheads.
5	My 1 and a half year old loves the toy and it keeps her entertained very easily. She gets frustrated and needs help occasionally so I do need to be close by. I used it the most on a plane ride and it was wonderful entertainment for her :)
5	I really like these socks and have purchased several sets over the past few months. While I ordered the ones pictured, I did not receive the colors I thought I had ordered (as noted by other buyers). That is ok and I will not deduct a point for that, as it is not the seller that I am rating. The socks stay put, are comfortable, and look absolutely adorable with boots. Great product.
5	I have been looking for a low price smart watch, and I finally found one. It not only tracks fitness, and heart rate, but it notifies me when I have a call or text. Something that not all of the fitness watches do..
5	Wall mount arrived quickly. Seems to be well made and sturdy. Mounted my LCD TV with it. All the parts and accessories came with it. Does the job that was expected. Can't beat the price compared to a retail store. Love it, five stars!
5	Love these, I have been using them every night and I can't tell you how relieved my mussels feel after the fact. A lil bit of bruising on my legs, but it's winter here and nothing a pair of dark tides can't hide. Love them. I also used them on my husband's back and he loved it.
5	Loved it!!!!!! I used it for standing in lines at Disney World and it really did the job to keep me hands free.
5	Looked cute in my daughter’s dorm room
5	Nice looking very modern, slick design and plenty of pocket. Feet perfect MacBook Pro 13”
5	Once you start reading you will never put it down. With every page turn you find excitment
5	I like that it’s not to tight on my wrist.
5	Nice and bright and covers a pretty big circumference ~ the dog leash doesn't over run the brightest area so it makes it easy for me to see my pup
5	Tube worked perfectly and was delivered fast
5	By far my favorite of Hank's books. The thoughtful detail that went into differentiating between the "light" and "dark" meat small games species was unexpected. Having the legends on each recipe, showing the game subs you can use is also a nice touch. Even if you don't hunt, this book will be great to add to your library as the variety of recipes is sure to keep you inspired in the kitchen.
5	As advertised and fast delivery.
5	Use these for my crochet projects to hold pieces in place while stitching them together
5	Finally sheets that actually fit the Cal. King and are deep enough for a pillowtop mattress. Getting 4 pillow cases was a huge benefit because when you have a king you always use at least four pillows, a practical and nice looking set of sheets
5	Used to house a vast collection of DVDs, Blu Ray and video games.
5	I give these out to all my cpr students. Perfect size for the keychain!
5	The perfect backpack for me. Allows me to carry a change of clothes,tablet and my laptop to and from work. I've also used it as a camera backpack.
5	Bought this to sand guitar bodies and so far it has worked perfectly. After sanding there is little to no dust in the air because of the vacuum bag attached. The handle fits very comfortably in my and makes it easy to maneuver. I would highly recommend this product!
5	Works great as long as you dont submerge.... Great product
5	There were no problems with the order. The frames were good quality for the price and the packaging was outstanding.
5	This bedding set is better then I hoped. In the pictures the pattern on the sheets looks like a gray color. In reality it's a lovely purple like the flowers on the comforter. Nothing shrank when we washed it. It all came out perfect. My daughter loves it.
5	I love the satin sheets, pillow cases and duvet cover. It is very comfortable and I feel like a princess sleeping in my bed. I would definitely buy these again and other colors. I love everything about this Sad but most of all I love the pillowcases because cotton pillowcases snag my hair and damaging the satin ones keep my hair nice and smooth
5	Everything works as expected. Love my Pi.
5	Keeps my hair products tidy on my dresser, and prevents them from burning the wood top.
5	This DS came with both its original stylus, charging cable, GBA dust cover, and a neat travel case. The condition of the system itself is remarkable given its age and prior ownership.
5	Beautiful filled with candies for kids as a shower gift. Lol..
5	Bought this for my moms and she was pretty happy when she called me about it! She said it looked beautiful and tasted delish!
5	We are not vegetarians, but everyone in my family likes healthy nutrition. In this book we found very good recipes. This book is great for vegetarians, or even just for people who want to cook more vegetarian dishes, such as we. Recipes are easy to follow and I believe you will enjoy these dishes.
5	She has lost some motion in her hands and this works great!
5	Loved the product. Quality is really good. Happy with it. Thanks.
5	Great Product! These gave me a lot more energy and made me feel great! Will buy again.
5	Just as described and pictured, perfectly packaged and works great.
5	Perfect size for the pool!
5	Awesome! awesome awesome awesome. Nicely painted, its nifty the way it folds up and it rolls great! Does not feel cheap at all and it actually handles the weight of pantry canned foods when I reorganized things. I look forward to utilizing this some more in my home.
5	really awesome product that just works flawless!
5	This mattress pad covers the mattress completely and fits pretty good! It is also very soft and durable. I give it 5 from 5 star)
5	It just did what I wanted. Easy. Elegant.
5	Didn't dislike anything, perfect for my needs. The white is so pretty it looks like my wreath is hanging with a pretty ribbon.
5	Great quality. Hooked right up to my monitors and stand. No complication whatsoever. The fit is a little tight, but you want that with $200+ monitors.
5	Those bath bomb are just great. My kids love it. Bath time turned into an exciting time, they enjoy the shiny colorful wrap and then the toy at the end, it's really a hit. Will definitely buy it again
5	So after an issue with sneaky mice, ones that evaded the snap traps we had to resort to using sticky trap and have found success with them. Snap traps should be your first approach as they are fast and clean kill but when used correctly sticky traps can be valuable, especially in the case of young mice that won't set off snap traps due to how light they are. Be certain to set the sticky trap in a spot where other animals won't potentially come in contact with them. Trapping birds, snakes or lizards (or your household pet) on these boards would be horrific! Be sure to check them daily if not several times a day. Once you have caught a mouse chances are it's still alive and the kindest thing to do is to quickly dispatch it. I've used a snap traps for this, placing a liner over the mouse to allow the snap trap to make clean contact instead of getting stuck in the goo and prolonging the process. Baiting the trap isn't necessary, just place it along walls the mice or rats use. You may discover you have more than one mouse in an area if you place a rat size trap out for mice. Please, please, if you can't resolve the situation with snap traps alone than use these but NEVER resort to rodent poison if at all possible! The horrible damage it does to wildlife is astronomical as it doesn't stop with the rodent but is passed on to every predator and scavenger in the ecosystem.
5	I am a young 41. I need to look like I feel. A girlfriend recommended this product and I was weary but the price point was good and I took a shot. Totally worth it. I had to go on YouTube to figure out how to use it because the directions were hard to read and a little confusing. After a couple of uses my husband noticed. It made my day. I love this product.
5	Love this case. Easy to use. Seems to protect the iPad very well. I like how it will prop up the iPad to watch a video. Highly recommend.
5	I do not plan on using any other broad head until I cannot purchase these! They haven't let me down yet.
5	Great product. Arrived quickly, works as advertised.
5	Best made product out there
5	Arrived as described perfect for goodie bags or prizes for kids. Love the variety of toys and colors so it’s gender neutral and there’s plenty to pick from. For the prize it’s worth it.
5	Fast shipping. Figures were great.
5	As advertised. Quick set up. Very satisfied.
5	The color is pretty good When i need warmer just turn on Wait 10's can be heat heated quickly I can hang it in the bag Looking nice, love it
5	Awesome tray. Loved loved it!!
5	Great set and covers most needs quality is good
5	All that I can say is if you need something to clean floor and not able to get down on the floor the you need this mop kit.
5	In October I was going to cosplay as a male version of Cruella. To dress and play the part at work since I work in the fine arts at the school. Everyone from students and colleagues enjoyed it! I had so much fun playing the villain lol. :)
5	Smells great and lasts almost all day!
5	I've never used a spiralizer before, but as far as I can tell this does its job well. I get super long even sized zucchini noodles. I bought it specifically for zucchini and haven't tried it for anything else, but it works well for those. Easy to clean, simple. I thought about getting a big fancy machine but decided that was probably more work than it was worth and it would just end up sitting in the back of a cupboard forgotten because I wouldn't be motivated to pull it out, put it all together and then clean it after. This is simple, small and easy to clean and store.
5	Looks just like the pic. A little tricky to open at first but not hard to figure out. Even has rounded edges for the 9plus features. Very happy with purchase , highly recommend.
5	Enough to fit in four pairs of shoes
5	Our dog Radar has put so many holes in his Jolly Ball we can’t count them. The ball is amazing. It holds its shape even though he compresses it when he bites down and carries it around. Definitely one of the best toy buys we’ve made.
5	This is my second time ordering this product I am 55 168 pounds I purchased a large it when I got to that their role I purchased a medium and it is what it looks like. I’m sorry I couldn’t get the video but here’s a picture of me in a large
5	Great quality. Wonderful product. Fast shipping.
5	Fit and works perfect in my 97 ranger
5	I love love these Christmas lights, we have always had lights but for the first time I was able to control it using a remote control... it’s a very nice feature and my kids love it. The unit is not very bulky like many others that I have seen, the color is bright n covers a large area. I have received a ton of compliments on these... Fast Shipping too...
5	Love these socks! I'm still wearing them after labor and delivery.
5	My husband stated just the other day how much he liked the shakers, especially the pepper since he likes course pepper.
5	This is hard to find in the stores,but I love it for tight lining. It glides on,and stays put,and does not irritate my eyes.
5	Fantastic! Easy to use. I cooked the green beans. They got fully cooked so quickly!
5	Exactly what I ordered
5	You can connect to arduino devices
5	This product is super light weight! Flexible and easy to grab during a ride. Love it and will order a matching one for the other cage!
5	so many tools all in a small easy to use product. very fast service. thank You
5	I have had a couple pizza stones and by far I have enjoyed using this one the best. Helps get a nice crust. Nice even cook and easy clean up. Fit great on my Weber.
5	Sent this instead of a traditional Easter basket and totally exceeded my expectations, health conscious girlfriend loved it and there was a rubber bunny her poodle loves!
5	Love this pet feeder! It has automatic feedings so I don’t have to worry about feeding my dog anymore. The camera and microphone quality are very good! I love the fact that I can check up on her when I’m not home.
5	Fits amazing and is protective. And the buttons even stay shiny.
5	Ring is big, beautiful and of good quality.
5	Great read, it's helpes me to solidify what I already know and look at things from a different way of thinking. I t's also helped me out to improve myself and gives the power to control my emotions. I really satisfied to have this.
5	Pleasantly surprised. Great price, great packaging, great, healthy little plant!
5	Lots of comfort when playing my 10.25 pound bass for long practices and shows.
5	This was my wedding song years ago. It still stops my husband in his tracks whenever he hears it.
5	The child likes it very much. It is played every day after receiving the goods. Although it is plastic, there is almost no smell. The egg shape is really unique. It is very helpful for the children to recognize the color and the number,very satisfied.
5	Used this while hiking and absolutely loved it. Very comfortable and easy to use. Held my phone, keys and two water bottles with plenty of space to spare. Material is a good quality and seems very durable. Would recommend to a friend.
5	Nice screen protector. Privacy screen works well at side angles. Would recommend it to others because it also covers the top and bottom portion and not just the screen.
5	Smells amazing and is great for your skin
5	Perfect for my tablet and mouse. It's well made and sturdy.
5	Great game but it needs more content.
5	perfect for GD present
5	Does the job - hard to calibrate, but it's relative.
5	I'm amazed that it is possible to get such insightful quality information for such a great price. Clarified some myths and aiding me in making some prudent stock trading decisions. Will be watching SEC investigations more closely now )).
5	Bought for friends Birthday she loved it and it looks great on her wall
5	I needed something dimmable and USB powered. This is perfect. I don't use the mixed or warm color gel option much, cool light and 10 settings for brightness are awesome. What a great light!
5	Love this! I cut 4 zucchinis in to slices in just seconds.... Can't wait to try it on other veggies.
5	My son loves this swaddle. At first we had a swaddle from the hospital where we tucked in his hands. We realized later on that he likes to sleep with his hands up. So we gave this swaddle a try. It is awesome! He is not fighting it at all and the material is very nice.
5	The lights are as described and are bright.I had hoped they were a little brighter,but I think this is as bright as a 15w light gets and they will do for what I need them for.The price is very reasonable,compared to the same lights that are being advertised.
5	Absolutely stunning! I love this product! It was much better than what I expected. It looks better than it does in the photograph. I highly recommend it. I love looking at it each time I go in my living room. I couldn't have been more pleased!!
5	I wore this throughout the winter. SO comfy! Fits perfect!
5	My son is 3 years old & autistic. It is hard to find age appropriate toys for him that lite up & have sound. This is for Christmas so I have not given it to him yet but I do think he will enjoy it.
5	I got these in white. I just hiked in them. I’m 8 months pregnant and they form fit right to me without being too tight on the baby which is very important! I can also tell that they will easily fit me when I’m not pregnant. I’m 5’7, 170 lbs. normally am 145-150 when not pregnant. The white isn’t see through at all. Material is thick. And so so comfy! I WILL order this in other colors and maybe double up on the white pair!
5	Our 2.5 year old grandchild really likes to play this game!
5	I am 63 and have been waking up with some puffiness around my eyes in the mornings. I like Best Eye Gel which has taken care of that problem in about 15 minutes after waking.
5	This provides a very strong hold for your hair so you'll have to experiment with this product in the beginning to achieve your desired effects. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and start off with a small amount. Then add more if needed.
5	I’ve had these on for a week with zero problems. As a bartender and xray tech, I’m very rough with my hands. This picture was just taken, after a week of wear and picking through half a dozen crabs. Never going to the nail salon again! Instead of the glue that came with these nails, I used Ibd 5 second nail glue.
5	I get soooo many compliments!!!!!
5	Fast service and an excellent product! Thank you so much!
5	I love these bracelets for my Fitbit. They are easy to install and comfortable to wear. Plus you can't beat the price.
5	If you use plug in headphones this is a must need if you also need to charge your phone. This solves the issue with using the Apple earbuds all day on calls and being able to charge your iPhone as the same time.Well made,Sturdy, and seem to be working well. works fine in my iPhone 7 plus.
5	I love this bag and it was a great price. Two different straps...awesome!
5	Great wig for the price! Very soft, realistic.
5	Looks nice, sturdy, easy to put together.
5	The colors are great! they are super bold! All the pins arrived intact and in working order. The little pins are mini, but they are super cute and i can't wait to make tiny crafts with the tiny humans.
5	The price and quality very good
5	A little different from usual Braun tales but enjoyable reading
5	No complaints with this one! - Amazing price for a reliable name brand. - Mama's happy with it, so life is good!

5	My favorite always have one in my car
5	So I purchased these for my vehicle my husband installed them and said they were easy to install and a great price compared to the parts store around the corner and they were packaged well and arrived on time. Very happy with the purchase as now I don't get hit in the head every time I open the rear of my suburban, it actually stays up like it supposed too ;)
5	My son loves nightmare before Christmas and these were perfect for him
5	Fits the fire hd 10 perfectly and the graphics are lovely and very vibrant.
5	This is a great album. Really enjoyed listening to it. Evie has such a lovely voice, you feel the presence of God when she sings. :) Really shows the true reason for the season, Jesus! :)
5	This is an excellent Triathlon training book, covering all the important aspects of Triathlon. Meredith Atwood uses her personal experience with expert advice mixed in to create a wonderful book. Everyone can relate to the personal experiences and will benefit from all the up to date information and tips on each individual sport as well as the race itself. Highly recommend it.
5	In my training program, resistance bands are often used not only for exercise, but also as part of the warm-up and relaxation stages, as well as for stretching and active work.
5	I read this in only a few hours. It was absolutely heartwrenching.
5	I bought it for a tent bag and it worked out great
5	Very happy with these. But them.
5	This was a gift for my mother and she loved it, the only problem is she wanted two!
5	I’m so excited! These actually worked I was surprised! I’ve got three kids who love to spill their drinks at the restaurants!! Momma was prepared today! It is on the cups they give u at restaurants in picture.
5	I mistakenly ordered the case before my robot was operational. The case is of good quality but I am returning it since I am returning the robot.
5	I am learning bass guitar and I have the standard Squier by Fender model guitar. I wasnt expecting much from this stand but its compact and seems sturdy and holds the guitar fine. It stays in one room for now, its perfect if you need a stand to hold the instrument inbetween practice sessions.
5	Tone Soap is always good.
5	fantastic belt, if you prefer a leather belt that's firm this is not for you. this soft feel is very smooth and comfortable.
5	SO WORTH IT!! no shedding, natural, just the right amount of pieces. I use my homemade oil to give it a little moisture. Hair remains sooo soft . Highly recommend ‼️
5	I love it! Great quality and get lots of compliments.
5	Great quality and fantastic price.
5	So glad I purchased this. No more phones falling out of my hands and on to my face in bed. A huge win.
5	well built. withstands the outdoor elements.
5	Nice coin purse and just the right size!
5	I was concerned that this might not fit my hubby’s bow. I reached out via message and got the help I needed to give a surprise gift that actually made my guy happy!
5	I really enjoyed this thriller! Twists and turns kept me guessing. Full recommended.
5	This case is the right size for my registration, insurance card & other similar documents. It fits nicely on top of the case that keeps all the manuals that came with the car.
5	I use my mobile phone constantly throughout the day for work and need headphones to so I can have both hands free. These headphones are amazing, comfortable, and a great buy.
5	It is cheap and works.
5	I bought this for a huge WWE fan. He loved it and showed it off to his big sister.
5	Husband likes these for outside
5	Worked wonderfully to clean up our leather seats. Was wondering if anything was Avery going to work and then we found this. Very happy and highly recommend. Wish we had done before and after pictures!
5	I really like these headphones. I'm not a hardcore audiophile but most of the in ear headphones that I've used either have decent bass response but sound dull on the higher frequencies or have clear highs but wind up sounding tinny because of poor low end performance. Most headphones use either balanced armature or dynamic drivers each of which has its pros and cons. These incorporate both types of technology into their drivers . I'm not a sound engineer but the end result is deep resonant bass, bright clear highs and warm midtones with excellent separation between instruments. They are also loud. The noise cancelling is just passive, which is the only downside, but active noise cancellation adopted for earbud style headphones has it's own set of drawbacks. At $60 they aren't cheap but they sound a lot better than Beats that are twice as much money. I'm very happy with them and I think they are a relative bargain.
5	Daughter loved the decorations, birthday balloons added just the right touch!
5	This adapter worked great for attaching an HDMI cable box to a VGA projector. High quality adapter. A+ packaging. It's a great value.
5	My daughter had one but the arm broke. She was so happy when we found this one.
5	Wife using as we speak!
5	Loved this series!! Though I do wish the ending was more, it was a bit predictable. Wished maybe it was like further into the future. I absolutely loved how strong willed Riley was, that she didn't just give in cuz she was in love with Beck. So definitely worth reading, sad that it's over!
5	This is now the second one I have purchased. My son goes through Sippy cups like crazy because all other brands that claim to be durable don’t last more than a couple months. NOT THIS ONE these are top rack dishwasher safe which was a major selling point for me along with the wide mouth bottle neck and spill proof lid. It even has a little ring like handle that makes it easier on my 2yr old to carry around everywhere.
5	works great for a good price- all you really need -
5	Super fast shipping!!!!! Great deal!!!!! The best brushes in the world for detangling your hair with ease in my opinion!!!!!!!!! Beautiful brush design!!!!!!
5	At less than $0.50 a hanger I can't beat this price. They are sturdy, standard children's hangers. My 3 and 4 year olds can use these easily and have not broken any so they are rugged enough for my use.
5	amazingly cute. I now want other families from this manufacturer
5	Came just as expected, good quality and great price.
5	Works great on erasing tailor pencil lines and leaves no residue on the clothing.
5	helps with my slow saliva output
5	Comfortable and durable
5	Great quality. Dropped my phone down cement stairs and the screen protector barely cracked in one corner. Would definitely purchase again. Very easy to install as well.
5	Iron man is a great movie with lots of action and excitement.
5	It turned out just like the picture I sent. I am getting it matted and framed to give to friends for Christmas. I will do this again.
5	These feel great! I was hoping the cut was lower, but they’ll be fine with long pants.
5	I bought this for a friend who planned to travel outside the country. I told her it was to wear in case she was robbed--in the event a loss but not a GREAT loss. It is so pretty she was worried it would invite a robbery! (She wasn't robbed but really enjoyed wearing it.)
5	Great product I swear a lot and this helps on special occasions when I wear a suit. Only dislike is the deep deep v neck
5	These are a great color and were packaged very nicely - received with no scratches, easy and quick to assemble. The price was a bit high but I feel like these are pretty good quality. I will probably buy another set soon!
5	It is incredible, just lifts you up, gives you a sense of joy and happiness ! Also more energy and focus ! I love it !
5	Great package of tools for mathematicians, woodworking, arts and crafts, etc. The price is very affordable for everything it includes. Would buy again!
5	Nice combo of sizes.
5	great quality! would recommend
5	Omg these are the cutest and just as I imagined! They are more like a postcard rather than like a folded over card. They are perfect size and super cute!
5	I always support small business. Good product. Keep it up.
5	What I like it is the art from the book (characters) even the dice .
5	i like it a lot because it's very soft and comfy. good choice!
5	Good phone over and good price
5	Fantastic knife for the price. I am really glad that I bought. I can’t believe that it works so well. Very sharp.
5	Great item. Take your time in applying and take your time in lining up as out by any will not work with cases. I have an otterbox defender and it's perfect. I used a little bit of heat to help it set on the edges. I brought 2 x boxes but used 1 box in learning how to apply and My mistake but got a spare protector when I'm ready should I need to replace.
5	Really sturdy plastic, fast boiling and doesn’t scale you to the touch. I’m really pleased.
5	Perfection! Thank you so much for creating this!
5	I like it. Does the job as advertised.
5	It’s so easy to install and works as advertised! Purchased twice !
5	The product came as ordered.
5	This concealer works miracles! My favorite ever and excellent price! Fast shipping too!
5	I have a small space and these products were just the right fit. Sturdy and small. Just what I needed.
5	Exactly as expected again best part brought right to my door
5	Bravo Dennis! I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to take charge of their destiny. Great real life tools to help you move forward.
5	Bigger than i expected. Great gift
5	Really well made and attractive
5	Perfect for the look I was going for at my son's Eagle Scout Court of Honor!!! I received so many compliments. Thank you!!!
5	Exactly what we needed. Replaced an old broken case. Now the classic iPod is back in its protection.
5	Used it for storing wedding dress. It is perfectly what I had in mind, as advertised, seems well made.
5	I got these to replace the mid-century inspired legs on our leather side chair. These legs matched the style of everything else in our living room. I was so happy when they fit perfectly! I'm so glad we got them.
5	Nice looking little flashlight. I use a rechargeable AAA. The three levels of brightness let me choose the amount of light I need and the flashlight looks pretty good too. I'm happy with the product and the price!
5	So in love with this case! It reminds me of the scene in lilo in stitch where he opens his mouth and the music comes out. Has not gotten dirty and has not broken. Really amazing product!!!!
5	Multiple sizes so works well for charging in kitchen, or near the bed. good product, not too costly and works well.
5	Shipped fast and looks like it will be the perfect replacement part and we will have plenty of spares should we need them, lol.
5	Watch band and case works great, mine cracked underneath at set screw. Just had to purchase another one so I didnt loose my watch.
5	great little journal. very thick cover which I didn't expect, so that was a nice suprise
5	I plopped this in my oversized leather tote and it’s been a game-changer. I can find my keys and instantly feel like a more organized human. Totally recommend! If this review was helpful please let me know by clicking the “Helpful” button below the review.
5	Beautiful bag and is holding up perfectly
5	Nice quality well built. The gate mouth works well push it open and it stays open.
5	Have to set the timings and voltage manually on an AMD board, but works great after that. I'm still working on over clocking it, but I'm sure I can get 2400 MHz minimum out of it.
5	Very emotional movie about a daughter who found the site where her father, who died when she was 3 yrs. old, was buried along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
5	Good knife...Good quality.
5	Everyone who visits us and see this asks where we'd get it. the light turns on automatically, emitting a soft warm glow ans it's 100% Safe. No need for wires and batteries. After getting this, all you have to do is to enjoy the pretty lights.
5	I love this book bag- it's great if your a commuter and you have to take a little of EVERYTHING with you. it holds my two planners, my journal, my kindle, make up, workout clothing, water bottle, my pen collection (cause everything must be color coded), and my lunch. I'm a bit obsessed with this bag.
5	Great little kit. Great price and value
5	Super easy to install. Sturdy and a nice finish on it. Took 15 mins to install, doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb either.
5	this is the most perfect nightshirt I've had in years... I'm about a 12/14 and go L or XL - this was an XL and it was perfect and even looks cute. The fabric is a little heavier weight so I can actually show myself to houseguests without feeling naked. I'll order a couple more!!
5	My son likes it for his minions room!
5	Love these. Smell and feel great on my skin. I'm super sensitive but these soaps do the trick. Suggestion, make sure you get a tray that drains the water otherwise these soap like any soap will break down fast.
5	It was very enjoyable. Am looking forward to the 3rd book, Avenger. So far I haven’t been able to order it.
5	Really good fountain. Long waterproof wire so can place the solar panel in the most sunny spot which is good as my pond is in a fully shaded spot to control/prevent algea growth. Multiple choice of fountain sprays and long plastic tubes so worked really well
5	Screen protectors are a must for any device that has a breakable front. I drop my phone a lot...... I’m a clutz. I also have weird ocd so when I apply a screen protector I will go crazy if it is not exact. The tray really helped out! I haven’t dropped my phone so I can’t say how it is durability wise. It arrived quickly.
5	This was a gift for my dad. He loved it.Sturdy &&definitely worth the price.
5	They are definitely durable, True to fit, comfortable. I used them as work shorts so they are a little thicker than I would like being in 100 degree weather but I guess that's how they withstand so much wear and tear. It's a win in my book
5	Great amount of product for the price! Easily installed and works great
5	More than a trash/can it’s human, oh yeah simple human, I’m broke, but you can’t tell by my kitchen thanks to my sexy STainless STeel back against the wall smooth lid closing machine!!!
5	This item looks exactly as it's pictured, and it made me so happy that half the money goes to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
5	The best thing about this screen protector is the privacy. As advertised this protector gives the privacy so it's hard to see the screen from the different angles than straight. The screen protector works perfectly on my phone. I would definitely buy again!
5	Good taste...works great for colds and flu...people sick all season here in Alabama...stomach virus and flu...not me...one a day does the trick!
5	The ball comes not inflated, and when you first inflate it, it looks lopsided, since it was packed for a while. After a bit of time, it looks perfectly round. Works great!
5	Great product for the money.
5	Really great. I thought they were gonna be smaller. It says for small dogs but for me it looks like the size is of a medium. I’m not complaining. My dogs love it.
5	This is te 2nd UFO drone I've purchased. This model is better than the one I purchased previously from another seller. It holds up better and flies longer. I'd purchase again
5	Will definitely recommend! Best charger cord
5	I use this weekly or even more. Cooking is a chore, so using the crock to make meals for the week is a plus. The item is nice to look at, so doesn't take away from the room, and easy to use. I'd recommend for anyone who is a lazy cooker like myself!
5	Love these Christmas earrings...They look great with my Christmas necklace!
5	The perfect size. Very well constructed. I would definitely purchase again!!
5	Used for a power supply for a fish-tank LED hood, worked like a charm.
5	Bought this as a gift.
5	Very strong only need 1 or 2 drops.
5	I didn't receive my order shiny jewelry USA mens iced
5	It changes fast, and for my cellphone
5	Fun for the children
5	Works well and I use it for all my presentations. I also have the Logitech model, but this one has a better and solid battery door latch. Having the USB receiver stored in the body is great...no losing it!!! Laser pointer works well and is sharp and clear. Slide buttons and laser button are a bit too close together for big fingers, but OK. Nice to have battery-low light as well. Case is very nice as well.
5	Amazing value, works great, and its nice and sleek! Very happy with this chrome book.
5	use this on my fruit and always love it
5	Smaller than I envisioned but does the job.
5	Well made and good price.
5	Charged fast, and sound is fantastic. Easy to pair up with my Samsung phone. Absolutely love it
5	These are great and so easy to use
5	This book is great for healing the soul, also if you feel empty inside this book is for you.
5	Lives can seem jumbled up or a mess, but with each breath, there are new chances. Each of us, touch people who are around us.
5	dont know about the protection , but a great fitting walet! i like the fact that the compartments are vertical
5	I like the fact it has an area for credit cards.
5	The sleep game has been changed. Awesome weighted blanket.
5	Performs as expected. No problems with shoddy construction.
5	Loved the colors. The fit was perfect. Would order again.
5	Product as described. Fast shipping.
5	The 15" size is perfect for so many things. It is lightweight and yet heavy duty.
5	love this a lot work is very good for me
5	Sharp, easy to use - best we've ever tried!
5	These cords are well made and seem like they will last. I liked the variety of lengths. The plug is tight fitting and doesn't come unplugged when you don't want it to.
5	Helpful; drop my phone much less now, Lol. Plus, if you fidget, it comes in handy! Lol
5	Was exactly as described!
5	Exactly what I was expecting!! Great product!! Thank You!! 👍👍👍👍👍
5	Got these for a bargain deal and am very happy with the product. The pampers are soft as always and work well!
5	grandfather thought he would like the open to but says they tend to roll up on him and become uncomfortable so be sure to try closed toe first. the quality was fine just a personal comfort issue.
5	it's a very good bag. It's lightweight, can be folded away and has a ton of room for everything.
5	It works better than I expected, I really like that I can sit outside at night.
5	My puppies shed like crazy! These allowed us to go outside and pet them for a half an hour and they love it and we create quite the tumble weed of dog fur. Much less intimidating for the dogs and much easier to use for us. No need to keep pulling off like a traditional brush
5	Perfect for Texas weather
5	Great product and seller!
5	CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT
5	This the first I have used this tape. It is hand above the tape I used before. Easier to handle and goes on smoothly.
5	Love these. My go to for gym socks.
5	Everything was great they loved the toys
5	This might be the smartest device I have. It is the perfect size for my car, was easy to assemble and keeps my iPhone 7 in plain view.The instructions for fitting the device came ahead of time which made the entire experience a pleasure.
5	Bought for smaller bike - excellent value for money! Good fit and finish. You need to be mechanically inclined- drilling, measuring skills are must.
5	Great product. I taped it to laptop screen and it delivers well in glare and privacy shield.
5	Very Beautiful!!! Looks nice with my sunflower decor.
5	Perfect, I have no complaints.
5	I have both the black and clear silicone versions. The black is very slippery, but the clear silicone has some grip to it. Yes, its a fingerprint magnet and gets greasy when use, but a quick wipe down with a barely damp cloth restores the texture. The kickstand is easily the best I've ever used and super sturdy.
5	A little smaller than I expected but they are beautiful they were a Christmas gift for my mom
5	Got these for some stocking stuffers for my sticker obsessed daughter. Incredible quality, no repeats, and a great assortment of superheroes, video games, and pop culture. Would be great as a stocking stuffer or gift bag goodies for any school aged kids or sticker obsessed people.
5	Easy to install and does the job well.
5	I do keto, and at times struggle with my electrolyte intake, and also bounce off and on the diet occasionally. I have been taking these a few weeks now, and I have noticed I feel much better having an electrolyte replacement. I lose so much fluid on keto that I often have weak moments and flu like symptoms if I am not careful. These have helped tremendously.
5	GReat for running! Connect automatically to my phone when the earbuds are turned on.
5	I loved these! They fit great and were actually flattering. I did wear a bra underneath them because they don't have any padding, but they had the same type of clasp of my bras so it was easy.
5	This is a fantastic charger for the price. I just now found out that the iPhone 8 and onward can be fast charged with a USB-C PD charger. Paired with a good USB-C to Lightning cable the combo charged my iPhone 8 from 2% to 57% in 37 minutes. Towards the end of the charge- 90% onward...the charging speed is slowed- but this is normal for most chargers. If you are in a emergency situation or need your phone charged fast- this item will do it. Very happy with purchase.
5	Beautiful look. Works well.
5	My daughter looks beautiful It’s perfect Am using it as tinker bell dress
5	Wow, amazing how I got this product just in couple days, It's perfect unit for me to plug in my Christmas tree lighting and control through my voice control! This unit is so easy to set up, just as other apps compatible with Alexa! (yes definately a big fan of Alexa :P) if you have questions don't know how to set it up, please go over their instructions, very detailed teach how to set it up step by step. Highly recommended this unit with such price!!
5	My son wanted a drone and I was not sure I made some research and found this one and he’s loving it!! It is so easy to learn how to use it, it’s been a while and seems in great condition, definitely is worth every penny (great price by the way)
5	Very cute!! Exactly like the picture!!
5	This backpack will hold it all! Ruger 9mm, Taurus Judge, S&W Shield 9mm, Glock 40 and S&W 38 revolver. Held all the ammo I needed for a one hour session at the range. Padded all around, plenty of pockets for mags, loaders, whatever. Just had it a little over a week and it seems like will hold up well!
5	KNIPEX is the best manufacturer for all hand tools, especially pliers
5	Excellent Quality - They look great on all desk of my wife office and home too - Everyone ask where I bought it...
5	Obsessed, great quality and stylish
5	Very easy to install and remove. It is also very convenient to carry. Use it to clean the garbage in the swimming pool and it will not leak out. It is really practical. Its price is also very affordable.
5	Met all expectations. Would buy again from this vendor
5	Great shoe. Third pair I've owned over the past 3 years. Well worth the money.
5	I loved these balloons they were reasonably priced and were great for a birthday party. I made balloon columns with the Minnie heads and they held up very well.
5	Read that this cannot go in the dishwasher, which is inconvenient. Dries everything great and use it every day so I love it anyway.
5	This is probably my 6th pair of Reef Ginger flip flops. I purchase a new pair every other year, they are so comfy!
5	Very cool eyeliner, easy to draw I really like, the brush is thin, it is waterproof. I recommend this product. Thank you so much. I'm happy.
5	Very pleased with the product, the ease of ordering and the timing of delivery. Thanks.
5	Perfect for lifting and dumb bells. Really helped avoid calluses from the metal bar.
5	I bought this outdoor Christmas Projector Lights so I can be ready for Christmas. It can be used outdoor or indoor. It has nice snow fall down effect + other Christmas theme images which will make the outside of house looking perfect.
5	I've tried several of the "economy" non-Kohler branded spray heads of this type. These Kohler spray heads are superior. We have very hard water, and for some reason the hard water causes problems with cheap heads much faster.
5	Good quality, looks great!
5	Was able to pack in blind, gun, chairs and decoys. Perfect for me to take my 2 young boys Turkey hunting
5	This is over any expectations!! I was looking for a decent bag all over $100. The leather really nice genuine and thick. For the price it’s great deal. This one Even better than Aldo bags. Thanks to the brand
5	This is a really nice belt. Good product
5	I found this item on Amazon, and wasn't expecting it. Another source dried up. But then I found this one and delivery was far faster than expected.
5	I love this brand of ghost peppers. They are the whole chili- so I just grind them to make powder for my cooking. They have the best flavor and heat level of any ghost pepper powders I have tried. A tiny bit goes a long way! Will continue to use these!
5	I am very pleased with this purchase. I bought it because I have a bamboo type a luggage rack in the same room and it really adds to the Casablanca type atmosphere. Would buy again.
5	Really a step above the standard po brush. Love the ability to get in corners and clean multiple angles without repositioning on the pole.
5	I love the rich purple color. I bought for my toy poodles and it works amazingly. I havent had any issues as of yet. I bought another size blade other than the one one it comes with. So easy to swap between blades. Dont forget to couple with Andis cool care for disinfecting and cooling the blades because they do heat up
5	I love this case especially the little hearts in the back that move in some kind of fluid. Now my sister wants one
5	This is the second one I have purchase. My backyard lights up like daylight. Both plugged into a remote control extension which is plugged into an outdoor outlet. Much better than any solar light.
5	Works great!!! Will order again in the future!! Thanks
5	My daughter loves them
5	Love this dress! Fits perfectly and I’ve gotten so many compliments
5	I use this product, along with the shampoo, on my own natural hair and hair extensions.
5	One of my favorite books of all time, and both of my sons', too. Funny, eccentric, suspenseful- it is about the coming end of the world, after all. The characters are quirky and full of life and my favorite character is *ahem* a demon.
5	sounds great. nice addition to my drum percussion
5	Item shipped much faster than expected, in great condition. several reviews say the charger is awkward, and it sort of is, but I'm not bothered by it. The toy is small, great for use with a partner, which is why I chose it. Also comes in a little pink dust pouch, so that makes it easy to store and perfect for travel. I'm most impressed with the company, I left a bad review about some office products I bought that came damaged, and unfortunately mixed it up with the review for this product. The company reached out and offered me a full refund or an exchange - very generous, but alas, it was my mistake, so I instead I am writing the proper review the company and this cute little purple toy deserve.
5	Love it...its hard for me to tan since I'm so fair skinned...I actually get a tan using this
5	The best leash I have ever owned!
5	They are a little loose, but very comfy. Just what I wanted.
5	great in my room. It was amazing colorful lights.
5	Easy to assemble. Very high quality product. EVERYTHING worked fine. I could not be more happy with this product. Will recommend to everyone.
5	I bought this item for my new granddaughter. There are so many choices on the market to choose from it’s hard to pick just one. What sold me on this one is the sensor alarm for when the baby is left in the seat. After hearing and reading all the horror stories out there of babies being left in the car. This eases mind a little more that she will not be forgotten. The stroller is very sturdy, wheels turn with ease.
5	Can’t believe scrunchies are “back In” lol bought these for my niece and she loves them.
5	Bought book marks with out tassels and these will work great!!!!
5	I was unsure what we were going to do on a recent 10 day Hawaii vacation as my daughter had just transitioned out of her crib into a toddler bed. I know a popular option is to have children use guard rails on a second bed, but we did not have that ability in our room. My daughter loved her bed! She was excited at the second resort when we were blowing up the bed. The bed remained firm throughout both stays, and my daughter slept comfortably on the bed for naps and her standard 11/12 hours overnight. I am so thankful we ordered this and brought it with us in our checked luggage!
5	Wanted to monitor humidity in the basement to use our de-humidifier and it's great!
5	At first I thought it was a bit too small but she loved it anyway. I also like that delivery was fast especially since I was working with a limited time frame.
5	The product came on time exactly what was needs. Like
5	Great when worn. I was comfortable instantly when I wore them. After two weeks, it seemed like I had nothing new in my shoe.
5	it hooks up easy with my hero 5 camera.
5	LOVE THEM!! I use the to hang lights on the canopy of our camper.
5	Item shipped fast and as described
5	I tried to call my kids from our kitchen on the 1st floor when they are on the 3rd floors . It sounds very clear and great.Satisfied with the working range .Recommend .
5	Great for walking. A little on the small side but my iPhone XR fits snug and it works. Great magnets.
5	Loved the dark humor. Great job guys.
5	Product works just like new. Great price. What more can you ask for?
5	Great lamp and looks very expensive. Well packaged.
5	Great bag! Fiancé loves it for using at the gym for lifting gear. Small and compact to carry around easily in gym
5	Great power block, I’m able to charge my iPad my iPhone and other things while also being able to change out the outlet adapter so I could take it wherever I travel
5	The Phone that I received in the mail if I had not known seemed brand new right out of the Box runs great looks great
5	The aprons work great. I like the size and the three pocket use.
5	The price for the amount of probiotics in this supplement was most impressive for me.
5	Perfect fit, filters look good. Time will tell how long they'll last.
5	Great book I enjoyed reading can't wait for the next one
5	I bought this to have a second one in my shop. It works great!
5	Not too big, not too small. Use it for my hair.
5	It was a gift for my son and he loved it. The fit was as expected and great quality. Warm and can be worn as dress or casual. Would definitely order again.
5	they fit fine, feel good, and plan to buy more in the future, I have made 2 orders for them at this time
5	Awesome product and worth for money !
5	First for the pros of my product. The respawn 110 is an amazing chair, really comfortable, love the fact it fully reclines with an leg rest, comfortable after hours of gaming, over all great product. Now for the cons of the product. Inconvenient to pull out the leg rest, you cant adjust the arm rest while laying back, needs better lumbar support while sitting in an upright position for a extended period of time. My conclusion of the product is a great buy for any gamer, or just to have as an office chair.
5	Got this for my daughter for our vacation. It held up well...no frizziness, minimal tangling. The color and quality was amazing. Only had to use a little less than 5 packs. There is a nice amount of hair included.. **Update**Purchased again in an other color combination. The hair is gorgeous!! Thank you
5	very positive action easy to install
5	I love this bag, perfect for work and holds more then just my pump. I do wish it would stand up on its own, though.
5	I bought a show curtain rail for my bathroom as it was the only way i could put one up without fixings. As the ends could not came off i had to get something that clipped over with a means of closing off the loop once the hook bit had been inserted into tape.Bingo!!!!Chrome show rings looks good and run smoothly. Good quality and just what i wanted.These gold shower curtain rings are stylish as well as functional.
5	I am a long time Mobil 1 user but switched to this product for my new Jeep because Mobil 1 does not carry a Chrysler oil certification. This Pennzoil product does. That being said, I really like the Pennzoil and will use it in future vehicle even if they aren't from Fiat-Chrysler Corp.
5	Product as described. Good value.
5	I love the Contigo Shake & Go Fit mixer bottle. They hold up very well, and mix shakes *extremely* efficiently. No more gritty leftover powder and no weird texture. Big opening for easy washing.
5	It looks amazing. The children are surprised. I recommended it.
5	My new laptop doesn’t have an RJ-45 port. This solved the problem so I can hook up to an Ethernet connection.
5	They work really well
5	I bought this in a size to fit my thumb and it fits well, stays put, looks good, and spinning the outside ring has become addictive. I like this ring a lot.
5	One of Christmas gifts . Looks very nice!
5	I can't let go of the design and the color of the metal. It looks very high-end! Hold it in the hand is even better! I can easily open a bottle of red wine right now, and I don't have to worry about pulling the plug.
5	We use this in the shower for a second nozzle mount - it’s better then what the mount originally came with.
5	Great lock and fantastic customer service!
5	This is a darker Fey book then most on the market. With a touch of steampunk and one magical story.
5	These are great no-show socks. They stay on my feet nicely. The fit is right and they are super soft & comfy.
5	high quality, easy to install
5	My daughter loves Scooby-Doo doo
5	We always order these trash bags for our salon due to the great price, quantity and quality!
5	My son is really getting a lot from this. He is 7 years old and has been diagnosed with Autism. He doesn't care to color the pictures but he does all the other activities and you can really see it is helping him. Not to mention he is excited about going through the book. For something that has been so hard for him, it is as if he is gaining confidence just from reading and practicing what is in the book.
5	It was an interesting read, how different worldviews clashed. The relationship between two grown siblings that I both liked and truly admired.
5	Everything you could ever need to put in slime. My daughter was able to make tons of different slime. Great purchase, great price.
5	The quality is good and very sturdy so it can shape the body well.Totally worth it
5	Easy install and works great. Installed it several months ago and still no problems. Very nice to let go of the tailgate and not have it slam down!
5	Has provided hours of fun for my grandson!
5	This wall charger is so great.It's a good idea to buy it again.I like it .
5	I use this in conjunction with melatonin. I get a good night's sleep. Better price than direct from Young Living
5	I get great compliment when I wear these
5	I actually really love these microfiber towels. They work wonders when I’m cleaning stainless steel. They also washed well and did not shrink. Super absorbent.
5	Product fits perfectly, easy to use, looks and feels great.
5	Worked as expected I have no complaints. The PLA comes well packed, melts and adheres well to the plate. Will buy again.
5	Very nice looking and sturdy.Very pleased.
5	I bought this rather large bottle of rose scented witch hazel for myself. I was so excited when I got it, because it smelled so much better than just plain boring witch hazel and it had a cool looking bottle. And need I mention, once again, the size... there was so much of it, I knew for sure it would last me forever. *sigh* Apparently my husband loved the smell of it too. He began using it as an added scent in his oil diffusers and putting it in his bath, using it as toner for his face 5 times a day (at least that's what it seemed like to me!) I can't even guess what other ways he must have used it while I wasn't looking. Every day I would stand in the bathroom shocked as I watched my bottle of witch hazel dwindle down to nothing in a matter of 2 weeks... guess next time I'll try the lavendar.
5	My 6mo was able to take a small sip while playing with it. Great training cup to start with.
5	This is the first book I have read in this series by these Authors and I find the story great. I enjoyed the. Book from beginning to end.....
5	issues getting it to stick. will figure it out
5	I'm happy with it. It was a bit loud the first day or so but after the bio film, or whatever it is, coated things, its quiet and works just like OEM. Happy to have spent the money on this instead of a new filter.
5	Taste is great. Easy to blend in coffee.
5	Got lasik surgery a couple of weeks ago and all of my glasses had UV blocking. Had purchased another pair of these at another place and they were way more expensive and not as cute. Returned the other pair and am sticking with these. They are light weight, stylish, affordable, and do their job.
5	My son wear a 10 in men so I always go a half size Bigger with all his shoes / sneakers to give him room for growth. He wore these shoes for his 8th grade dance. He didn't complain about the fit at all. And they were on their his feet all night .
5	My husband loved these! Great value for the price! Came with a cute little bag for the rings too.
5	Its perfect thank you
5	Those headphones are light, comfortable and convenient. I use them to listen the music while working. I am very satisfied with the volume and tone quality.
5	I was looking for a case that would be thinner and lighter than the one I had for my last iPad. This one fit the bill. Was delivered a day early, and the quality was just as advertised. Well worth the cost of admission. 5 stars for both the quality and the quick delivery.
5	I have been using this often, and it works well. Cuts fast and pretty cleanly.
5	They work great. I'm hard on my cords but these have lasted.
5	These were great. Made to come apart and wash up. The move across the hard wood floor fast. Easy for our toddler to play with
5	Great item for my reading and my granddaughter just love it for her coloring books and sitting on the couch or her chair.
5	Very nice and bright color, very firm and sturdy, easy to travel with. It has everything going for it.
5	I am happy with my purchase, I needed a lunchbox for my son and couldn't find anything that wasn't "girly" in the store. I have used the Packit brand for the past 5 years for my daughter so I knew what I wanted for my son.
5	It is made well. Comes in two items. Excellent quality!
5	At first, I was skeptical, but it actually worked. I bought it and got the code immediately in my order product detail.
5	The Vic Firth stick holder is very well made. It's not going to fall apart any time soon. it also fit my drum rack. The only downside is its capacity is two pair of sticks, if you consider that a downside. overall, this is a well constructed stick holder that will last you a long time.
5	When you receive this item you are going to be amazed at how much you are getting for the money. Mores than worth the purchase and a good way to get organized.
5	Mobile phone bracket is fashionable and elegant in appearance and fine in manufacturing process. Its material is very good. It has no irritating taste. It is very easy to install. It will not block my sight when placed on the car. It is a very practical mobile phone bracket.
5	Just a few drops of this product definitely makes a big difference. I've noticed changes in my body and i lose a few pounds already. I'am so happy and excited for more positive result in the future.
5	Great price. Fast shipping. Works great.
5	I love the fact that the pacifier is attached to the little stuffed animal I gives baby something small to cuddle with.
5	I love the flexfit band, and was glad to find these!
5	I love this water bottle and never leave home without it. The size and shape are perfect, as is the opening which is easy to sip from. I drink from it sideways so the lid isn't in my face lol. It doesn't drip or leak and the locking feature works great. I have been putting it in my briefcase with my laptop for the last month without incident. I also like the one-touch button to open the lid (when it's unlocked). It's a big bottle, so of course it's much heavier than a plastic bottle. A hidden benefit is the handle on the back: it allows you to lay the bottle on its side without rolling around. Since it's so tall, this has been great for keeping it on my bedside table. Don't have to worry about knocking over a huge glass bottle in the middle of the night. It's easy to clean, and I like that no plastic comes into contact with the water. I have loved my Takeya water bottle forever but finally needed a replacement and they don't make the same one anymore. This one is even better, I'm glad I got it.
5	These glasses bring me such joy they work great and everyone loves to see them always getting smiles my way!!!
5	Loved it! A new twist to supernatural novels.
5	Very sturdy! I was so surprised at the high quality of these. They don’t wobble, slip, or bend.
5	Beautiful design. Came early.
5	can only use one at a time
5	Was nervous this product would be difficult to use or cause irritation, but it's only made me love my eyebrows. I use it every 3 weeks or so, and it makes me look more awake and put together even without makeup. Love it!
5	Super bright! It is a very handy lantern for camping and using around the house for lighting darkened spaces.
5	Simple to use. Fairly accurate especially considering the low price. Even includes extra batteries. A lot of functionality in one small device.
5	Daughter loves it for marking her space while reading !!
5	This item is even better looking in person than in the pics. This works great in my desk and has added a level of organization to my desk that I needed. It is even better that it look great in my desk as well.
5	My daughter loved this outfit it was comfortable and she could still play and run in it!
5	I got this shirt for my 8 year old. He loves it! I'm pretty fond of it too. The shirt is good quality material and the printing is spot on. The medium is a little big for my lean 8 year old but the length is perfect. 1 wash/dry in there is no change in shape or size of the shirt. 5 stars for sure!
5	Love these! They really add to my workout and challenge new muscles.
5	I ordered a pound just to try them, and when they arrived, they were nice and soft, and bursting with flavor. I liked them so much, I ordered again but this time got the three pound size. They come in a zip type foil bag so there's no need to repackage when they arrive. Highly recommended.
5	I like this cooler purse I used it for a day trip to zoo.
5	It gets in those small spaces
5	A simple book and it works! I bought it when my toddler was 2.5 yo, after visiting a friend's home and he didn't understand why he couldn't have my friend's breastmilk. After reading this book a few times, he got it. It explains a simple message, if it's not your mama then her milk is not for you. He understood right away why couldn't he have another human mama or animal mama's milk.
5	I am on my second bottle and I’m seeing great results. I have tried several different probiotics with no results until I tried Balance one.. I would highly recommended this probiotic.
5	I bought these to use around the house instead of carpet slippers as they were making my feet sweat, and after being in work boots all day a bit of fresh air would not go a miss.
5	Nice fit. Very comfortable.
5	Very clear stylish lenses that help greatly in reducing light glare at night.
5	This is the most comfortable article of clothing I own!!! I get so many compliments when I wear it 😊
5	I was always losing my glasses in the house. This is a cute and funny way to always know where my glasses are.
5	This seems to work very well. It brought down swelling on my wife's calf and ankle within hours. We particularly like that the sock covers most of the foot -- which many similar products do not -- because we needed this because of foot surgery. To the reviewers of many similar products who note that the zippers don't stay up: Try turning down the top inch or so of the stocking. That keeps the zipper in place.
5	Easy and lot of fun..
5	I never by clothes online because I’m scared that I won’t like them. I’m glad I took a risk on this one! Super comfy, not see through, fits as expected.
5	As advertised! Worked great in my cricket maker.
5	This would make a great gift for your tea loving friends. Great taste! Also good packaging!
5	I like how they work! Glad I chose this product. Thank you!
5	LIKE I SAID IT SQUEEZES FOR GOOD EXCERCISE COMFORTABLE TO HOLD-- NOT TO BIG AND NOT TO SMALL--NOT TO SOFT --NOT TO HARD. I WOULD PURCHASE ANOTHER.
5	Great case for my 7 year old boys IPhone. Have been on for a couple weeks now and not having any issues with. Has helps up to a mountian camping vacation so far.
5	Loved how. Many different patterns the lights have
5	Solid product. Have been using J-Tech stuff for years. Had a receiver fail from a previous generation of the product and was assured that this new generation would be compatible. 100% correct! Thanks J-Tech.
5	Quality knife all around !!!
5	Bought these for my gentleman friend for Valentine's Day and he absolutely loved them. It's days later and he keeps talking about them. I wanted to find a way to express how much of a strong King I think he is and these did the trick! Great quality and reasonably priced. Will order more in the future.
5	Cheaper than the pharmacy. 100% recommended.
5	Great item! Keeps odors in and material feels great and light.
5	As advertised excellent product and fast shipping
5	It is great for my room because it is big
5	Little flimsy but works great!
5	Good..............................................
5	Exactly as ordered. Quick delivery. Perfect fit and good quality!
5	Great spotting scope for the price. Works very well
5	It was exactly what was needed for my daughter and her laptop and it was exactly on time.
5	Stylish and a life changer for my work station
5	I started taking this last year. I felt better pretty quickly. My mood improved, my energy improved, I was able to lose weight (finally). I had ran out and hadn’t ordered more. Here I am a year later, 20 lbs heavier, moody, tired and fatigued again. The only difference between then and now is I wasn’t taking this. I ordered a bottle and started taking it again. I suffer from hypothyroidism and also had a hysterectomy
5	This blanket is extremely soft and comfy
5	Absolutely love it! Bought it for a friend and now I am thinking about buying one for myself!
5	Great product for the price. Fits perfectly and each brush comes with a hard plastic cover. Included are also a couple of color rings in case you have few family members with the same brush.
5	Smaller then expected but love it!
5	Great looking Large clock.
5	Lightbulbs worked exactly as advertised. Very happy with my purchase. I have had them installed now for a couple of months now without any issues. Definitely recommend for under-cabinet lighting
5	This was her first toy and probably still her favorite. I used the heartbeat the first week and haven't used it since. She loves to play and wrestle with it now. I liked that she had the heat insert and heartbeat when she first came home to help her get comfortable in her new home. She's pretty rough and this is still in one piece!
5	Love anklets! These are perfect!
5	Comes with an extra in case you goof. This is a three beer project not to be rushed. Mark old decal position with tape so you get them on even. Stickers are factory quality.
5	Reminds me of maple syrup in some strange way - but I love this in my drinks! Of course, you only use a drizzle - but I cannot wait to use it in other dishes!!
5	It's been a few weeks and I think it's working I feel better so about a month I'll write another review
5	I go to the pool a lot so I keep my phone in them. I also use it under water when I snorkel.
5	I bought these to use at Thanksgiving. I am so happy with the color and Quality!!
5	Ordered two because I had two previously but one got lost. Really nice to use for oranges for a household of 9.
5	Super awesome product. Not allergic to this sunblock and am very happy.
5	Is a very well stocked kit The entire kit will serve all my needs
5	These plate covers are nice. Was super easy to install. I would definitely buy again
5	As a beginner in playing the violin, this is what I needed.
5	Trimmed down to fit my table. Helped transform the room for my daughter's fairy themed party.
5	Used these name badges for a meeting. It was very helpful to have the attendees with a name tag.
5	This has become my new every day belt. It is extremely comfortable due to how adjustable it is, and it actually supports the weight of my sidearm and holster without sagging.
5	Overall, a great case. I've only used it for one day, but it seems like a tight fit. Most importantly, it's slim enough to fit well in my pocket, but the outside edge seems thick enough to provide great protection if (when) I drop it. Would recommend purchasing.
5	This stopped my daughters jeep bright lights from flickering!
5	My son had a good time snorkeling with this. It did not fog up on his which I read was a concern in relation to Co2.
5	Love this mattress. I did a lot of research before purchasing and really wanted an Avocado Green mattress but it was just a little too expensive so bought this instead. This mattress is a great value and so comfortable. It did take a night or two to get used to the feel but after that were couldn't be happier!
5	Exactly what I needed. Great product. Great price and very fast shipping!
5	Exactly what I was looking for. The pictures are large and clear. The book is solid enough to stand up on its own so I can prop it up for baby to see during tummy time.
5	Excited I got this Superman is boss!
5	Bought these two shears for my kids to use for cutting the bushes beside the swimming pool. Both of them work great and they are easy to hold for smaller hands. Great for kids to help on backyard work. Happy with this purchase.
5	Easy to set up and ready for use. I like the thin design of the product and the ease of adding 128g card.
5	I like this car seat...its light weight
5	Amazing summer album with sounds and lyrics that take you back to the 80s and 90s. Outstanding job Ben! Keep them coming!
5	Nice, clean looking Bamboo Jar. The top swivels to open and it is held closed by a tiny magnet. Works perfectly for keeping my Himalayan salt.
5	This french press is amazing! Great price! Great quality! Very easy to use! Bought for small apartment space living and it's amazing!
5	These are great towels. They absorb a lot of water and make it easier and faster to dry your hair.
5	I cannot imagine what it would be like to have a childhood like this. I love the PBS tv show but our the book is different and it follows Gerry more than the family. Some great laugh out loud parts and some sad parts, but all in all an enjoyable read.
5	I love this Kors wristlet. The phone slot is big enough to leave my otter box on my Samsung. Perfectly fits necessities for easy going out wallet.
5	I use it before and after hiking and find that I have more energy for the hike and recover more quickly.
5	Used this for a party decoration and worked great
5	I ride 15-25 miles 3-4 times a week and this helps dramatically with being able to see the progress on my phone to better my times and distance. No complaints so far with 4 rides using the holder. I have an iPhone 8+ and it works great.
5	My daughter love it thank you .
5	Loved the small container to travel with.
5	Terrific price well under cost of similar/ same quality at big box stores.
5	This is a solid and good rack. I purchased the wrong one though and the 2 forward arms to the rear light post do not reach. It's been a big problem. Still working on a solution. May just buy the right one as the price is so good and use this one on another bike.
5	I recommend this product
5	Over the years I've used the Dillon one as well as Lyman (which is same as RCBS) and the Hornady media separator is hands down the best of them all. It's appears to be made of high quality polycarbonate and not the usual cheap/soft injection moulding plastic. The parts fit and lock into position without any latches/snaps that can (and do) break. Last but not least, it's compact and thus easy to use in a utility sink or a bathtub. They even include a mesh screen that slips over one of the baskets and thus allows you to strain & retrieve all your stainless steel pins easily. Hornady really thought this through and built a quality product, so if you're wet tumbling, this is definitely the media separator to get.
5	This product cleans the nose very well. The suction is strong yet gentle on skin. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has blackhead issues. Good for both men and women.
5	Nice look and feel. Cuts clean through ribs or brisket.
5	I love the watch band. It is comfortable to wear and easy to adjust. Great product. I did not use the screen protector because I already have a Bodyguardz.
5	Hung two of these in my closet. The shelf width is perfect for storing CDs, arts and crafts items, books, etc. Easy to put together; looks very nice.
5	I absolutely adore this light, and I’ve received LOADS of compliments. It took me about 1 hour to put together- so nothing crazy there. My boyfriend installed a dimmer which works beautifully as well. I love this fixture.
5	Works great has a nice amount of space before it triggers
5	My wife was very pleased when these arrived. Apparently they are even prettier IRL than in pictures.
5	I finally received my product. The seller was remorseful and gave me a partial refund. I don’t know what exactly happened enroute to the shipment but they have been extremely kind to me. If I need another product I’ll get it from them if if it’s available.
5	One of my all time favorites. Very easy to refill soap dispensers and smells phenominal.
5	Best Bluetooth there is. Also, the retro look and feel of a real Marshall amp makes this an amazing piece. Love it.
5	Cute little kit and the carrying pouch is nice. Bought for my best friend. We used YouTube to pull a video on how to repair her iphone screen. Since it was our first time, it probably took a bit longer than someone who isn't quite as meticulous but we were able to replace her phone screen just fine, saving her money in the process since we didn't have to go to a mall kiosk. If you have a habit of damaging your iphone screen, this should be a must-have for you. I need one for my Samsung!
5	Lots of items and options for the price, seems to work well.
5	Good very good! I like it very much!
5	Got my favorite Christmas light. Give it a try earlier which is really impressive. It’s works wonderful . Can’t wait for Christmas come.
5	My daughter-in-law told me about this product she said it was good and she was right
5	Been through a few and this is the best one yet. Feels like high quality but I fear to drop it.
5	exactly as described
5	I needed a nice winter top for just hanging out on vacation. It is perfect, thick and warm. It was great for 40 degree weather of course with a jacket. A good buy.
5	My TV is an older model that still works great. I lost the remote during a move. This replacement worked as soon as I took it out of the package.
5	Love these purse hook! Pretty look and very convenient for ladies room and restaurant, don't need to worry purse bottom dirty anymore, bags would be stolen when hanging on the chairs back, but this fix that, I can have my purse beside me. Also I used this at work just free up lots of space, it seems very strong and good made. Will purchase more as gift for friends and relatives.
5	works just as expected.
5	We absolutely love this French press, its easy to use, great quality and its a great size for two people. Works great for both hot and cold brew. Excellent product.
5	I bought two of these for my husband and daughter who drop their tablets quite often. They have not broken yet after 6 months.
5	This is a great leash. I've tried others, but this one has been the most durable. I have a 65lb mixed terrier dog who is quite strong. The padded handle makes our walks more comfortable for me, especially when he gets excited and decides to pull! The pattern of silver threading on the leash reflects light at night, which I really appreciate.
5	I am a senior and don't get the exercise I know I need. This has helped me so much with the circulation in my legs and given me muscle that I haven't had in years. I love it because I can sit in front of the tv or while on my computer. I usually use about 30 min every time and I love it.
5	Feels great. My dad loved it.
5	Great quality Amazing features Returned because too big for daughter
5	I'm a truck driver & this does way better than the ones that are actually for a truck...for 75% less in price!
5	We’ve had this heater in out small fish pond for over 2 months. We have had several below freezing nights and days. The heater has kept a small area free from ice.
5	These are fantastic and my dog loves them!
5	Husband was very happy
5	Amazing ! Doesn’t feel like too much pressure. Just the right amount .
5	A key on my laptop keyboard was no longer functional and after trying (and failing) to get it to work, I decided to get a wireless keyboard to use with it while at my desk. Of course, not a long term solution but a necessary and immediate one. This keyboard is great. It connects very quickly to my computer, stays charged for days of full use, and is small, lightweight, but also the size of a standard keyboard for a 15" laptop. It seems well made, is reasonably stylish, and holds up to me transporting it to and from my office daily. For the price, you can't beat this keyboard!
5	This is a must have for my yellow lab. We buy one every year or so because we wear it out! The product is well built, it just gets over used. Eventually the giant rubberband wears out. Recommend for any dog who loves to chase balls!
5	Love them! Cuter in person than the picture! Fits well, the feet and mittens are perfect, and the fabric feels wonderful!
5	I used the product for smelly garbage disposal and a slow bathroom drain. It worked .
5	So pretty. Big and good quality tea towel. The kind I like for drying glasses.
5	Very soft and comfortable very light weight and cute
5	I can't wait to put together a Fairy garden with my purchase. I'm busy with the holidays now and am unable to do so, but soon . . .
5	I love this lamp so much, I bought 2! Put the right kind of bulb in and these babies shine! All the hardware was included to hang it easily. Going to Lowes and Home Depot, I just didn't see too many lights like this that I thought would be worth trying. Definitely recommend these! My house doesn't have any ceiling lights in the living room, now it has 2!
5	Love this shirt! Wish it came in other colors, I would get more colors. I liked it so much that I bought 2 more to gift out. It’s so soft and comfortable, I love wearing it. Thank you for a great product! And I love the fact that it’s made from coffee!
5	absolutely love these storage containers These are really great for storing food in your pantry. This product was exactly what is was looking for to get my pantry organized. They look so neat and organized in my cabinets. A lot more convenient than the competitions. I would like to add that the customer service for the company is great as well.
5	Perfect size for my butts. I don't have to fight with placing it into the snuffer. I love that they are easy to clean too! Will be ordering more and giving them to my family and friends who need them! I hate burning filters!
5	We use these soft paper towels in the place of large kleenex.
5	granddaughter loves it. catches her attention. (5 months old)
5	Wowww!!! My best friend complained a lot about the fact that she cant sleep next to her husband cause of his snoring and their relationship begun to be very sad. I persuaded him to purchase vents, he agreed because he really love her. Today she is the happiest person in the world! Recommended.
5	Bought this salt for our 20 gallon fiddler crab tank and it works perfectly. It is maybe not the most cost effective salt additive; you can buy marine salt for cheaper. Folks seem confused about aquarium salt. API aquarium salt is NOT for brackish/saltwater tanks. It does not supply the necessary nutrients, minerals, etc. THIS brackish salt can be used for brackish or saltwater setups, although, as stated previously, not likely the most inexpensive option if you have a larger tank.
5	Was given as a gift to my father in law he love his hat he wears it all the time.
5	There’s absolutely no tugging on my facial hair! I get a better shave with this than more expensive razors I’ve used!
5	This is a great little scale. I really like the case, which doubles as a weighing tray for small parts. The piece count feature, allowing you to weigh ten items, like a screws, then put a large number in and count them works like a champ, left me with grins all over.
5	Just finished it! Loved it!
5	Went to You Tube and found how to install the release. Job took me about 15 min.
5	Love the storage case worked out well for what I needed
5	Its a nice guitar, light yet big enough
5	The container has a good seal and rolls easily. Arrived prompt and would purchase again.
5	Small but powerful. I was pleasantly surprised to see this heater provide heat for my office space. Its adjustable thermostat works perfect and its amazing how quickly it heats up. This space heater warmed everyone next to me and myself all day. I highly recommend for everyone.
5	Great product and great small I wish it last longer
5	This is s great alternative to pills it takes a bit to work at its best but it works i can actually 💤
5	Fairly easy to install. Is very bright and work great with all weather
5	Colors are vibrant and perfect for our Kate Spade themed party!
5	I purchased this tool box because I needed a tool box for my home. The tools are sturdy and it's one of the few that had the correct bit I needed for my car. I was able to use these tools for my car and house, I really like this tool set
5	Sauce is perfect,a flavor I had been looking for ever,it arrived quick,there is nothing I didn't like about this Item.very pleased,thank you
5	I was very happy with the quality of this. Awesome looking and great quality. Great buy for their cost. I recommend this item.
5	Love it. Perfect birthday present and Valentine's present for my mom
5	Gift for husband - knew he would love it
5	Perfect for organizing all of your small desk supplies.
5	Very comfortable. Room darkened very well
5	It worked!! But the smell was kind of strong.
5	I like the fact that it is a hard cover copy and it have a lot more prayers than the soft copy. It is a very good prayer book. The prayers are in the bible and you can pray these prayers to protect yourself, your friends and your family members.
5	It took a little bit to get it adjusted so that it would move when I took the seatbelt off. It's nicer than I expected for the price.
5	Great Product for the price!
5	Replacement for old Phillips. Great product, enjoy using it. I find the battery life can be a little short, but I brush 3 times a day, so you be the judge.
5	I bought this after finding out via candid camera that I do indeed snore in my sleep. Apparently loud enough to wake my children down the hall. I was hesitant at first because it does look a bit odd but I must say I was surprised at how comfortable and effective it is. I haven’t snored since I started using the mask!
5	Love this movie kept me on the edge of my seat at all times
5	I love the cool, soothing feel of this moisturizer. I ordered exactly what the Olay website beauty tool suggested and I feel it is working as described.
5	Ive ran 'em for almost 2 years and finally made a review. They're still working great. No suspension parts have needed replaced, and they give good stance. Ove posted some before and after pics with this.
5	I was tired of paying $7 PER knife for sharpening. I got the LINKYO Electric Knife Sharpening and within the hour ALL the knives in my kitchen where sharp and ready to get to work. I'll never have to deal with a dull knife again!
5	Great to help with liver. Easy to swallow
5	This product is more beautiful than it looks on line. I Bought it to put on my bed and it looks beautiful!
5	Nice color. My cabinet looks like new.
5	Only had them for a couple of weeks but for the price they are awesome. One of them is a little too big but I can remedy it pretty easy. Would give 4.5 but not an option.
5	Great for holding my iPad as a music stand. Very sturdy and stays in place.
5	Had surgery recently and I learned some of the PT exercises. It meets the same standards as the ones provided at the gym.
5	Very study feeling doesn't feel cheap. Works great.
5	Great price and just what I needed for my garage!!
5	I absolutely fell on love with the characters and how Rachel wove the storyline together. So many life lessons in this book!
5	The real deal, I always have a spare in the garage. The most common item in a house AC to go.
5	I have been struggling with lack of energy and weight gain since having a partial thyroidectomy 2 years ago. I am on a super low dose of levothyroxine and my blood work always comes back normal even though I still struggle with symptoms. thyroid support has changed my life. In one month of taking feel so much better- more energy and motivation to work out again.
5	Headphones fit very comfortably even while wearing glasses and noise cancellation is superb.
5	Found by accident and so glad we did, was so much more enjoyable then we even thought it would be. Fast delivery!
5	Soon received Nice power cords. Very well made, strong cords. A great replacement for apple cords that fall apart at the connection between the cord and the tip. Easy to use. Great replacement cable at good price If I need them again, I will definitely buy from the same company. Good product. I want to take the company and work with my colleagues These things are tough and well made
5	Super soft sheets! They were great and just what I was looking for! They are light weight and soft.
5	They fit me well and are very comfortable.
5	Classy... easy to size.. you can wear it with jeans or out on the town it is a basic piece in my professional jewelry as well!!
5	I loved it! Thank's Recommended
5	I love the taste of the coffee. I purchased it when I was away at a friends house in Florida. He didn't drink coffee so I ran to the organic market, they had this I figured why not try it. I was pleasantly surprised. Now I keep it in my overnight bag and drink it pretty much every morning. A lot easier than taking out my perk pot.
5	My grandson loved it Sized perfectly.
5	These are great. Got them for Valentine goodie bags and have so many left over i could keep using for other events like birthdays and easter.
5	For a similar price to mid-tier adhesive bras, theses babies provide a reasonable coverage and a modest lift (they hold your breast closer together). They're comfy to wear and are quite gentle when you're ready to take them off. I like that they taper outwards, similar to a bra. Hopefully it lasts awhile, will update if anything changes. One concern I have is how long the plastic clasp will last, but overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase and find it to be a good value.
5	Work very well. Very happy. Just make sure you don't go too far on the last step creates a little too much tension and caused headaches. But once I heated it up and reformed it was just fine. Very happy.
5	Easy to use and comes with built in battery. Gives a accurate reading of any tire.
5	This is my 2nd one the 1st lasted 3 years easy to fill with filtered water from refrigerator.
5	It's professional and huge but folds away into less than the size of a book!
5	I use this every night and sleep so much better without ambient night light from all the electronics in the bedroom and the street lights. Best part is, there's no velcro to scratch my bald head.
5	Just received my hair combed and I have to say that my expectations were high and I have to say they were met! This comb works like a charm thank you for creating this!
5	Great Slime Kit, my daughter loved this!
5	Covers fit well on my Garmin 520. Buttons all operate smoothly. Nice item.
5	I guess it would work but I lost it. Its so small. It arrived quickly and I might find it soon if my dog didn't eat it.
5	Very nice product, worth for money
5	The finish is great thread on perfectly and contrast very well to my truck. The price is right too, can't beat that
5	Good quality. Just hard to find a bra that works with it. Probably need to go with a strapless one.
5	I was looking fo a new carryon with.a trolley sleeve, because for those who are familiar with multiple legs of travel, running for a train with multiple bags is difficult to maneuver. My criteria was it had to have a trolley sleeve, be stylish and versatile enough to bring to the beach, roomy enough to fit my travel pillow, accessories, food and change of clothes, and zippered so my stuff doesn’t fall out. This met all the criteria and I also loved that it has a flat bottom and is easy to clean, because I will be stowing this under the seat in front of me and we all know how disgustingly dirty planes are. The trolley sleeve keeps the bag together with the main bag more securely, so I can’t wait to try this out. Some reviews have said it doesn’t fit over the handle, but this is not a problem with my Eagle Creek roller bag. The only thing I think I would change are the handles, because they are kind of thin and may hurt if carrying heavier stuff as a tote, but I can deal with it and my solution would be to slip on some padded sleeves on the handle.
5	Reading this I can understand why so many courses start with vocabulary, its so important. Using this with my grammar book is starting to make Thai click for me.
5	Bought three, two as gifts and one for myself. Well packaged on arrival. Very pleased with this product.
5	My 7-year old loved this story. Introducing children to disability at an early age is a great thing we can give our children.
5	This EP has 5 of the most aesthetically pleasing music I have ever heard from the Foo Fighters, in my personal opinion of course. A definate must have for all Foo Fighter fans and a great album for anyone new to the band's sound.
5	Just what I was looking for!
5	I wanted a space-conscious shelf to display my growing amiibo collection and this works really well for it. I’d say it holds 9 comfortably.
5	Good Product fits well
5	Perfect and great price!
5	It works and looks great. :)
5	Super cute and come packaged really nicely
5	Amazing products!!! The bristles on the brush are very soft. Great packing! I love that everything is natural and there are no harmful chemicals used. Fast shipping and delivery. I will definitely recommend these products to friends and family. Will buy again as a gift to all my friends that are expecting or have little ones. :)
5	Love it and fits as it should be!
5	This book came in really well and the material is is awesome this book is awesome I can’t wait to read it it’s amazing you should really really buy this
5	High quality, I like them alot.
5	Applied to Samsung Now 8 and right side of the screen (edge) does not respond very well to fiber touch. It does respond the way it should when the pen is used.
5	got this to cut yard sticks to make a frame for my daughters first day of school chalkboard sign! exceeded expectations and made the job so much easier!!
5	This product worked great...have using it to project MAC computers to a HDMI TV and it has not had any problems.
5	Prompt shipping, excellent packaging. Thank you for your neat product (Edison light bulbs) and fine service.
5	It’s Exactly what I ordered and Works Great!! Thank You
5	This made it super easy for my toddler to get up and down!
5	The swivel mounted ear cups provide a nice fit for full ear coverage for clear quality sound. Being a glasses wearer, I found that I had no pain at the back of my ears where my glasses set. Meaning, the headphones don’t apply to much pressure. When I have it connected to my cell phone, there is a simple one push button process to take and end a call and I can control the volume through the phone or the headphones themselves. The headband is soft and flexible which remains comfortable after long periods of use. I use my headphones a lot when listening to audio books and find the sound quality is just as clear when hearing the narrator speak as when listening to music. Crisp and crystal clear. It came with a nice bag for storing it when not in use, as well as the necessary charging and audio cables. Very satisfied with this purchase of these Ghostek Bluetooth headphones.
5	Finally, it's happening, kingdom hearts 3! I'm happy the game came in with no problems. Thank you for a great buy!
5	Sound amazing! Seem to last longer due to the nano coating.
5	very easy to use , seems to be reliable , the instructions say to let it cool between use which I have been doing and all is ok , and you can reseal stuff ie multi packs of nam bread , very usefull tool
5	These are great fitting, very comfortable shoes. I've gotten several compliments on them. Love, love, love them!
5	Very nice and best price of other options
5	They worked perfectly
5	My daughter bought this for her art project. So the size wasnt important but i would say this is meant for kids under 8
5	This was exactly what I needed. It arrived fast.
5	I was having leg cramps at night that were seriously depriving me of sleep. I figured my mag levels were low, but just a few days after starting this, they were gone! I take it late in the evening, very relaxing!
5	These are perfect! Now that the weather is warm, my daughter needed extra padding so the straps didn’t leave marks on her shoulder/neck. A lot of reviewers complained that they were thin but that’s what I like about them. They won’t be too hot on her skin.
5	Used it in birdbath to keep water from being stagnant- put it in my dog’s swimming pool - it’s fun to watch and turns off when water dries out. I recommend this!
5	These seem just as good as BIC. I love these.
5	As expected. Works OK.
5	Could not tell from new and the battery lasts for days
5	I use mine to function like a wine rack and I keep it with the top open. I think its a great, unique way to store your wine or just as a decorative piece.
5	This is so great! Supreme quality, sooo cute, and my daughter loves it.
5	They arrived way sooner than expected. ALL packaged so wonderfully! All products should have this quality of packaging! Also all creamy! I love in Cleveland Ohio... which is sooo dang cold during winter!
5	Nice fish finder just wish it was a little bigger
5	Ever since Starbucks weaned America's appetite for good coffee with a horrendous burnt grind, I went from 6-10 cups a day down to one or two (and I didn't enjoy it). I started drinking expresso (believe it or not, Dunkin Donuts have the best expresso .. better than Starbucks). I looked at the recipes for KETO coffee ... expensive ... messy ... way too much work. I purchased this, heated my coffee in the microwave and believe it or not, this isn't bad (Better than many take out coffee places). And if you're trying Keto, you don't have to buy 3 products (and btw, this is much less expensive).
5	It’s hard to find great tasting peanuts that aren’t burned these are consistent and delicious
5	This pint glass was exactly what I was looking for for my brother’s 60th birthday party at a brewery! Very nice quality and arrived without a scratch
5	This item was cute. It did just what I wanted it to do. I wanted too be able to make zucchini noodles and it did it beautifully!
5	These clean up your closet so easily it's silly. I can finally find all my pants, all my skirts, and all my hard to hang up tops and my closet looks great.
5	Great, comfy, no padding but still great lift, keeps everything in place, easy on/off. Bought another one right away! I am a 34DD in bras so I bought this in 36DD for some give, and it was perfect. I am also very short so need a lot of tightness in the shoulders and they adjust far enough to stay put.
5	Bought for a friend who gets bad migraines. She says it Greatly helps her.
5	Looks fabulous on my cake. So worth the money.
5	Love this product, it is the only dry shampoo I will use. Smells great and does not leave my hair feeling heavy or leaves any white residue.
5	Excellent quality, super durable and nice compact size. This was exactly what I was looking for and will most likely buy a second one for my home office.
5	My son loves this. He’s 29 and immediately put it on and fired it up. Great gift!
5	This thing is suuuuper high quality for the price. The outer canvas and the inner material (luxurious af) feel pretty durable. It's a little smaller than a regular school backpack, but still perfect size to fit a 13" MacBook Pro, spiral notebooks, standard folders, iPad, all the normal stuff. The belt things on the front look cool and pop open with magnetic rivets so you don't have to deal with belt buckle nonsense. Lots of pockets of various sizes, AND THE CUPHOLDER. Lemme tell ya, the cupholder thing on the side is a nice thick elastic mesh that holds any regular water bottle snug. Dank bag, buy it.
5	These ski straps are working really well so far and they feel durable and look pretty good too. Even though I’ve used ski straps before, most didn’t have a section to carry my skis and were too small to fit both skis and poles. The thing I like about this one is that it has a section for the skis and another section for the poles. All in all pretty pleased with this!
5	I love this color and softness. Couldn't find them available in the stores but I can count on Amazon every time
5	Yes, served my purpose. Would recommend to everyone. Ideal for traveling, or home.
5	This case is very slim, fits the phone perfectly!
5	I love how this shirt feels. I just wish it was pleated in the front.
5	Durable and comfortable. My 2nd pair. Dog chewed up 1st pair.
5	Fantastic jacket! Looks exactly like the picture and fits true to size. It arrived on time too!
5	Great product!!! Very happy with how well it works!
5	Stayed on for 2 weeks. No chipping. Ordering more
5	Good quality connectors. Ordered three 2-packs to connect 12 lights in my garage. 1 of the 6 connectors was faulty out of the box, but the seller was helpful in sending a replacement. New one works fine, so all is well, and I'd recommend these.
5	It is an amazing idea for those who wants to replace plastic straws for something reusable. I bring it with me every time I go out so I don’t need to get plastic straws anymore.
5	I really like the scanner, I just say no problem I have a scanner ,it is as fast as you would like, for research and to get a copy of something its been good especailly for the price, its lightweight fits in my purse .
5	This dress fits perfectly!
5	Love these! Soft and stay where you want the to throughout the day
5	Worked well. It was a very needed item.
5	Good product for a good price; I really liked the 2-pack.
5	Easy and comfortable to use. Nice as a gift as it comes with two piece. One for yourself, one for your love.
5	Tried a different kind of magnetic lashes with two magnets and like the 3 much better like these have. Very natural looking and easy to put on. Curl your top lashes, put on, and add mascara to bottom lashes. I wear these on a regular basis! Very easy to use with practice. Cover any drain if you put on over a sink- I lost a piece that way. Worn many times and friends ask me how my lashes grew out- you cannot see the magnet unless you know what you’re looking for- fits seemlessly on the lash line.
5	Bought a size 12 because that's what my 15yo wears for shoes but it was just a tad big so I returned it and got one size smaller.
5	This is a great little shower speaker. I use it every morning and usually charge it what seems like once every few weeks or so. I've had one for over a year now and it's starting to not last as long but that is to be expected and at the small price tag i will just eventually buy another one. It's also very portable and have taken it with me on trips as well.
5	Delivered when told it would be to my mom whom I ordered it for. She used it as an essential oil mix for pain.
5	When I want just one more cup of joe, this fits the bill. Grind a few beans, put a #2 filter in, heat water on the stove and pour. The only tricky thing is to know how much water you actually need so it doesn't over run the mug. Pro tip, only heat one mug worth of water...
5	I’ve only had it a short time, so far it is working great. Easy to assemble fits great.
5	Used these for the tops of cupcakes they looks cute!
5	Only used for one day so far, but met expectations. Very soft and light which is what I wanted. Will use for sailing and motorcycle riding this summer to protect from sun. Will hang dry as I expect pilling would happen in dryer given material composition.
5	A very good looking shell necklace. I like the design so much as well as the material.
5	Product was delivered to neighbors house ... thankfully they did not take my products
5	Works perfectly with Wink hub 2
5	My girl loves this movie. Good buy.
5	A much different story than book 1 but an incredible expansion of the universe created in that book. Highly recommended
5	Beautiful to see at night
5	Smooth, smells great, and works well. Good stuff!
5	I accidentally burnt my mums lulu shirt and was desperate to find a replacement because it was her favourite. Was surprised to find this, took a chance and ordered it because it looks almost identical to the one she had and she LOVES it! The material is so soft and comfy she says so I’m thrilled. Thank you!
5	Hooked from book one!
5	These are very cute I can’t wait to use them for baby girl!
5	If you're skeptical because of the price, don't be this thing is awesome. Burned through 8 boards at half inch really quick, no more jigsaw.
5	This fitted leatherette Pool Table cover fits my pool table perfect. Looks nice and heavy duty. Love it.
5	These are the best over the counter readers I have ever bought, and believe me I've bought a "few" Stylish, durable with spring action at a very reasonable $$. HIGHLY recommend!
5	Perfect to the picture.
5	I was searching and searching for something large enough to hold all of my many MUST HAVE utensils. This was it. It's durable, easy to clean, and large. The price was right and I'm very pleased with this purchase. If you have lots of tools of the trade grab you one of these.
5	Have not tried it yet but will do so soon got in time and happy with it thank you
5	The travel wallet easily carried my passport, as well as, credit card and cash. Access to each item was easy. although it is lightweight, I personally have a hard time with weight around my neck and so I always wore a blouse/top with a collar to ease the pressure. So far it is traveling well and no show of wearing out.
5	This was my first time buying vanilla beans but was very surprised with how good they smelled even through the packaging. One of these was plenty to make a syrup with great flavor!
5	Very strong I’m sure this will protect your phone from the heaviest drops.
5	Would never question buying anything from this seller. The most professional and courteous customer service. Went above and beyond to resolve the smallest of issues. Perfection.
5	Recently I bought a new laptop. It has only two USB ports which are not enough. Because of this reason, I bought this USB Type-C Hub, which offers three extra USB ports. This perfectly solved my problem. I am happy with it.
5	I was very happy to receive the goods. It was very good on the grade. It was especially suitable after installation. The picture was clear, the operation was simple and easy to understand. I didn’t let me down. The last one was not clear. There is no problem with this. Very good, cost-effective is still very high, recommended to buy, all praise service is very thoughtful.
5	Love it! We are trying to get some security set up in our house since we have a little one on the way and this is perfect for the nursery as a clock that no one would suspect is a hidden camera. The picture quality is great and the app is super easy to use. We would definitely buy it again and might have to get some more for our house.
5	I'm so extremely happy with my new bluetooth headphones! Very happy with the quality and you cannot beat the price! I use mine for listening to music while I exercise, whether I'm at the gym or going on a jog with my dog. Great sound quality and noise cancellation is fantastic as well! I'm happy with the hands free ability to control my music as well...much better than not being able to control my playlist at all. They're also pretty comfy and I didn't have issues with them getting wet while I worked out; nice and dry the whole time. If you're looking for great quality without spending $100, these are definitely worth the $20.
5	Always happy with this brand; works far better, and stains far less than other brands. Have purchased before, and will purchase again.
5	These candles smell amazing and are really nicely packaged. Great for a gift or to try the different scents!
5	This is so easy to use and I think my coffee does taste better.
5	Love these lights! I plan to hang them on our back patio but they could really be hung anywhere. I’m happy with my purchase.
5	Great sound and comfort
5	Great food! I usually separate it into individual meals to minimize waste. Some of my birds like one flavor/shape, and other birds prefer other flavors/shapes. I give everybody what they like. :)
5	Absolutely awesome. Great fit. I only wish it was a buckle instead of button closure. I put this in my cart and took it out several times. I wish I’d have bought it when I saw it. It’s lower profile than it looks. Great for men or women.
5	My 9 year old daughter likes this book
5	Beautiful piece and made to last a long time.
5	Nice smell, easy to use
5	Looks as good as an Otterbox at a fraction of the price
5	Match my super doodle pens perfectly.Wish they were instock all the time
5	Too much bass. but battery life is perfect. price also great. I bought a like new product from warehouse, but it's brand new(even package wasn't broken!)
5	Delicious honey in a small, easy to open packet!! It’s the perfect amount of honey for use in tea or for right before a vocal performance/lesson!
5	I purchased this on a whim as I never buy the refill size in my grocery store. I will be reordering it again when I run low. There is enough product in this bottle to refill my old container 3 times. Since it is only me doing the dishes, it has lasted me for a couple months. I recommend this highly.
5	The colors on this bag are really neat, super bright and colorful. I bought this bag for my daughter who is currently in 5th grade. She used it today for the first time and received several compliments on it. It is large enough for a large binder, several workbooks and her lunch bag. The side pockets are great for her water bottle and she was thrilled by the secret pocket in the inside. It seems like a well made bag, sturdy and durable. Overall she is very happy with this bag!
5	Light weight and good maneuverability. For some reason, it is wet inside the package when I received it. Maybe the seller did leak test before they send it? Don't drag it on the ground. Even the heavy duty ones will break that way.
5	Love this product, very hydrating and smells like sage.
5	The wife used one at home, one in the car, the other in the office. The fast arrival was good Quality seems superb and the strength is what I've been looking for. It charges her iPhone and the iPad nicely. The cable is very sturdy and strong with the nylon braids around it so it wont break easily. Will buy next time . very satisfied with product
5	Good size! good price! looked great this Christmas!
5	Great price for the package of 2. Have had trouble finding this tape in stores. Works well and stays stuck.
5	Wonderful candles for birthday gags! I got these for my 22nd birthday, and everyone loved them !
5	Fit and quality very impressive
5	Loved this whole new take on this book!
5	I have used Estee Lauder Youth Dew for 58 years. I have never bought anything else. Love it.
5	I have a new LG Stylo 4 phone and I managed to immediately lose my stylus. This replacement stylus is identical to the one that came with the phone and it works perfectly and stays clicked in to the phone stylus receptacle. I can only speak to my phone model, but I recommend it.
5	The end result was indeed smaller than the advertising pictures but it fit my living room well. It took 2 of us to make sure it was aligned. It has been on my wall for 4 days now without any issues of coming off. A Good Buy!
5	Maybe took 3 minutes to install and took care of the issue.
5	I use Head and Shoulders a lot it works very well for my dandruff
5	Paid 50$ for a used roomba and these have worked perfect fit right in.
5	Very impressed! Was nervous but it looks way more expensive then it really is. The engraving were perfec. It's an awesome knife, my boyfriend loves it! Fast shipping too!
5	Good show! Thought that more were made!
5	Great purchase. Outstanding quality.
5	They are what I wanted, the look of blue glass without the breaking hazards.
5	Good quality acid free paper.
5	Works great! I use when my IP is on a slow cooker setting and the food comes out just like it does using a CrockPot.
5	Cleans my tattoo well. The soap doesn't have a smell. Recommend this to anyone who gets their first second and so forth for their tattoos
5	Exactly what I was looking for a light weight jacket. Fits my 10 year old well but will probably not 2 seasons out of it.
5	Perfect and just my color.
5	Fit great nicely made recommend
5	the size is relatively small to a man but it is perfect for my wife. she uses it as a diaper bag. when we are going out, she put the go pro in it in case there is raining day. also the diapers, bottles, all the stuff the baby girl need. it has one front pocket and the main pocket, in the main pocket there is "fence" so you could put a wallet or doc there. we are really satisfied with this product.
5	Great value for the price. Easily cuts up herbs. Love that the case is also the cleaner to get the bits out of the blades. I had basil and chives readily available when I got these. Chopped up so quick! Sooooo much easier than my knife! And my husband says "safer for me too." Highly recommend this nifty gadget!
5	Really good shorts I’ve done a lot of work in them and they hold up well I’ve had these shorts for two years still haven’t wore them out GOD is love
5	I purchased this after a friend recommended it. I have fine medium length hair and this works amazingly on my hair. It doesn't tangle, gives volume, and is much easier to manage then the blow dryer/roll brush combo. I divide my hair into three sections starting with lower/base of hair drying my way up. The whole process takes maybe less than 15 minutes from starting. It also works great for next day hair to work out any waves or kinks from sleeping.
5	Beautiful dress and great price!
5	Very well made, nice clean look, very light weight,great price, got here fast
5	Oil filter was what I expected. Fast shipping. Will utilize source again
5	For about the same amount I would spend for 8 batteries at a big box store... I got 50 of theses. Quality is great. arrived fast... fresh... date on packages was less than 30 days old. I use these in several items. Installed 4 into a night fishing baseball hat... bright and powerful. Will post a follow-up if these do not last as long as the big name brands. But based on other reviews I think they will.
5	The book was extremely helpful in revealing common mistakes writers make about such things as "point of view", "beats", "flow", and other writing topics that have a tendency to keep a manuscript from being readable. i refer to it quite often and bought a copy for a middle school language arts teacher that I know.
5	I absolutely love this book! As a former PreK teacher, I feel this message is so important and should be in every school! Its so heart warming and beautifully written! I have 5 nephews and 1 on the way they will each be receiving a copy!!
5	I got a unit made out of this hair !! Love it will be buying it again
5	Very comfortable and soft.
5	Great fitting shirt, and great price
5	I am a Nurse and I bought these sox for work, they are soft and great for circulation, I love them.
5	Super soft and the color is exactly as shown in the picture. Arrived in perfect condition! Very pleased!!
5	Just as described perfect part
5	First off, I love the look and length of this adorable piece! The added bonus that I must have missed while reading the product description, is the little slot on the back for her harness to attach so she can stay warm on walks. Might buy in the other colors! Love it!
5	This device is pretty easy to install if you have any modicum of plumbing knowledge. The video makes everything clear. This bidet is my first try at such devices and bought it because it was cheap and my interest was piqued. It has cut the need to TP way down and really leaves a bum feeling clean and refreshed. Can't speak for the ladies, however. My wife is still giving it the stink eye so I'm not sure if she is using it in secret or not. I don't check or ask. We have the cold water model only but I find it refreshing as the bum is not as prone to shock as the rest of the body. If you have been thinking about buying a bidet attachment, this has been a good one.
5	Good quality with low price. The logistics is very fast. I'm glad I chose this! heavy duty cable, works well The point is that the resilience of this Anker cable is incredible. The value of the product. The husband is very satisfied with it. It's a great gift This is a nice cable!
5	Bought this product for my new tattoo shop because a lot of clients were asking to charge their phone, and I always out of the phone charger cables, and always lost control of where to put all the phones. After I got this station, it worked so good you can just plug one outlet in, and you have so many ports that you can charge the phones at the one place. No more messy desk. Highly recommend to any of you looking to charge a lot of phones at the same time.
5	I like that it goes on and off at the lowest setting without having to cycle through all settings to get to off. Dim setting is bright enough for most uses and the bright setting is really bright. It also has a very bright fast flash. Not sure what that's for.
5	Shipping was fast and they are perfect. So Cute!
5	Loved these sandals. Needed closed toe shoes. Cute for the summer months.
5	Usually buy the Cranberry Almond Thins, but the Mano Coconut are really good. Filling, crunchy and satisfying.
5	we used these over the weekend to make so many different colors of slime. The colors came out vibrant and didn't fade.
5	This is the same cord that comes in the box with your iPhone/iPad. It has worked fine for me so far. Does not come with a wall adapter, FYI
5	Sliders work great on carpet or my non-carpeted areas too!
5	Great buy for storage
5	First time I used it all of the water in the drain flowed out. Love it.
5	It was very nice!! Loving it!
5	This has got to be the best keyboard I've used in recent years and I've been through countless Keyboards over the years. The Ergonomics of this keyboard design is Excellent! I am blown away at how comfortable it is to use and the factor of the whole thing is just so sleek; it almost look like the keyboard is floating on your desk. I haven't enjoyed typing like this in years. The feedback of the keys are responsive and my fingers just fly with each loud click coming from the keys. This keyboard is a right choice 10/10 !!!
5	Tay is awesome. Even as a person who is also in the same industry Tay has been a GREAT influence to me especially my transition to the vegan/vegetarian lifestyle. Very knowledgeable and passionate and I'll continue to work with him. *****
5	Used por 15 on my project car, floors, under the body, the spary cans make it way easier to do touch ups and actually paint a whole parts without dragging out the paint gun, glad it comes in spray cans as well.
5	This one is much better than my old one, easy to install, easy to switch, feel real, good workmanship, fast signal switching and the most important thing is the remote control, I like this remote control.You don't have to press around every time you switch.Buy right!
5	Finally, a mattress pad of good quality that fits properly and is the perfect thickness. After trying two other mattress pads and being disappointed, this one is great!
5	Great product. Fits perfectly
5	I ordered these to help my Toddler want to start taking baths again. She loves using these with the lights off! Eye light weight. Easy to use. Portable and travels well. I took these with me out of town for all the cousins to use during bath time. It was a hit.
5	I purchased this product on the recommendation of a chemist friend who waxes not stop about the benefits of Vitamin C. The real issue though is that the cheaper ones don't absorb well. What matters is how much is absorbed into the body, not how much you put in. The Liposomal is made in a way that the majority of the Vitamin C is absorbed, whereas the regular cheaper vitamin C absorbs at perhaps 20-25% efficiency.
5	Great price, very soft, beautiful colors, well made.
5	So far so good, I bought this baby boy clothes set for my little boy, the quality is flexible but it was good, my son is 6 month, I think what I bought this set can fit from 5 month to 1 year old, so I like this clothes set so far.
5	Great packaging and pristine condition. Arrived on time.
5	Fits perfectly on my Chevy 98 pickup. A/C compressor was not kicking in. Changed it and worked.
5	A grate wine stopper at a good price
5	Well made goes together tight with no wobbling and feels good in the hand.
5	Obviously these are pretty standard silicone straws, nothing too fancy, but I LOVE them! The colors are cute (the mint and gray are my fave), they clean super easily, and I'm happy to do our part in decreasing plastic straw waste. I've had them for a month now, and we take them with us on all our summer trips: on the boat, to the cabin, etc. The kids each have their own color so they can easily identify their beverage, and I don't have to worry about them tripping with a plastic or metal straw in their mouths and injuring themselves. As a mom, that's a huge win! Definitely a good purchase.
5	JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR A SORE LEG CANNOT RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH
5	My partner and I have really enjoyed this product. The straps are comfortable and easy to adjust. The straps can be tucked under the mattress to be both discrete and convenient.
5	Great snack, gluten free and price is right
5	Little tuff to set but its fine
5	Shared with a friend, she loved them
5	great product. Its perfect for someone wanting to get a mid level drone. easy controls and great camera. will be buying another one.
5	i have no complaints what so ever. they work great.
5	They add a lot to my appliances. They came very quick
5	What I liked the most about using these Gelatin Vitamins was how quickly my nails started to grow and the strength of them. I always have had thin and brittle nails but now they are finally starting to harden. I also started noticing how much my skin has cleared up on face!
5	kids really loved these
5	When I received it, just looking at it I thought I might return it. Reason - on my first few tries , the grips on my nose started hurting and that concerned me. Primary reason for me buying this was the fact that I needed it for a cycling event. Decided to give it one more try and boy I was glad I did not return. Did a 62 mile bicycle ride in rainy and windy conditions. These hold good on the eyes, no moisture accumulation and not once they fell off or were loose. What I like the most was the extra rubber on the top of the frame which prevented wind and water from seeping through the top of the sunglasses. Worth the buy
5	This set felt like Mary Poppins purse! I knew everything that was included but it felt like I would never be done pulling everything out of the package. This set is huge and lots of things to make the switch more fun or to protect it. Super colorful accessories as well! My son loves having the little steering wheels for Mario Cart.
5	A wallet that fits all my IDs and credit cards!
5	Great bass and music quality. Lite weight and can be carried around
5	Very Good Product Very Fast Shipping...👍👍👍
5	LOVE IT! The original watch band was giving me a rash which is why I went looking for a different one! After reading the review I thought I would try and I’m so happy I did... no more rash, very comfortable and love the color! I will be buying more! I would give this more stars if I could!
5	Because captain america is the bleep! Gotta collect them all.
5	Lights arrived quickly. Had a minor issue with one and they shipped a replacement immediately. Love them. Very bright.
5	I have expensive colored pencils and this wool felted pencil organizer is perfect for keeping them safe. The color is bright a d cheery a d the wool.felt is thick and strong. The pencil slots are a perfect fit for my pencils. I like it so much I am going to get a second one.
5	I have been buying this brand for about 6 months and I love it - chocolate of course. I have it for breakfast and lunch I originally found the shake to be too watery...so to solve that issue and make it thicker, I add a tablespoon of chia seeds to 10oz of water, 2 scoops of powder, mix with blender and then put in freezer for 15 minutes. The chia seeds absorb the liquid and turn this into a thicker shake. I cannot have it any other way. Chia seeds contain more omega-3s than salmon, and Omega-3 fatty acids help raise HDL cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol that protects against heart attack and stroke. . Enjoy!!!
5	Really good replica! Doesn’t tarnish
5	This Swing is so easy to set up and move that even Nana can do it. Gemma Loves to swing indoors or outside Stops the grumpy baby and brings back my angel.
5	Only been using this about a month. We shred A LOT. This shredder is easy to maneuver around the office. It operates at a normal volume and is not too loud. It handles credit cards pretty well. We shredded 10 pages at a time without issue. All in all a good value for the price.
5	Recently my son went on a trip with his high school, it was a three day trip. They spent about eight hours in the past traveling. This speaker came in handy, they were able to use it most of the ride, they put on the window he was getting charged well they were playing music and just having fun. Recently my son went on a trip with his high school, it was a three day trip. They spent about eight hours in the bus traveling. This speaker came in handy, they were able to use it most of the ride, they put it on the window it was getting charged well they were playing music and just having fun. Especially with the bus with no charging station, this feature was off the hook, the solar charging. All of his friends had talked about it, snap chatted about it. Very convenient, easy connect via Bluetooth, The sound quality is amazing, it’s loud, it’s clear, and you can actually feel the bass as well, super amazing charge features. And the list goes on and on. This is an amazing speaker overall and buy, highly recommend this product.
5	Works like it shoukd
5	My son loves the flavor and he is super picky
5	Exactly what I wanted, closes and stays closed, not to big and phone fits nice and tight.

5	I loved it. Well made, nice quality. Received on time. Thanks!
5	They are amazing Very high Quality . They stay in place and do not slide around like other Company brands.
5	Great intro to investing. If you are new in stock market, then this book is for you. You don't need any background o experience investing or trading.
5	Seems to fit the necessary items for gymnastics, but it isn’t as light weight as we expected.
5	Beautiful musical show. This part must have been written for John Legend who is just outstanding as are the other actors. If you enjoy musicals, I'd put this one at the top of my list.
5	This is the best wallet I have ever had. All my credit cards fit in it, and it has the RFID, which I really like. Nice leather!
5	I have the blanket for several weeks - it does exceed my original expectations.. so lightweight and comfortable. The price is decent too!
5	I have an Anker powercore 2 20000 and it charges it very rapidly. In about 4-5 hours which is much faster than my standard wall charger.
5	And painted the blades to look like a rainbow while it is working
5	Got this for my son. He said he likes it plays good and clear very happy son
5	A beautiful piece of furniture. It took a lot of tweaking to get the drawers to slide in nicely, but we still love it. It’s sturdy and holds so much in each drawer!
5	This is the perfect dock, no extra software to install, uses the full power and speed of USB 3.0, and completely foolproof. I got two for the purpose of transferring files from my old desktop HDDs to a new laptop. Gets the job done without any fuss, unlike some other docks I've used. This dock is sturdy and solidly built. It will rest on your desk and stay perfectly still. I can't write a lengthy review because this dock just WORKS exactly like it should, plain and simple, which is exactly what I wanted.
5	I love the set and it was very affordable. Thank you so much for the products you offer. I definitely will be buying more products that you offer!
5	The color matched the Apple Watch band with screen protector. It looks very beautiful to wearing. I love it !
5	Love it, love it. Super expensive but worth it.
5	great product for the price, easy installation 👍🏼
5	Perfect product for adding fiber to baked goods.
5	Using this stuff forever and really gets the job done. Is water proof for summer on the lake,
5	You'll see that there a lot of negative reviews on this film, but the movie was honest, fair, and straightforward. It was truthful--not propaganda, and it is worth your time.
5	Fast delivery and good condition.
5	When I first ordered this I was worried that it would be huge, but it's not, it's perfectly sized.It has a nice firm and smooth feel to it and is actually really powerful, even the lowest setting is reasonably powerful. Easy to use, and I was surprised that my partner let me use it on him.Great for clitoral stimulation too.
5	My dad has varicose vains. And me, as a woman, i don’t want to get as many as him. So now when sitting for most of the day or standing for long periods of time or dancing for hours or traveling... i put these on! I have a dozen of ‘em now
5	I love these shoes and the price was just right! The sizing was great too!
5	Great starter book for those interested in trying out the Keto. So we all heard the craze about this new diet, however, the information I found was pretty intimidating. This book was really good at explaining what Keto actually is. The recipes are super simple and you probably already have the ingredients in your pantry. Definitely recommended for newbies looking into the Keto diet.
5	Nice and sturdy! Makes your Night Stand look Elegant. Takes care of all your Apple products! Will defiantly have this in mind for giving this as a gift to friends and relatives!
5	It's a good product. I'm very satisfied. Thank u.
5	I will never this life changing book. The experience was almost transcendental, this author has a permanent place on my bookshelf.
5	Nice to have when your light go out or when you get up in the middle of the night to get a drink lights go on I have them in my kitchen.
5	Received it fast and on time for my camping event easy to install and/or set up with rain and all never lost power and they were nice and bright 100 ft 100 bulb to be exact ..... awesome can’t complain I recommend to all great purchase !!!!
5	Takes care of my sugar cravings and really tastes good.
5	Great for post cards
5	This cord would probably last 100 years. Extra long too. Great job!
5	Just the right size for cleaning my AR. The assembly guide on the pad isn't necessary for me, but it looks pretty cool.
5	It is a nice toy but the stop sign remains opened. I plan to return it
5	No longer do I have to be stranded when I walk out of the house without my keys!
5	These batteries last a long time. I like how they are packaged. Good buy. Would definitely buy again
5	It is nice lunch bag, it’s a medium size. Such a cute bag.
5	like their food icons to separate food , I can cut my food apart no fear that they will get other smells.
5	Great cords I would like to see my cat chew through this one
5	Good quality: super soft and comfortable to use. Comes in a super cute bag with a laundry bag, will 10/10 recommend this to all of my friends.
5	These things are awesome! Wish the metric set came with all sizes but able to fill the gaps with the standard set. Well worth the money
5	This eyebrow pencil is amazing! It's exactly what I've been looking for! I love how it looks so natural and really brings out my natural eyebrows without appearing chalky and unnatural. It doesn't take much to apply. A few light strokes and your done, beautiful natural looking eyebrows. I will definitely be keeping this my makeup bag for daily usage and certainly be ordering this again. Thank you!
5	Great books for 12yo
5	happy wife-happy life
5	Highly recomend!! Holds a great edge and is very affordable!
5	I purchased this coat stand for the bedroom. My husband likes to hang his clothes on the closet door at night and it was starting to wear down the paint on the door. We had a small corner and I didn't want to purchase a men's wardrobe as it might have been too large for the space. This coat stand worked perfectly. It's sturdy to hold clothes on one or all sides with tipping. It looks like a night piece of furniture in the bedroom. I would highly recommend.
5	Have tried a bunch of other live traps. This is my favorite. It is very hardy, the mice can't chew their way out of it, which some have done with the cheaper traps. Plenty of ventilation so the mice don't fog up the inside of the trap and overheat or run out of air.
5	I loved this movie. I'm sewing and designing myself for over 20 yrs, so I was particular interested in details of making dresses, trials, and it's all so real and well done. The story and the characters are developed so well, so you can feel the breathing of the society, with always present envy out of being bored with life, and all sorts of pressures. And really weird love story. I enjoyed the ambience this movie provided, with the pictures, conversation and music. I layed back and truly enjoyed over 2 hrs, not even being aware how long it is. As I said in the title, like reading a good book. Once you can't find time or focus to do so :-)
5	Very high quality!! This is an awesome deal! I'll be being a few more this next fall.
5	Our granddaughter is loving it, she gets to play and it gives her space to walk while keeping her safe
5	It was a gift and they liked it. I would absolutely recommend.
5	I love this. Squishy so if baby pulls it down it won't hurt anything. I love this
5	Great case, had it for about 4 months now and no scratching!
5	This was a great read. Enjoyed it from beginning to the end. Looking forward to next book in the series.
5	is for yoga. it works.
5	Very compact. Got all my cards, and cash in this wallet and it is much thinner than my old traditional wallet.
5	Great for oils or Great for DIY alcohol ink making
5	This is an excellent water flosser, and a great value. This flosser is just as powerful as their countertop unit, but takes less space and is more attractive. It is easy to fill and comfortable to use. I flossed 3 times a day for 4 days on a single charge. It comes with a handy travel bag also. H2ofloss makes a quality product at a reasonable price.
5	Worked as advertised for mounting my sound bar to my TCL 50" TV
5	LOVE! Super cute and lightweight so my daughter wore them all day shopping and didn't complain, yet they kept her feet warm. Exactly the boot we were looking for!
5	I needed something to lash down/ tie-down over sized material when transporting stuff. This works well. EZ to use, it is strong, and packs nicely when not needed.
5	Now we are living a bark free life! Within two days it had cut out 99% of non-essential barking! At last you can feel peace and quietness in our house! We love our beagles but they were driving us crazy! It really detects barking from far away, now we don’t even hear our neighbor dogs. Great quality and cute btw...This has been a life saver! We are able to get proper sleep now!
5	Nice bright light, very easy to put on, can be used for holiday or daily lighting
5	Great product for home use
5	This has been a great tent.. we have had it up 24/7 for 17 months in a shady area at our annual camp site at the lake and have had no problems, until a deer decided to go thru it during a storm... now we only need a new screen, everything else is still fine.
5	Very high quality and high end
5	Great price - well made - look good !
5	My daughter loved this pillow... She already named it as Jungle pillow... Quality is too good perfect size for toddlers... And am very happy with the purchase
5	Easy to remove. Hard to install. Could not get the threads to catch to screw in.
5	Just ordered it recently and used a few times already. Really simple and comfortable. Love that it comes with lube.

5	Light, easy to fold and carry and thick!
5	Fast delivery. Exactly what I wanted. Fits nice and comfortable.
5	Using it as rain cover for patio furniture. Well made and durable. Protects the cushions against the rain very well.
5	My husband is so pleased with this hat. It’s his favorite brand. Great find!
5	I ended up purchasing this one simply because it looked more cushiony than most, and it certainly is! With the extra cushion it allows my baby to not bobble around in the grocery cart, I love this product! Would definitely recommend!!
5	This product works well. So well in fact that I thought it was going to suck the skin off of my face! I didn’t use steam to open my pores up and it still pulled junk out of my pores! I have always had blackheads pretty bad, and this tool helps tremendously!
5	The unconditional love that Nathan had for Nat was heartwarming and beautiful. My heart and soul have been nourished. Stories like this are too few.
5	This drone is so easy to use and learn quadcopter flying and operation. I got this drone from my wife and daughters for Christmas and am already able to fly it with ease. I can fly it through my house (from bedroom, through halls, up stairs, from living room to kitchen) with ease already. This is a great entry level drone! I asked for a different drone, but am glad I got this one instead.
5	I've using this kitchen knife for a week, so far it's still sharp for cutting everything includes beef, my husband likes it so much.
5	Good quality. Exactly what I expected! My fur kids love it!
5	The colors matched my daughters wedding shower perfectly!!
5	Lots of compliments and very comfy.
5	It is a quality product that is easy to use.
5	We used these lights around our table while camping. They are smaller so they worked great for that purpose.
5	these blades are excellent. They are durable and smooth cutting
5	The purchase was amazing and it was everything that I needed.
5	So my dog goes through a toy in ten minutes. I don't care. I just care that I get to the squeaker before he does and that I don't have to clean up much stuffing. I love that these have rope inside them. It keeps him occupied for an extra 20 minutes and they are not too expensive. I've bought KONG wild knots at least 20 times.
5	Great price! They fit great and are very comfortable and look good too!!
5	it's not a Gitzo but. 7 ft max height, Plus it is also a Monopod, about 6 ft. very well made. heavier than I would thought. Great head, all works very smooth. Also, handle on tripod and includes carry case. I have no regrets. VERY HAPPY with purchase.
5	I hike in Redwood Park most days of the week, and I've searched the internet for photos and history of the area before it was a park. This book has answered so many questions: who are the trails named after, where were the mills and homes located, what were these old remnants of steps and foundations, and much more. Thank you, Ms. Marshall.
5	This thing is both precious and perfect. Well made, super cute, lots of space. I love it to death already! The little snake is great.
5	My dog loves it. Ordering second pack.
5	Fantastic I have a arctic entry way with no door small entrance way into house..and it is cold no heat put this up and the living room hold the heat ..would recommend..
5	We got it delivered today and the first thing we did was put it in the dishwasher. This will replace our 10 year old set. It is a better made set then our old one and looks better.
5	Works well and resolved the F 21 problem. Very easy install. Simply no issues. In for a week now so need time for durability.
5	The granddaughter loved it and plays with it a bunch.
5	This beer dispenser is so AWESOME!!! Bought it for my hubby as he is constantly saying "you never think about me". It gives him something fun to do when he wants a cold beer! Glad I made his day!
5	Arrived on time and well packaged. In the winter (in MA) we love sleeping in a cool/cold bedroom, but never looked forward to crawling into those chilly sheets. Now those sheet are nice and toasty when we retire. We set the temp on low about 15 -- 20 minutes before bedtime, go to bed and turn off pad. Works great.
5	Tiny ears and works the best for working out and general use. Traditional ear buds never fit and simply fall out even while I’m stationary. Really wish Sony had this in wireless.
5	very clear install instructions
5	No problem so far. Do what they say they are supposed to do.
5	I am trying to do what Jesus said... and drink a glass of wine a day...for my stomach. I observed my son always wrestling with opening a new bottle and becoming increasingly frustrated, with the process. ...I noticed... I checked out the ones advertised on TV... for a small fortune and then found this type, which I didn't' even know existed! I began reading reviews on Amazon and chose this one. It was a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it! No more stress over opening a bottle of wine! He has fun and it is so fast! It 's fun to watch, as well! Cool blue light. A quality made product, slick packaging and looks much more expensive, than it is. Extra pieces included are very nice. Fabulous gift!
5	Fits great button snaps very positively
5	It arrives with a small blow but it's fine.
5	I put these up around my classroom and my home. I put one on my front door because I think it’s important for people to be uplifted.
5	Nice product Nice quality
5	Perfect replacement for my old, dead battery packs! Back in business!😁
5	I got this charger base so I can attach my Oslo Pocket to a mini tripod for motion time lapse video. The camera fits perfectly into the charger base and works great for what I need it for!
5	Everything was just as described. Arrived as advertised and easy to install
5	Perfect product and very fast shipping A+ Amazon seller.
5	So far so good. The speakers are very reasonably priced and sound great in my boat powered by the stock 8-track headunit. Cant wait to hear them after I install my kenwood headunit.
5	Love her writings and to have some favorites in a smaller book to carry to the beach has been amazing.
5	Efficient and effective
5	Tremendous quality for the price and works great
5	Wow you get so much for your money and they look amazing!!
5	Great product, feels a bit different when wet, but makes my hair full, and healthy.
5	We ordered these for our sons' birthday party favors. All of the kids LOVED them!!! No complaints. They are so unique and kids can't get enough.
5	My husband uses for post total knee replacement therapy. He loves it
5	It took a bit to really get into this book and understand it really is her diary. However once you do you won’t want to put it down. It gives you a genuine look into what she was experiencing from a young girl to a grown woman. It made me laugh and cry. She writes so well!
5	These are the best socks I ever wore when running. I actually purchased another pack.
5	Granddaughter...and daughter love this movie!
5	My daughter loved it. She takes it to school everyday. Good quality
5	Fit my phone perfectly. Slim case just what I wanted.
5	Definitely recommend. Lots of storage space and great value for these items.
5	Great little flash for the Fujifilm X series cameras. Not bulky like regular size flashes and gets the job done. Love that it has HSS...definitely a plus. So far has world great. Recycling time is pretty fast. For the money, it can't be beat. I'm happy with this product.
5	These Kirkland allergy tablets are an incredible value! They provide the overnight allergy relief I need and they help me to fall asleep. I no longer wake up sneezing!
5	This was the gift of the day for my 7 year old. He lost all interest in his other gifts once he received this! It’s still his favorite 5 months later and he has at least 20-30 different kinds of nerf guns.
5	My granddaughter loves it
5	Go on easily - low matte finish-look better than Totes
5	Bought this in King size. When I opened the box I questioned my choice. It looked like there were a thousand pieces and we would be all night putting it together. SURPRISE!! it took about 45 minutes at the most and that was because my boyfriend insisted on helping. Without him, maybe 20-30 LOL. It was that easy. I was stunned by how strong the bed was. We are both over 300 lbs. and it didn't even creak. We thought we needed a new mattress. Turns out we needed the platform on this bed. I would give this bed a 10 if I could. I will follow up on how it holds up to our weight for other plus size folks looking for a good bed, but for now, it's a 10 for me.
5	My friends loved these as a gift.
5	Amazing customer service. Quick responses. Easy to work with. And, very customer oriented.
5	It was more than I expected. I love them. They were intended to be a Christmas gift but kept them for myself and purchased my sister something else.
5	Very cute. Can be used for kids or adults. Happy customer!
5	I got these and the hinges from this company and all I can say is WOW! Best chance I took on a product EVER! If your on the fence about this product or their claims, get off your a$$ and buy these things. Quick install, SOLID product and great price, what more do you want? Even if you have a new cooler, just get these and install them and save yourself some frustration......YES THEY ARE THAT GREAT!
5	i have a canon rebel and these work perfectly! What a lifesaver extra batteries are.
5	When you need just a little bit to bring the car to a near-max weight limit. Best if used in conjunction with solid metal weights.
5	This ashtray is beautiful and had held up with no rust in the rain and wind outside.
5	It's like described, cute and size is perfect. Only flaw for me is how my top makes my chest Look flat. Still love it...fast shipping too!
5	Like that you can turn off the fans and lights if you don't need them. Great feature if your running on battery since the PC is what powers it.
5	Works as advertised. Good package, Thank you!
5	My husband loves them, Christmas Vacation is his favorite movie, these are perfect for his Christmas pajamas this year.
5	Looks exactly as pictured and fits my pillows perfectly! Was able to get both pillow cases on without any threads snapping, so that says a good bit about the stitching quality! Will definitely buy from the brand again when looking to freshen up the look of my house!
5	Super cute! She loved it! Good quality
5	That Bluetooth is a Very good one,I talk a lot to people in Jamaica while going to work in New York.I am living in Newark nj.I would recommend it to anyone .
5	Just like the pic kids will have fun great for party bags
5	I like them because sometimes you order thing that are not the size they say. these are large the size they say love them.
5	I have fed my dogs Instinct Raw Boost for years. I have two big dogs, one with digestive issues, and then added a third big dog to my pack, so that brand of food was too expensive when I have to buy a 21lb bag every week or so. Dog Food Advisor gave this 5 stars, so I tried it. My problem dog didn't have any problems at all transitioning to this food, and my Great Pyrenees with allergies has had no issues. I am extremely pleased with this food. I would highly recommend it.
5	Exactly what I was looking for. I wanted my Dot in a central location in the house. Great Product!!!
5	Perfect!! Fresh and delectable. As good or better than any other brands I have tried
5	Very good quality and glad I paid a bit more for these. Only problem was one of the box of 30 handles had 13 handles which had a hole spacing of over three inches. Fortunately I was able to use those for drawers and keep the three inch handles for the cupboards. Had that not worked out, I was close to having to return them. The second box was ok.....thirty handles with three inch spacing as advertised. So check the contents carefully when you get them.....I think I saw other reviews where people didn't get all three inch handles. I still rated it five stars due to the quality.
5	It was just what I needed
5	We Bought this for our Granddaughter. She likes it. Very small and nice for a preschooler.
5	Girlfriend loved this
5	Haven't used it yet. All items received are & look like good quality.
5	Great for suppressing my appetite between meals. The product arrived as described, the softgels have no smell of taste and they use high potency C8 and C10. Great product, price and value.
5	They sound good and the battery life lasts a lot longer then what I expected
5	Does the job for basic cooking, like eggs or omelets. Not a big surface area so not great for transferring a big item anywhere.
5	My bone density tests have been improved since I have been taking supplements for my bones.
5	Really like this replacement band. The magnetic clasp seems to be pretty strong.
5	I like this drain snake better than others I have used in the past. The handle is sturdier and easier to hold onto. It does the job it needs to and works well with cleaning a drain. I have not used the grabber yet but it looks like it would function well also.
5	Perfect for holding up my tiny house on wheels. I needed to buy a total of 8 to keep the trailer from bowing but the strength and stability are perfect. Not for lifting only for holding. You need to bring your own jack to lift the trailer.
5	Half the price of peckers and just as good, I’m certainly impressed!
5	I'm about a size 14 and this over up made me feel so sexy. I loved it!
5	Really appreciate the basic packaging. After the cord on my MacBook Pro failed, I ordered one from apple, but it was the wrong one. This one though, works like a charm!
5	Works great good picture on the front camera good picture on the rear camera easy to work with the touchscreen on the mirror
5	Case is sturdy and even came with 2 screen protectors. Great for the price!
5	Husband likes it very much
5	packed as it is. good product with quality
5	Hubby loved these gel sneakers. They wear well and fit great, providing excellent comfort for his 50 year old feet.
5	Fast delivery. The item and package was not damaged.
5	If you are planting plugs this is a necessity. If you have a good lawn with a few bad spots, I still think this can be very handy.
5	These are such a deal! High quality at a low price. Super soft and comfy and the colors are perfect. Definitely going to buy more. Love these!
5	Nice and short. Good regular quality. Adhesive is durable, even a little hard to take off.
5	My husband is very happy with it! He can’t wait until duck season to use it.
5	I'm not a ruffle person, but this dress is super sexy and I receive compliments on it every time I wear it.
5	Good quality! Super cute! I loved it and it fit so well!
5	This mat was exactly as described, great quality mat and graphics. Highly recommended.
5	It's a really pretty cover and the fact that they showed what each color phone looked like under the design really helped me choose the perfect cover. It's textured on back, so it helps grip the phone and I'm very pleased with it.
5	It took me forever to find a to-do notebook/shopping list like this one. It has made my life SO much more organized! I needed something more day to day that didn't necessarily need a meeting calendar- but still needed the occasionally important time to remember.
5	Heavy duty, very secure, works great
5	I could write a lot about this book, but it left me a crying snotty mess and very few books do that so, there ya go.
5	Really neat table. Just the right size for what we needed.
5	I love this product! Feels amazing on my dry winter skin. And smells yummy - would buy again!
5	Perfect for the granddaughter
5	THIS BOOK MAKES READING FUN!!!
5	My friend is very happy with her book . She finds it very inspiring. Love this book . Thank you
5	I do some photography so this was pretty cool to have, I have been wanting one for quite some time. I decided to cave in and get one. I must say I love it. It is very bright but you can also adjust it down a few stops. It came with a holder for your phone as well if you use your phone. My kids like it to make youtube videos with also. The tripod is not super sturdy but it does the job - we haven't had it fall or anything but it seems like it could pretty easily. The light does adjust from side to side as well so you can rotate it around. It can be changed from a cooler or warm light, this helped when using it with my camera but when I used my phone I didn't notice as much of a difference (I assume my phone tries to autocorrect the white balance anyways so that might be why). It's a fun little gadget to play with! Also it has a USB plug so you can just plug it into a computer as well if needed!
5	I really like these boxes for shoe organization. They may be a little taller than most shoe boxes, so if you plan to put them on shelves stacked two high, be sure that your shelves are tall enough. They are large enough to hold two pair of flats, so I was able to put about 20 pair in 12 boxes. Great!
5	These are good size and very colorful
5	Lovely, bright red shiny heart. Looks great on my handbags.
5	One of those that you Can't put down until the end! Anxiously awaiting the next BOOK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! PLEASE!
5	We’ve bought 3 packs now. They are great little lights. Really bright and light up the front of the house well. Surprised we could get this brightness out of solar lights. Happy customer for sure.
5	Such a fun game! My kids have been glued to it for weeks so far!
5	The headline says it all. The case is just what I was looking for in terms of functionality and color and was shipped very promptly!!
5	Perfect shirt! Great quality looks super cute on. I ordered a large, I do wish I got a medium it’s a tad big. For reference I am 5’3 165 and I usually go between and medium and large depending on the shirt.
5	After many seasons of basketball, football and marching band, I finally treated myself! I'm a much happier fan because now I'm a much more comfortable fan!
5	Super cute!! Shipping was fast! So far I’m loving this lipstick it is very hydrating on my lips! Would highly recommend! 😊
5	Love this hammock, I ordered a different hammock and it was a disaster. My only problem is I did want to order another hammock , but without the stand and I never got an answer on that question. The hammock is sturdy and comfortable and nicely priced. Wish I could order another one without the stand.
5	There were three sizes of screen in this package, which is nice because not all drains are the same size. Also, there were two of the smaller sized screens and I use those the most. Very happy with this purchase!! My sister saw them and ordered a bunch for her house as well!
5	This watch is beautiful. I liked it.
5	This product is very portable and does the job. I needed one before real winter starts here in chicago.I can carry this air compressor in my car and use it whenever needed. Its a good product to have in your car.
5	Really love this coffee mug, I wish they had more themed coffee cups with this level of detail
5	ALL I can say is like it
5	The bands work great and I like the different colors which make the Fitbit more versatile. I wear my Fitbit all the time so I am able to change the band to coordinate with what I am wearing. Great price and made very well. I have had mine for about 2 months now and have had no problems. Received the item in a timely manner!!
5	Just the same as sold in Office Depot only half the price for EXACT same package.
5	Exactly what I wanted to get for my brother. He LOVES it. He said his water with ice stay cold for so long.
5	Works great have recommend to friends, use it all the time.
5	This story was simply captivating. I could not put it down. This is my first read from this author and it will not be my last. It's a modern day kinky Camelot and I loved it!!!!!!
5	Will buy more like the feel of handle and many Mua use this brand
5	Awesome way to enjoy a glass of your favorite bourbon. The shape does help aerate the bourbon
5	Very good for people with lots of hair . Was able to put up a bun and the cap still worked
5	Stopped high eye pressure. Doctor made it sound like it was not possible but this product cut my eye pressure in half.
5	Helped get rid of musty odor from old filter. Works great!
5	These fit my small decker and black wireless vacuum well. And the price is good. Will buy again when out of usage.
5	It has flaps that go over your hands to imitate flippers. A nice surprise!
5	I am not a fan of , they are over priced and overrated. That being said, these headphones are awesome! They pair effortlessly, they sound good, and so far have a great battery life. Being able to charge them with the same cord as my phone is great.
5	I bought it to connect dell monitor to my mac. It works great. Connected it to my 4K TV and amazing pixel quality. Great deal!
5	These mats are well-made, fluffy and fun for the dogs!
5	Quality and fast shipping Thank You
5	Beautiful, however was not the right color for me. I am purchasing another one in a different color.
5	Seems to be working for some digestive issues such as reflux or indigestion.
5	Replaced a 13 yr rack -- I feel this newer layout can fit more smaller bowls and saucers.
5	We originally bought these almost ten years when our youngest was playing sports and they saved our backs when we sat on bleachers a lot. We lost one recently so time for a new pair. So happy to find them on Amazon! We cover them with nice material with a velcro closure so we can take off and wash. The best cushion you can find.
5	I love this light! It is perfect for my nursery. It also gives off great light for the midnight feedings.
5	My first Superman cape! Fits great. Excellent quality. Wore it on top of Pulpit Rock in Norway and got many complements about it! Highly recommended!
5	Really like this case. Fits perfect and seems to be of good quality. Perfect for protection whilst still looking clean and classic. Great case.
5	Bought these for a senior adult Valentine party and they worked great. Good quality and easy to use.
5	Colors are accurate, just the paint peels eventually
5	Great price & love the cover!
5	Perfect size. Does its job as advertised. No odor, good pocket size.
5	This planner saved my life! It’s pretty basic but it’s not too big or small and looks sleek as hell, a little on the feline side which I love cuz I’m gay but it might be too much for the common Hetero man
5	Ranch with no dairy! And it tastes just like ranch! YAY!
5	I love this book light! I ordered this for my son, who is 9; we read books each evening before bedtime. My daughter, who is 6, also loved it, so I ordered one for her as well (only in white). All 3 of us love the touch feature and that there are three different lighting options. The best feature ~ USB Rechargeable!!!!
5	These are very handy! Each marker has the same color but one end is more of a thicker marker but as big as a regular marking pen. The other is a fine tip marker for doing more detailed work. Great for adult coloring books or anywhere you would need a fine point or a marker not as thick as the regular ones.
5	Great sticker. Good quality.
5	Love this milestone blanket. Super cute and was amazing for pictures!
5	Exactly as ordered. Delivered as promised.
5	Good quality and not difficult to install. The instructions state to trim close as possible to the graphic as possible. If you don't their are certain places that will cause a problem. IE: around the door licks and mirror
5	Great movie for my collection! Fast shipment!
5	I bought this knife December 2018 and has been great thus far. The only downside is that the clip used to attached the knife to a pocket or belt is held by 3 small screws. With time and the weight of the knife one of the screws stripped and no longer held the clip in place. I remedied this issue with a drop of gorilla glue. Now it doesnt move and holds the clip and the knife in place.
5	My kids are spoiled. They have tried a variety of Mac n cheese but this is the only one they will actually eat. I’m grateful we can order it now bc we live 2.5 hours away from WF. I mix in chicken, broccoli and mushrooms with zero complaints from my elementary age kiddos. Good luck out there in the world of feeding the cruelest of critics
5	Love these leggings. The fit is great, they hold in your tummy without it being uncomfortable at all. I wear them mostly lounging around the house or running errands, so can't comment on the workout aspect. For sizing reference: I'm a size 12 and typically an L/XL in leggings, got the L in these and they fit perfectly. Planning to order more soon.
5	This one is Thomas's story. It captures his heart and love for family n his lady love. Worth the buy.
5	Works like it is suppose to.
5	We have found that this tea makes great, refreshing sun tea in the hot summer temperatures!!!!
5	Love this dish rack! It is so easy to fold and unfold. It's sturdy and the perfect size. Big enough to fit some items but not so big that it takes up all the space on the counter. Use it everyday and still in good condition. Is slim when folded and put away.
5	LOVE IT! fantastic style, easy to put together and long term abuse from 3 year old shows the strength of the finish. Very happy with this purchase, internal storage is fantastic and I would buy again.
5	Love this calendar. I need one with pockets for all the appt cards. Pretty colorful print.
5	Fit great my daughter loves it!!
5	Love this humidifier. It's nice looking, easy to use, makes no noise, and the night light is very subtle. I bought a 2nd one for my daughter and I'm going to buy my niece one too
5	Bought for a grands kareoke party and they worked perfectly for what we needed. Very bright and 2 was plenty
5	The set is beautiful and sturdy. Very comfortable seating and the blue color is pretty. There is a lot of nuts and screws involved in the assembly. We used a power tool to assemble. We had no trouble putting the pieces together. It took us two hours to get it altogether, when done it will have been all worth it.
5	This little box provides with different soothing sounds which will aid you to sleep better at night. As soon as it arrived, my wife and I used the soothing rain option sound and we both fell asleep immediately. We've never had a night since then where we're either annoyed or tired by the sounds. A perfect companion for those who want to have a good night sleep by listening to natural sounds and for those who work at night and would like to drown any noise to sleep through the day!
5	This is my first slim wallet after 20+ years with the bifold and trifold types. I always find it so funny though checking to see that I have it in my pocket since it don't have any bulk to it. I really like it and its fits all my important cards and IDs and more than enough cash.
5	Great quality feel. Small bag great for transportation drivers. Hold more than I thought neatly and on body securely.
5	I just received the cheetah bathing suit in the mail and WOW i am shocked. First off the quality is amazing especially for the price, it looks so high end. And it fits me perfectly. I have such a hard time finding bathing suits, i never normally like any on me, but this one is just so flattering and i am so happy. I am normally a XS, S in bathing suit bottoms and the small fits perfect. And i am normally a medium in tops but i got the small and it fits a little snug, but nothing bad i am still going to wear it. 10/10 recommend and going to buy a few more because i love it so much.
5	Well made, very easy to apply and very reasonable price. Worked better than more expensive products.
5	Just what I wanted and actually the right size
5	I have been looking for a bike bag in order to have my phone available, water bottles, and to store just a few things. This bag came with 3 velcro straps, securing it without jostling as I ride. THe others I looked at were more expensive and didn't have this feature. The "cone" down makes it compact instead of a large " box" on the front. Aesthetically attractive!! I HIGHLY recommend this product. Almost forgot, the clear pouch at the top is great for maps, seeing calls, and let's not forget the safety - hard to steal, makes it available for calls in case of an emergency, just a very handy feature
5	Great product. I was not disappointed at all.
5	Nice Product and quick delivery!
5	This product work great. I have been giving these to my dog for a few months now and he barley sheds. He loves getting them every morning as a treat. They work wonderful and it is such a great price for them.
5	Very compact & I like that.
5	My wife picked this one for her and my daughter. She loves the color and style. It normally tooked her about 10 mins to dry her long hair for both medium and high heat. Works great so far. Hope this one last longer than her old one. She likes it so far.
5	This works really well if you have a lot of debris in your pool . Easy to empty as well. Love it.
5	I watched this cartoon when I was a kid it is still a good cartoon
5	This is one of my top three things I recommend to all new moms. This book is truly AMAZING. I am not a cook as my husband does most of our meals. When I do help in the kitchen I have to follow a recipe to the letter. This book was beyond perfect. It lays out your shopping list, it says while this is cooking on the stove, defrost this in the microwave, and work on chopping this. I followed every step as it is laid out except instead of one 3hr session I did two hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday. Instead of molds, I used breast milk bags to store all of my prepared baby food and let them lay flat to freeze. Then the book also has the meal plan laid out so I didn't have to do any thinking there either. It shows which food to introduce which day and all I had to do was check that schedule and then have what I needed for the next day in the fridge to defrost so that I could just grab a baggie, pour it into a bowl, and heat it up! Traveling was also a non-issue as I didn't have to rely on storebought baby food. I could just put my baggies in a travel cooler and have what we needed at the ready. If I wasn't going to be able to heat it through I just swapped out for things that were okay to eat cold or at room temperatures like apple puree or pear puree. I'm telling you, this book could be titled how to introduce foods and prepare all of your baby food for dummies. I'm so grateful to the author. Everyone who wants to make baby food NEEDS this book!
5	Took about 10 mins to install, and so far so good.. wish it would have came with replacement rivet, but I bought some anyhow.
5	When I first bought these headphones the buttons on the cable didn't work. I contacted the company not expecting a reply however within the day I had received an email to say that I they were sorry I was having issues with their product and that they were sending another pair in the post. I am happy to say that pair arrived, the buttons work and I now have a fabulous set of headphones that deals with the bass of the music I listen to fabulously!
5	I've been looking for a budget friendly smartwatch and this one hit the spot. It amazes me how a small device can bring so much convenience. The dial and messaging functions really well. Just make sure to connect your smartwatch to your phone thru bluetooth and everything will sync up.
5	That I used for several days and they worked quite well but these headphones are vastly superior. The amount of volume control on these is very precise as opposed to other products. They are vastly more well built as well. The ear pieces are slim enough to accomodate all but the thickest rifle gun stocks. The clarity of voices that can be heard is terrific given the ability to suppress loud gun reports. Buy with confidence, these really work well!
5	This part repaired our 35 year old aquarium filter for a fraction of what a new filter assembly would have cost. A snap to install.
5	My husband purchased these first and I loved them so much I bought a pair for myself but I’m a different color. Lol. We wore them on our honeymoon. They were perfect!
5	Nice folding chess board for the price. Upon receiving the board, a rook was missing. I mentioned it to customer service and they immediately sent me a new piece. Great service.
5	Really nice item, great value
5	I loved this dress..it fits beautifully...sewed well and very comfortable...
5	Very Nice Poster! Fast Delivery!
5	They look a bit different than the originals off of our 2002 model chair but they have the same build quality. I like the replacement arm rest looks better than the originals.
5	high quality for such a low price, durable.
5	Very good product and recommend it!!
5	good i mean its a sharpie cant complain
5	Bought for grandchildren for elementary school .. they enjoy coloring with them
5	Can’t wait until the next book, always a great cliffhanger at the end. Would highly recommend this series and the I am number 4 series.
5	Great driving gloves
5	Love it and price was right!
5	Great sturdy umbrella. Just what my daughter was looking for.
5	Very nice watch band. The color wasn’t as quite as light as it appeared to be in the photo, but overall I’m happy for the price I paid. Feels like a good quality.
5	Looks sturdy. Works great.
5	bought this for a 12 hour car ride and it worked perfectly the entire time and has worked perfectly in everyday life. Highly recommend
5	The Kids really enjoy them.
5	So well written, exciting, incredibly sad, scary, a roller coaster ride of words and emotions and action. Just get it and read it.
5	this is such a nice sweater. I have gotten in black and gray, it is thick and warm and perfectly fitted.
5	Great purchase! Durable, thick, excellent quality. Have washed it 6 times now and still holds color and quality.
5	Really comfortable. Fits true to size.
5	It's a good phone for the price. Thanks.
5	I would like to see more all in one package, having to order a little here and there.
5	Great quality, exactly what I expected no complaints.
5	This DVD is on repeat! My 3 yr old loves both movies very much and watches them in the car and it calms her down.
5	I thought about only buying on pry bar but I like this set and it’s really nice having different sizes for working on cars.
5	This would not fit anyone who has a muscle mass. It is pretty sturdy and narrow range adjustable. However, I can imagine that if one flexes their arm naturally, it may hurt. The snake bracelet didnt fit me, so I had to return it to the seller. The return was free and easy.
5	These wedges are every bit as good as one's you would pay $$$$ for
5	Lots of fun as gifts, I gave bunches of them away and everyone loved them. Make great party favors also.
5	Solid bit piece. 2 inch ball is perfect size for hamstrings / quads and chest / shoulders.
5	I love it! Works perfectly for my daughters bottles!
5	used for our web orders fulfillment. appreciated by our consumers
5	I cant say enough good things I love the sunglasses . So cute on . Pretty and girly just what I wanted ..
5	Large in size with plenty of space for various candies/snacks/toys/etc. The favor bags have vibrant colors as pictured in the listing. The item is exactly as described and everyone has said how adorable they are! Reasonable price and fast shipping. Highly recommended!
5	great looking product
5	It’s very cute and soft but I haven’t used it yet because the winter doesn’t start in my state yet
5	When I opened this at work I was so happy with what my four year grandson would be receiving. It is made of the the appearance of the puppet. It gives you the ability to Use the hand dowel or without as its attached to Velcro
5	The data line quality is good, the screen is very clear, the design is very easy to clean up
5	This product keeps my hands warn and feels nice to wear so I am happy with these gloves.
5	Great book...many great recipes were made in easy steps...like to cook after reading this..many author explained step by step in clear wording..smoking meat is one of my favourite book..
5	I loved this story! Her heroines are so very real. It reminded me that we all need to appreciate our loved ones!
5	These crochet hooks are the absolute best for comfort and ease of use. I can't recommend them highly enough.
5	I love these bags so much! They are adorable colors and carry a lot of weight. They seem like they will last a long time.
5	I own dogs, and they run all over the house and pee sometimes on my floors. However, this product was great for removing it! It completely gets rid of the stain and cleans it perfectly. I also use it to steam other products, and this cleaner offers great value for its price. I recommend this product to anyone considering it!
5	This book makes me feel a little better when I look at my own stocks
5	Loved it works great, highly recommend!
5	Exactly as described. Small and modular. Fits easily in a locker or bag. Dual action pump works fast. Easily pumped up my new soccer ball.
5	I was super nervous about buying this. This tracker has been amazing so far! Tracks my sleep ! My steps! My pulse! I absolutely love it. And I can read my messages as well. Will definitely recommend this to my friends and family. It doesn't come with a charger is the only downside. But buy yourself a usb plug charger.
5	I liked the color, and the way they looked on my ears. Very elegant
5	Couldn’t find these anywhere so perfect for my jigsaw
5	These are great headphones with great sound quality. They fit right of my ears and they are very low profile that I forgot that i have them on sometimes. I use these for work so I don't disturb anybody around me. You can still have hear mostly what is going on around you like ambient noise while still experiencing good audio from the headset. Battery life is only good for a couple of hours, maybe a little more.
5	I get compliments on this case all the time, especially paired with a matching pop socket. I’ve had this case about 6 months and it has held up very well. I dropped my phone today so hard it bounced, and luckily doesn’t have a scratch.
5	Love these sandals. Fit great and offer good support!
5	Wow. So excited with this product. Easy setup got 30 plus channels. Good quality reception in our RV in our remote campsite!
5	My husband loves these shoes. So comfortable. I ordered my son a pair.
5	Good quality product
5	This is a great set of pajamas. I really like the colors, as they are a bit more unique than what you see everywhere else. Baby girl seems to be very comfortable in them as well. Size runs normal.
5	Have read them all and look forward to the next
5	Great product, super fast delivery. Very happy
5	This is such a pretty diffuser! The colors are vibrant and cycle nicely. I haven't left it on for the full 3 hour timer to see how far the reservoir goes yet. Came in a nice silver box that would make it good enough to gift it in. Glad I finally got one.
5	Nice set. I find more uses as I go.
5	Love this very large umbrella. It is so well made. I like the fact that it tilts. Great find, well constructed and adds elegance to my patio set.
5	i have definite regrowth. of course, it's baby fine and thin wisps, but hey-- beats bald spots!!!
5	Helps distinguish who's leap pad is who's!
5	Cute and handy, I keep mine in my purse.
5	A must have for cupcakes, mess free
5	It made my plain old key fob look classy and expensive. It looks very much like it is part of the key fob and not something I put on. Very happy with this one.
5	Fits good and looks great! No complaints.
5	Making labels is fun
5	Super wicking, hair is dry in no time!
5	Functions perfectly fine so far. Good quality and arrived on time.
5	PT door pulley is great for increasing overhead range of motion of the shoulder & arms.
5	I love the product. I was able to put it together in two days.
5	I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them. He said they're already his favorite pair!
5	Great movies although some do not show a movie title but go directly to the movie and no commercials
5	Love these! Never get tired of them. They form to my feet perfectly.
5	Easy to install. Great price.
5	Easy to use. It also has four different heads for four differnet functions which is pretty cool and I like that. You cna easily switch the heads for big or small blackheads and another is to firm the skin and the fourth one is to minimize the pores which I need that. Overall pretty nice product and it is wireless too and not batteries operated. You just charge it and bring it anywhere with you.
5	This is our second Netvue camera, first was a indoor one, the picture quality and voice are perfect. It’s super easy to install and customer service is great if you have any question on the product. Love it so much getting 3 more as Christmas gifts.
5	BPA free water bottle that has a build in handle, with marks to indicate and encourage you to drink water throughout the day, and comes in a multitude of colors- couldnt ask for anything more.
5	Great chocolate flavor without the added sugar. Only complaint is shipping takes a while
5	This hanger can install behind the door, very convenient and does not take up space. You can hang things that are not commonly used, or something like hats and scarves. By the way, you need to make sure that your gap is enough for this hanger.
5	Box was worn down,but shoe is perfect and fit just right
5	Great product and lots of uses around the farm and house.
5	Daughter loved this for Halloween costume. Love the headband
5	Bought as a gift for a friend. They really like it.
5	A complete list of great plugins for those who want to be up and beyond other sites.
5	This is my favorite. I get a lot of compliments and it lasts a long time. The cost is very reasonable. JoAnna Fleek
5	I bought the brown passport for my husband and the blue passport for myself and love them. The brown is very rich in color and so is the blue. These are a very good buy!
5	Material/product is soft and is as shown.
5	I was super happy to get this dress. The blue color is very pretty. Kind of a Smokey blue. The fabric feels great on and I really like the way it hangs on me. This dress is super comfy to wear and I will be able to dress it up or dress it down depending on the occasion. I highly recommend this dress.
5	Have been using it for a month and love it. Was really easy to install (only took 10-15 minutes)
5	My dog (and cat) love these treats!!
5	I like the bread pan
5	I purchase this Dual USB Wall Charger because I needed it in my bathroom to plug in my LED USB Mirrors without take up another outlet. It served the purpose very well and I am very happy with it. No more will I have to switch cables. This is a great product.
5	I was excited to have the opportunity to preview this book and look forward to using my slow cooker more often. I really like that this book has recipes that I have not seen elsewhere and not just your standard pulled pork, chili and soup recipes. There is a section for breakfast – something I had not thought about using my slow cooker for. The recipes are creative and healthy. The author includes variation tips with each recipe and the ingredients are easy to source. There is a section with vegetarian recipes and a section with simple sides at the end of the book.
5	loves these. comfortable and cool. the best
5	Got this one for my son.he is in love.they are super comfortable and lightweight.the wool inside is extremely warm.
5	They are perfect! They match everything and are very helpful in locating keys and such!
5	Absolutely wonderful. I was hesitant about the price and the thread count initially but completely satisfied. Definitely ordering more
5	Convenient to take to work
5	Received the vest today... fits to size, comfortable, designed/does what it is supposed to do and has a lot of pockets!!!!
5	love this! it is slightly too small. but our baby is 1 so it's not an issue. The covering sheet is actually waterproof, so when he spills milk it doesn't ruin the foam mattress.
5	I’ve had these lights for about 4 months now. They where very easy to install and look great! I haven’t had any problems with the lights. I have recently lost the remote and contacted their customer service where I was helped by a very nice lady! If I got another car I would definitely bye these again! The only con is the remote can be easy to lose if you often misplace stuff.
5	Fast shipment! Lot’s of color option! And very sticky.
5	This is an awesome LED smart desk lamp. Because it's slim and doesn’t take up much room, I bought it for the narrow cabinet space next to my sewing machine. However, after using it a while, now I'd like to clone it for use in other parts of my house! It has multiple choices -- bright white, white and a nice off white. I use the bright white during the day and the off-white is better for working in the evening. The brightness is adjustable by just touching the level button, which I can use as the sunshine or lack thereof outside my window changes. It has a USB port, which is AMAZING and perfect for keeping my smartphone charged. It even has a timer feature I can touch before leaving my sewing area in case I get tied up elsewhere and can't come back to it right away. I appreciate how easy it is to adjust where you want that light to shine by just moving the top piece. The cord is also quite long reaching a good distance.
5	So far is working great now that we have camper back from all the repairs.
5	When I opened the package, I immediately fell in love with this set of kitchenware. It is more beautiful than the picture. Black nylon with silver stainless steel, simple but never going out of date. I haven't used it. I gave it 5 stars for this appearance.
5	Work great and a great value.
5	I bought this for my 88 year old mother because she wanted it to improve her vision. The pharmacist had recommended orange flavor and i bought this never having used this product. My mother says it is wonderful. It is like taking a teaspoon of water, but thicker. She said there is no aftertaste and no burping so she is very satisfied. I will probably order a bottle for myself!
5	So adorable, and looked great on the Barefoot brand wine bottles.
5	Can't go wrong with this purchase
5	I would purchase again for family if I needed to. Nice qualiy
5	Very hot and with a touch of sweetness I love it.
5	Nothing to dislike, just fine
5	ended up not using the pads that came with it but works well, easy to use
5	This bag is awesome...perfect for what I need day to day and would be a GREAT bug out bag 2nd option because you can carry it up front while carrying a bigger backpack if needed. Lots of options for add-ons also. Thoroughly impressed. Thanks Red Rock!!!
5	Nothing to dislike, it is handsome, soft, light and easy to clean.
5	Half the cost of buying at the big box store. Great quality.
5	It very good, me like very a lot, it play good in my sound holes
5	excellent shipping item was just as expected works great. Thank you
5	Work great, nice set of back up headphones for friends for those long car rides.
5	Work well great and cheap.
5	I thought the book was good, it had romance and excitement which a reader loves. The main character was a woman who was cheated out of money and a good life by her deceased selfish husband who gave all his money to his children by his first wife and left her with little. She was a strong willed woman who showed she can survive found a place to live and a job and a man to love.
5	Great book to give as a gift to young families starting out.
5	This mirror is great! The light is super bright perfect for putting on makeup. Small enough to take with you or store in a drawer. It only takes 3AAA battery's. You will see all your imperfections in this mirror. That's how closeup is.
5	I'm sure my son's teacher will love it.
5	Great cover fits perfect
5	This item is a gift for a 3 year old. Looking at the item it seems to be ok. Will not really know how it works. I am hoping it is fine. for the little one.
5	Great little set of tools for the kitchen. First off, excellent for making salsa. The grater and slicer also come in handy. Use the included recipe book as a place to start for salsa then try if for other stuff. Oh, and its unbelievably eco friendly.
5	loved this book, reading the second one now
5	These are really good for blacking out the light from coming into our bedrooms. With street lights out side these curtains s have worked great taking care of not letting the light into the rooms.
5	Very attractive in color and good in size. It completely matches with the bathroom accessories you see when you search for this on amazon.
5	The pan is perfect - no problem with sticking.
5	I love this beanie! The quality and sound are top notch. Bonus, it’s nice and soft as well.
5	Very cute and good quality
5	My Daughter Loved it
5	Just opened the box up, and it paired easily with my Lenovo Tab4 10.1 tablet (Android 7, 2017 model). Its size works well with a 10" tablet--see attached photo. So far, so good 10 minutes after setting it up. Will update review as I get more experience with it.
5	All the emotions. Great story that was fun to watch and original.
5	I would recommend to family and friends.
5	Good-looking bowl, good quality, used to hold rice, just the right size, eat with such a beautiful bowl, I feel that I will eat two bowls of rice. I really like this bowl.
5	Bought a 3T and a 12 for my sons and they fit perfectly (my oldest typically wears a 10/12 in shirts). Really great material and looks amazing on them
5	I really loved this book .Lynn Austin is one of my favorite Christian author's. You won't want to put this book down.
5	Good quality and good size for candy bags
5	My husband makes a Halloween trail every year and we are always looking for something new to make it more exciting for the little kids! These lights light up the trees in the ground and make it look really small gam my husband makes a Halloween trail every year and we are always looking for something new to make it more exciting for the little kids! These lights light up the trees in the ground and make it look really Spooky!
5	I love my Aroma essential diffuser! Its easy to assemble, just take off the top,add water and essential oil and turn it on. The Mist button has 5 different time operations and also changes to 7 different colors that lights up my room.It really helps with my allergies! I have it next to me while I'm sleep and it clears my nasal passages! I can actually breathe better at night.Its small and very quiet.you can smell the aroma in the air.
5	It was very easy to put on the wall as it came with the screws and dry wall anchors, and works well for my ukulele. The materials do feel a bit cheap, but it holds up well.
5	Great quality and fits perfectly
5	Good basic carry on that meets the newer, smaller personal items on the budget carriers. Knick-knacks toiletry back-ups nylon jacket,etc and a tablet or magazines, book, caps and more versatile than a single strap sling bag.
5	just like Zyrtec but much more reasonable in pricing
5	This was a great deal
5	This is exactly what I was looking for in plastic. They do a real good job. They come Well packaged and individually wrapped too. I tried these looking into my mouth and teeth with the help of a mini-mag light and was pleasantly surprised on how the little mirrors were so clear. I am sold. Thanks
5	Great product! Helped me out greatly at my last concert! will definitely be buying more from this seller!
5	This electric nail drill set is perfect. It comes with everything you can imagine needing. Every once in awhile I do my own nails at home, so I needed a good set of tools to prepare my nails and this was inexpensive, but is perfect. It has the tools to file, sand, polish, clip your cuticles and more.
5	Definitely protects phone good , still haven’t broke my screen after dropping several times
5	I love these. They don't spill easily. Only through the straw. However, when you refill, you have to take the straw out before putting on the lid, the suction makes the liquid come out of the straw.
5	This is one of the best things I ever bought. It saves me so much time from hand squeezing and even catches the seeds. A+++
5	My Granddaughters second pair in a larger size! We love these Minnie Mouse slippers!
5	This product works seamlessly! I have struggled with loss of connections, wi-fi extenders, slow gaming, etc.. but this has solved all our connectivity woes.
5	This bible is great.
5	The only thing I dislike about about this waters the UV light is kind of bright at night. It is quiet and pumps well.
5	This is a beautiful necklace. Wear it often!!!!
5	Daughter loves it. I love it
5	MARILYN IS TIMELESS AND THIS POSTER IS GREAT
5	Well made easy to adjust
5	I have to say, I am extremely impressed!! Not at all what I expected, to be honest. It’s very, very nice with an almost satin-like finish. Highly recommend. I will definitely be a repeat customer!
5	Really well made and very durable, made from metal and has 5 hdmi slot, has a dc slot to for extra power(?). Cause it works fine with just one HDMI output and one HDMI input. Switch/button works and remote doesn't have any delay. The LED blue light isn't overly bright either so useful and not blindingly bright at night.
5	Awesome product for the money
5	Have only used black cartridge but works great. Looks same as HP ink. Printer keeps alerting that not using HP ink but have not had any problems as far as printing documents.
5	They are great fast shipping.
5	Great book...really many tasty recipes are there in this book..which keeps you fit and healthy..I like this helpful guide very much..author explained very well..highly recommended
5	These smell so good! They are great to use in diffusers and just on your skin. I like to use coconut oil to kind of dilute it. They work well and you get a good variety. Definitely recommend!
5	These help a sick stomach a LOT! My dad has chronic pancreatitis and is very often (daily) nauseous. This is a must-have in our house.
5	Love this skirt!! I received lots of complements on it. It fit well and I love that it has pockets in it. I will be ordering more in more colors! If your looking for the perfect midi skirt, this is the one!
5	Works great :D Love them!
5	Love it! Perfect almost with good fragrance, concealable and in great quantity for the price.
5	Very comfortable band. Best features are the double clasp and the feature that you can make dinner adjustments on the clasp for a perfect fit Nice addition including a tool for the band. Overall very nice.
5	These are very high quality ethernet cables. I'm very pleased.
5	Love the design and cotton material! Trying it out soon on an airplane. Yes people stare when I wear a mask on a plane. So excited to rock these.
5	Easy to use simply wet, wring it out and it helps to cool.I like these.I wear it around my neck every time I work outside. Sometimes when it's hot outside, I wear it on my head in case of direct sunlight.
5	I love how the table feels with this on it!
5	This product has very good quality and the price is really reasonable for this. It really help me when I try to wash my car and the backyard.
5	I've tried a few different whitening products which are not only quite pricey but don't actually give me any results and on top of that are full of chemicals; after only a week of using this product I've definitely noticed my teeth to be whiter, not that much but for the price and for the time it is worth trying it. I would recommend it.
5	Very nice sign, love it
5	The part your baby lays on has a layer of thin foam that makes it comfortable for the baby. It’s also really nice that it has straps and makes it really easy to grab and run into the store with so you can leave the diaper bag behind.
5	Such a great little tuner! I really love the fact that you can tune based on capo positioning. Such a tight fit on the head :)
5	It is the best quality and really worth it
5	Bought this for my wife's birthday. She said she wanted a simple Gold cross that would not rust. She's worn it 24/7 since I gave it to her back in October and it is still as shiny as the day I gave it to her. It does not rust, change colors, or cause any rashes for her.
5	I love this Saucony shoe - very comfortable G
5	Really good construction, not the usually cheap plastic feel. I love the multiple colors on each truck. The return mechanism is really nice and fun. It's a must buy for every child!
5	Finally connected. Crappy wireless service and a crappy USB plugin antenna. LAN works so well and I am sooooo happy with this cable.
5	grandson enjoyed this book
5	Direct replacement for my walker seat.
5	I love this battery would buy another
5	Very smart stuff. I’ve tried orange, blueberries and my baby so enjoyed using that
5	I wrote about this wrong article thinking it was another similar one that I bought weeks ago and it came out bad. This on the contrary I just started using it and it looks much better quality. I love
5	Figured they needed assembled. But pretty easy! And good size for party favors.... and really really cute!!!! Kids loved walking out with them after party!!! We were super pleased!
5	Great screen protector. Saved my screen more than once.
5	Great Customer Service! Thank you...
5	Enjoyed characters and story line. I have downloaded the others in series. I do not think I will be disappointed. Series is worth reading. Thank you for sharing your gift 😊
5	This is my first camcorder, very exciting. I have never use one, but it is really easy to set. After I followed the instructions in the manual, it's all set and ready to use. It supplied with 2 batteries, and the camera supports recording while charging. I had been recorded some video clips approximately 1.5 hours in total plus some photos as well. It supported up to 32GB SD card, which is far than enough for my own use, however, I wish it can support more capacity so I can keep more image in a single card. I haven't used it for a week since my holiday when I switched it on today, the battery still has 3 bars. Overall this is a good camcorder for those who don't want to spend a fortune like me.
5	I like that the color can be extra small and extra large to fit all stages. I do not use the shocking component but the beep and the vibration mode are enough to distract my dog from what she is doing that needs correction. The double charger is really nice! So far I've only had to charge the collar and remote once.
5	Have had neck pain for some time, unable to find the right pillow. This is it!
5	I spend a lot of time in my car, so this is a nice way to use my essential oils daily. I love that I can switch out the scents for when I’m working (something motivating) to something calming (for when the kiddos are in the car). I also love that it’s another way I am able to gain the benefits of essential oils in my life.
5	Following retinal surgery (for a detached retina) and subsequent cataract surgery, I experienced eye strain when reading. Systane Complete provided near immediate relief of my eye-strain. While Systane Ultra is great for my general dry-eye condition (in both eyes), Systane Complete really worked in relieving eye strain in my primarily affected eye .
5	This game is so fun! And portable! Fits in a small purse!
5	Use this in your Honda to protect engine block and water pump from corrosion. Expensive but well worth it in long run.
5	Another excellent book by this author. It's not morbid or icky-just states the facts. Great for young readers (I wouldn't go below 13 though, just because it's not ...oh...easy to read? Not because of subject matter, but because it is written in an adult voice...she doesn't dumb it down.) I am planning to buy several more for Christmas gifts.
5	Good price good fit very pleased
5	too big and really goofy looking
5	Great for travel in Middle East
5	I plan to purchase more from this company. The scarf is beautiful and well made. I received the scarf quickly and am very happy it.
5	I ordered these for a committee I'm on at work and they are the perfect size.
5	As I expected. Great pan. I've always wanted a pan similar to the one my mother used when I was a child. Hopefully I will be able to produce meals as tasty as the ones she did. The first steaks came out very good.
5	These pins are perfect for embroidery, small, sharp and love the glass ball ends.
5	What a great watchband. It's not only stylish and beautiful, it's really easy to fit to desired size and install on the Apple Watch. And my wife LOVES it!
5	These are very comfy and warm they are great for the money.
5	My kids and grandkids love this item. It is a good transport for sports, picnics, camping, and more for this active family. Th quality of this product is very high; it folds and stores very nicely.
5	These flowers are bright and look real which I loved and price is great. You can do alot with them and will be purchasing another pack just to have 😁
5	Arrived on time and as promised.
5	I bought this because the large coils on our antique stovetop quit working. My wife has used this daily for a year and loves that it is portable. It gets the job done for large pots and heats quickly.
5	This was a very cute costume for our 1.5 yr old. The shell easily Velcro’s with a belt which was great for getting in the car seat.
5	Awesome album and songs. Love this guy and his wife on back up vocals. Lots of soul in the music.
5	Beautiful color! Wonderful fit! No, they're not SUPER-soft--but definitely soft enough. Just like the percale sheets I remember from my youth, they've a 'crisp' finish & don't make me sweat. They might soften the more they're washed, but I love them now, having been washed only once. Amy wrinkles flatten out when put on the breed. And they even fit my mattress pocket!
5	Totally worth the money. I love them
5	100% fit to my Dekor Classic pail, at an unbelievable price! I was initially concerned that these wouldn't fit but decided to give it a shot and I am glad I did. They fit perfectly! I recommend these to anyone with a Dekor classic pail
5	This is a novelty book to keep with the Harry Potter series on your bookshelf. It is referenced in the series and makes a nice addition to the collection. My kids have commented how cool the presentation of this book is, from cover to pages.
5	I love these headphones. They sync easily with my phone. No static. I love that the headphones are adjustable. Very comfortable.
5	Love the durability. Please make this cover in a pale pink!
5	Spoon the rice mixture into the mushrooms. Pour in the broth, seal the lid and cook on High pressure for 10 minutes, Do a quick release. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve immediately.
5	Went hiking in red rock canyon! These insoles working great! Nice support in hiking shoes...
5	Very useful, our family has 4 car keys, we always can't find it immediately. Since we use this product, we can find the keys quickly. Very convenient. The product has key rings, can't lose the keys anymore.
5	Love the harness.Its been hard finding one that fit. My Chihuahua, Spike is happy. Thanks
5	sounds almost too realistic to politics today
5	Great product for the money. Super flat and the packaging was good too. Shipping took a few days but that's expected when It weighs 40 pounds.
5	I love Eden's novels and highly recommend them as good clean romances. Well done! Can't wait for the next one!
5	Nice and sturdy, fixed my tight neck!
5	My son loved it for his keyboard.
5	Great Stuff! Definitely worth trying.
5	Love how it's all natural with not too many ingredients. Calendula and coconut water were the reasons why I bought this! The scent is a bit strong - but it wears off pretty quick. It stings a bit at first too but again stops pretty quick - so perhaps not for the ultra sensitive skin. There is no redness however and it feels very moisturizing. Also very good value - the bottle will last me forever. :D UPDATE: After I used this for a few days I love this even more! Makes you glow, very moisturizing and helps with pore congestion!
5	Good price, and working well on my bike.
5	These earrings are darling and so lightweight! They go with so many different outfits and are just the right size! I absolutely love them!
5	This is definitely the best pillow I have ever own. It’s vary soft and the material is excellent. This pillow doesn’t go flat down like others I have had. It just as the high hotel have. I sleep vary comfortable and the pillow adjust with my head. I totally highly recommend.
5	loved this when it worked but after a few times it is no longer working at all. Will attempt to get a replacement.
5	Its velvety soft !! Double sided like it says which is very helpful!!
5	I would recommend this stand to all of my Apple Watch using friends. Especially for the price. Inexpensive but not cheap looking. The base is absolutely stable and sturdy. Easy assembly. It’s just Perfect.
5	This was perfect and works great! I have cabinets over my counters so being able to control where the steam goes will save them from damage. Bought this for my ultra and fit was perfect!
5	Love it. Can't even tell I have a screen protector on.
5	Product is as described. It’s easy to use and I notified a difference after just 2 uses.
5	I really like the softness, I have had others, but these are the best.
5	Great audio quality for the price!
5	These are incredibly soft. I use them for my children and they actually like them as is, so I don’t bother putting a second case over it. The zipper is tiny, but strong. Great product.
5	Works well. No need for lighter fluid anymore.
5	I very rarely leave a review - but this product is so stellar I felt compelled. I have fine, thin hair. Almost every other type of roller damages my hair causing it to break off. These rollers have a plastic core that makes them more rigid than any other foam roller - so they make the rolling up part much easier as they hold their shape and don't compress. I do not use the black self lock bar because it puts a "dent" in my hair. I use the thin clips/pins from my old hot rollers. They slide easily over the roller and hold it in place. If I need more clips I order these: Pro Touch Assorted Hot Roller Clips, 12 Count. I half way dry my hair and then use the rollers. If it gets too dry I spritz with water. Then I use the blow dryer to dry each roller. I put on my makeup, get dressed and then they are dry and I take them out and have firm, long lasting curls. BTW, i do use gel on my wet hair. I often sleep on my hair (no rollers) and it still looks good the 2nd day! I have short - medium length hair.
5	Love them all. Very pretty and great quality
5	Got it for my friend and he love it!
5	I bought this for my 2 year old and she absolutely loves it! The stainless steel makes it a realistic-looking tea set and is great for imaginative play. She sits at her table and chairs and has a tea party. The cost is very reasonable compared to the quality! Very happy with this purchase!
5	Great quality - I make green smoothies for my 3 year old in this, and he sucks them down. Only wish it was easier to clean, tiny smoothie remnants in the straw valve no matter what I do.
5	Love this book! In addition to the fact that it has extraordinary recipes, yet it additionally separates the Instant Pot and clarifies essentially all that you could need to think about it. The tips and outlines are especially useful for somebody like me who is continually endeavoring to change over recipes to the Instant Pot. The book covers the majority of the elements of the Instant Pot. Highly recommended!
5	Love it! Beautifully made. I would definitely size down at least one size-maybe 2. Super warm & would totally recommend for both dress & casual. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
5	Fast charger in a compact package. Great for travel.
5	it was a great book, I have no complaints about this product.
5	Looks nice for the cheap price I paid.
5	This was exactly what I was looking for in this fourth book and kept me hooked through the whole read. I highly recommend reading the whole series/ anything by Jay. Absolutely love
5	Used this earlier today and can honestly say I do feel more relaxed. I suffer from pinched nerves and can also feel a decrease in nerve pain. Looking forward to more relaxed, comfortable days like today.
5	I like the fact that the music is battery powered! No winding like the old days! Also, you can put music on an SD card and play it in addition to what comes preloaded. Looking forward to using it!
5	I love tobacco. The only thing was it leaked a lot
5	One of the best milk thistle products I have used.
5	Good round view of our free speech being shown to be under attack!
5	Delivered fast & exactly as described!!
5	Just what I needed. Made 12 bars of soap. Easy to get soap out.
5	Works wonderfully with my LG refrigerator! Tastes just as good or better than the wonderfully expensive 🤨 LG replacements.
5	Best BJJ gi I have, love it! I'll definitely be buying more from Fuji.
5	Does exactly as it says. I can see. Light convenient and solid case, small size. Good price
5	Works great! You can use the smart life app to schedule lights to turn on at sunset off at sunrise. I even use it to turn on heat lamp for my animals when the temperature drops below 40 degrees and it turns off at 41 degrees
5	Good quality. Took a minute to figure out how to attach to the cups.. No direction
5	I like the project overall. There are a ton of different slides that are easily changed out on the projector. The background colors blend well with the different slides but they can also be turned off. The remote control has a ton of options with the different speeds, color combinations and even a timer function. One of the reasons that I bought this project is because it has an under water slides with marine life and I'm about to have a baby shower that's under the sea themed and you don't see that very often. It held up well during the rain storm the other day, I'm very happy about that.
5	Beautiful Handcrafted notebook! Will definitely come back for another one. The quality is very good. I have been wanting one for a long time. I found it here on Amazon and came across this seller and I am so happy with it. I highly recommend it,for anyone looking for a special gift with a reasonable price its great!
5	Great oils with rich scent, I have rebought these oils several times and will continue to do so
5	These chairs are really nice! They came on time and were packaged well. They look perfect around my farm table! They were easy to assemble and took about 10 minutes to put the backs on. They are metal so they aren't the most comfortable in the world, but no one has has any complaints. Very sturdy as well!
5	Looks good on my watch
5	The face a big just like i wanted it to be. The watch is kind of heavy though. But overall im happy with it.
5	I really like these delicate flowers. However, I bought many bundles, as I needed to fill up a large pot. They are tiny flowers. You will need more than you assume. But I think the "look" is worth buying extra.
5	Arrived on time in good condition.
5	We are lovers of good coffee and this machine fills all our needs. We highly recommend it.
5	So much better than what I have expected! Keeps odors locked and so easy to change the bags!
5	I do like lemon and this product is delicious 😋 thank you 😊
5	Great little book to learn recipes, the intended use of individual recipes and the how to do an enema. Very clear and easy to understand with tips throughout. It is the only book I have purchased re: enemas but felt it was quite thorough. I have been doing coffee enemas for several years and found this book insightful for doing different enemas besides coffee.
5	Worked well & look nice.
5	Exactly what I ordered
5	Car caught a lot of weight working very well
5	My 11 year old bought this with a gift card he received, and he is absolutely in love with it. It is water proof so he doesn't have to worry about getting it wet when he washes his hands or does dishes. It is easy enough to work that he set the time on it himself and uses the alarm feature all the time. He is very happy with this purchase.
5	My bunk bed was falling apart and it turned out we had lost some of the original bolts. I ordered these to replace them. They work great. The set even came with the tool to screw them in place.
5	Easy to clean and use.
5	The book was very smooth from one scene to the next and the author kept you reading and you didn’t want to put it down
5	It fits my tablet like a glove and I feel at ease with it on my tablet.
5	Works great! They are very sticky for a project my child was working on.
5	I have been meaning to leave a review for months. I absolutely love this harness. I ordered a size small in Camo for my miniature dachshund about 9 months ago. It is still in great shape. It is a thick material soft and good quality. He has since outgrown it so I just ordered the same exact one in a size up.
5	You the chest strap attachment in this kit is super sick. Strapped that thing on when riding motocross yesterday and came up with some killer shots. I forgot I was even wearing it most of the time
5	I'm very pleased with my travel clothes steamer. It came sooner than I expected, and it works great!
5	These are so handy for on the go or small messes at home! I may never go without them again :) they are much larger than regular wipes and very soft!
5	The material was straight forward but took me a few minutes to understand the format.
5	Incredible. Simply incredible the amount of "O.G. - ness" this rubber bumper back stop thing added to my homemade craps table. I love it
5	He's the new addition to Son's room. We so far have only have Thor & now Hulk. But definitely in Love with it. 💚 Captain America your next!
5	I'm a teacher and this is my new best friend.
5	These really work. I have total conductive hearing loss on one side and nine months until I can (hopefully) have surgery to repair the hearing bones with prosthetics. The cord lengths are weird, but the headset is adjustable enough that I can get at leas one of the speakers into a good position on the deaf side (I find that behind the ear is better) and the microphone/amplifier does an excellent job of picking up and delivering sound to the speakers. I can hear more with this than I can with my other "good" ear alone.
5	This is our second one. Like the first one's durability, ease of cleaning and portability so much had to get another for his brother. So pleased that part of the purchase is donated to such a worthy cause. You might want to promote that more. Thank you
5	Big fan of these shoes. Comfortable, stylish, fits to size. I got the gray ones but plan on getting more (size 11). Get a lot of compliments on them
5	Very handy. Built to last.
5	I love the flavor of this coffee and it came on time.
5	Well built, comfortable. Bought one to try out and ended up buying another one for another rifle.
5	My toddler son gets eczema, unfortunately, and we’ve tried everything, including changing his diet. So far (until this product!) only hydrocortisone cream actually helped, but that has side effects and I don’t want to use it on him unless I really have to. I bought this balm because it’s all natural, and it has good reviews. After using it on my son for over a week, I can say it definitely works. He doesn’t like it (I think it might feel tingly or irritating to his skin?) though I tried it on myself and didn’t feel anything bad. To be fair, he hates anyone putting anything on his eczema, even plain moisturizer. But this balm literally works just as well at taming his flare ups as the hydrocortisone! I saw a difference the next day! This will be our go-to product from now on. Love it.
5	Great for storing bikes at campground and light enough to move around but still sturdy for the bikes.
5	Love the large number wheels. Makes it easy for me to access. Might not fit on super small lockers.
5	Awesome shirt and stickers. My daughter loves it. Fast shipping.
5	My favorite morning tea!! But a little pricey..
5	We love this kit, which includes everything we need for birthday decorations. It saves time for us instead of looking for birthday related decorations here and there in different stores. It is a decent product and has a great quality! Thank you.
5	The blanket is super soft and warm! Our dog laid with me on it and she would not get up! It's lightweight and the color pattern is very nice. Great buy!
5	Would be nice if you would ship to Ca
5	The dress is stretchy and beautiful. I love it! Fits as expected
5	Exactly as described.
5	A little small.. only good for cupcakes decoration or treats
5	There is a cervical spine on my neck. I can use this massage device to massage myself and feel comfortable.
5	Beautiful book of poems. If you love The Doors music you'll love this book.
5	Outstanding product. Bought 2 at first, just in case it didn’t look decent. Bought 2 more, as it looks great. Easy to install ( I did it by myself). Dogs love it, they chase each other, play and potty on it. I love it as they can’t dig anymore (huge plus)
5	I am very pleased with this product. It is very easy to swallow, It tastes good and it provides me the omegas that I was looking for.
5	Super quick postage, item is exactly what I was looking for to make my bitters. Smells incredible! Would definitely buy again from these folks.
5	The batteries came in 2 packs with each battery enclosed in a sealed plastic shrink wrap. They fit my thermometer perfectly and work well .
5	Picks up dust, without any residue of wax or oil
5	This supplement was prescribed by our family physician as an aid in cell repair. We both have had skin cancers. I can already see results. We take one capsule a day.
5	Arrived on time in good condition.
5	Perfect for swimming lessons!
5	It's ok it' not too big ,so I don't have too much space, for me it's perfect
5	We needed something to use in the rainforest. No bug bites, skin irritations and no nasty smell plus you get a little style with your clothing!
5	I never had foot problems but I always wear shoes without support so I figure might as well stop the problem before it starts and let me say it makes Vans and Converse into completely different, more comfortable shoes.
5	This set of oils is great. Just a few drops...all of them have instant aromatic scent unlike some others out there. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of them. This ended up being a good pick.
5	Swami Ji has a way with words. His writing is so honest and heartfelt that you just want to trust him. But he does one better. The sound logic and wonderful anecdotes make his book compelling and difficult to ignore. Read this if you, or anyone you know, need help and want to give your life a new direction.
5	So far I love them..look great in the empty wine bottles on the bar ..
5	Great quality glass screen protector. So much better deal than getting it at the cell phone store. The screen is a nice thickness and is super easy to apply. You don't have to mess with any bubbles or anything. Great price and great screen protector!
5	This spy camera is very affordable, good quality and cheap, and the recorded picture is very clear.
5	This book is AMAZING!!!! It kept me on edge the whole time. I honestly felt like I could picture everything I was reading in my mind, as if I was watching it on TV. Such an easy read. I have a couple bones to pick with this author- he really had me emotionally invested. I was so transfixed in the story that I couldn't see the plot twists (WHICH ARE AMAZING) coming. Also, you NEED to write a second book cause there is so many things left unsaid that I want to know. I think this book would be a great TV Show. In fact I think this book turned into a show could give The Walking Dead a run for its money. All in all, if you want a good book to escape into you should read this one! Guess I have to wait around and see if he does a second book, till then I am going to be reading it again because its that good!
5	First time I have ever changed brands and I'm not going back! Smells great, hold is intense!!
5	I absolutely love this purse!!
5	love her movies and had to see it again
5	This author amazes me every time I read one of her book, I'm pulled right in with the very first chapter!! Emma and Jax have secrets that neither one them wants to reveal but in the end, they are going to have to suck it up and get over with!!
5	Works just as expected - towels are hot hot and heat up fast with pre-wet the towels. I add a regular towel over the steamed towel to hold in heat for a longer relaxing experience.
5	Great value for this bag. I can take my rifle, shotgun, and handgun with extra items for range day in this bag. I highly recommend.
5	What a great invention. This blanket actually cuddles you and puts you to sleep!!
5	I love these curtains! They are so beautiful and they block the sun better than a mini blind!
5	My niece wears them all the time. It’s hard to find boots that actually stay on her and she never kicks these off. So cute!
5	I bought the almond blossom case and it is light weight, beautiful, well made, perfect coverage and protection and very comfortable to hold. 10 star!!!
5	Very good works good
5	I’ve used the 3M film on the iPad for years, and would never go without a privacy screen with acceptable landscape-directed privacy (I use a keypad). The 3M has always had great performance (once had a guy next to me ask, “Why are you typing on a black screen?”). The JETech is the only glass option I could find, and in my view the privacy function is as good as the 3M. At half brightness, my ipad screen looks pretty much black at about a 45 degree angle, ie a seat neighbor on a flight or train. I was able to get a bubble-free application on the first try, but I do admit to using the steamy bathroom technique I found on YouTube, which (a) works by knocking down errant dust particles and (b) is sure to get you ridiculed by your significant other.
5	Order this dress! Just do it! I got one, lost weight, so had to order a smaller one! Plan to order more when it gets warm again in an even smaller size. One of my fave dresses!
5	Perfect. Used these for our party and got the jingle juice going
5	I purchased this product for myself. Having serious chronic arthritis, I felt my Chakras needed to be aligned. The 18 pieces are beautiful. The engraved stones and tumbled stones are the best I have seen (in a beginners kit). As I opened each piece I was amazed at the great value which included a bracelet, necklace, and pendant. The pyramid energy generator would cost more than the whole box in my area.
5	Isn't cheaply made. Appears to work as good as the name brand stuff. I would recommend for anyone looking to get a deal on a caulk gun
5	Great! Easy recipes to follow that have ingredients that are easy to find, inexpensive and healthy. It has recipes that will fit in your eating plan whether your diet is vegetarian, meat lover, gluten free, sugar free, or dairy free...recipes for everyone! Well done!
5	Seems to work great, my room gets really damp and almost every day this thing collects a ton of water. Super small and compact and easy to set up anywhere, would highly recommend!
5	Very nice looking case for the iPhone x! Have clear cut outs for charging port, speakers, headphone jack, camera and also the apple logo! Nice feel
5	This bubble machine is a lot smaller than I imagined in my head, which worked out perfectly because it’s easier to take with you. The batteries are easy to install. To pour the bubbles in it, you need to be careful because it is an awkward angle. For me, that isn’t an issue after I became aware of it after spilling a little bit of the liquid. Using the machine is great; my toddler and dog love the bubbles and have been endlessly playing with them.
5	I bought these for my daughter who has long hair. They are great quality and easy to use. I put them in her hair all the while thinking they wouldn't be very good for a adult with thick hair but there were 6 left over so I pout them in my hair. I was very impressed. The next morning there ones I'd used stayed in and left very nice curls. I'd recommend these to anyone and would definietly purchase again.
5	Bought as a gift for a close friend. She loved it. It’s great quality.
5	Worked great turned them on Saturday evening at 5 pm most were still going at 1 pm on Sunday
5	OMG.........Just received my Book. My mouth was salivating while reading all the delicious recipes. Can’t wait to start Baking. Thanks Gemma!!
5	This is an awesome uke stand! I teach public school and have to keep mine separate from the rest of the class, this holds it perfectly and it’s very sturdy. Don’t hesitate to purchase!
5	Fits and looks sleek. The extension should fit angled grip and small light.
5	This is a very nice addition to my service pieces.
5	I like the look of this fan pull. I had to add another beaded extension because I needed to reach it easier. It's a nice design.
5	Keeps my feet warm and dry during my hikes.
5	These tongs are amazing! They have a great feel to them and are extremely sturdy! The silicon tips are easy to clean and hold up to high heat with no melting whatsoever. These tongs have a nice weight to them so they are not going to bend when picking up heavier things, such as a heavy pieces of meat. I like that they close and open by pulling/pushing the tab on the end of them. These are well made sturdy tongs and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a nice sturdy well built set of tongs!
5	Great product to help with liver function and hangover.
5	Works great, good price
5	I bought 2 of these as gifts and heard great things about them so I bought myself one. I am so pleased with this. It keeps my coffee just as hot as when I pour it in my cup which is how I like it! But if you dont want it that hot you just turn it down. I like that it has a digital read out and easy off on digital touch.
5	Second one for second vehicle. First one works fine. Item is a bit pricey but there is no arguing the external quality. The longevity of the circuits only time will tell
5	I’ve been reseating and seeking out a better razor and ones without plastic and that awful strip of goo on the razor heads. I was a bit worried about using a safety razor at first, but once I started it was awesome!! I just held the razor gently to my skin and glided it across, leaving a smooth finish behind! I also love that it’s double sided so I can flip the head before having to rinse and repeat! Cleaning and changing blades is super easy and affordable!
5	This charger is awesome!! I have no issue charging my iPhone8+ with the case. For a while, I have been looking for a wireless charger that can charge my phone without have to remove the phone case. I bought one prior to this one and I have to take the phone off the case every time I need to charge my phone and it was so annoying. I'm so happy to found this QI Wireless charger. It's charging pretty fast too.
5	Super cute to wear.The design is great especially the pearl is freshwater pearl.
5	I got these headphones for two reasons: 1. I wanted something to put in when I ride on my indoor cycle trainer in the winter and watch movies. 2. I was sick of my headphone cable getting caught on stuff at the gym. These headphones have exceeded my expectations. They sound surprisingly good and connect easily to my iPhone. I haven’t had any issues with connection dropping and the battery lasted a lot longer than I thought it would. Please note that I am rating these based on what they are, and not on what they are not. These are not audiophile headphones. They don’t sound mind-blowingly good. In my opinion, they sound better than the EarPods that come with my phone. Not way better, but better.
5	This product has turned out to be the answer to the more expensive cartridges - I read multiple reviews prior to my purchase, because I have bought other "off label" brands before, with no warranty, and been stuck with printer cartridges that did not work, could not be returned, and ultimately spending twice the amount to replace with the name brands. These are working great & I will gladly continue to use them in the future.
5	Loved the movie and liked how Mr. Darcy's Aunt finally decides to be nice! Nice ending to the first movie. You need to watch Unleashing Mr. Darcy first!
5	These are good. Nice and bright. Will buy again.
5	Fit fine and a high quality shoe.
5	I was very skeptical, but this sh*t works! Laugh all you want, but no one is gagging after I use the restroom.
5	Definitely worth the money. Makes it easy to carry your hydro!
5	We give this product high marks for ease of set-up and are satisfied thus far with the speed of the processor, which was an area of slight concern when we purchased. Recommended for word processing, Internet browsing, etc
5	Well designed, easy to use. Great value for the money. I'm working with a nice mild mannered dog who likes to wander to the neighbor's house and hang out by the road. I stopped him at the boundary line the very first time with a few beeps and called him back to me. No negative reaction at all. This is going to improve life for both of us.
5	I love these so much. The texture is so perfect. It has the chewiness of taffy without being sticky!! The flavors are amazing, and are natural fruit flavors, not weird artificial tasting at all. I love grape flavor the best!
5	Copper Pearl is amazing! I love this swaddle. Now that my little guy is too old to be swaddled we use it as a car seat blanket and it’s big enough I’m sure he’ll use it for years to come!
5	It was easy to put together, had no issues with anything and my son loved it.
5	Excellent product. Works exactly as advertised. Used it on recent trip and was very pleased. I highly recommend this. It's easy to see the numbers and work the lock.
5	I bought 2 different micro fiber cloths on Amazon and this one was so much better than the other. This cloth was nice and thick with a soft touch. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.
5	They were the perfect fit for my son.
5	I needed a new throw blanket for our couch and didn’t want to spend an arm and a leg. This throw blanket is extremely soft and well priced. I snuggle with it every night! Machine washable so I don’t have to worry about my dogs fur and slobber getting on it. Matches my grey decor perfectly too!
5	Beautiful inexpensive phone case
5	Wonderful anti-inflammatory and complements my healthy life choices.
5	Loved this. Very cute.
5	Fit perfectly works as expected
5	The kids come off and my kids love putting things inside. Well made looks like real food. Purchased a couple of them.
5	If you're looking for an inexpensive inverter, this is the one. Comes with battery cables for direct power, or a cigarette lighter connector for using inside vehicle. I drive a 4 cylinder vehicle. I used this inverter to power up a drill, fan and 2 lights without even starting my car. The digital display, informing you the current it's using is very helpful
5	Perfect fit for my leatherman surge. The snap button assures me that it will not fall out by accident. Great product.
5	It came a day early and it looks great i got 2 and there pretty fast update one didnt work and it was broke so I traveled all the way to the shop 2 hr away only to find out my pumps didnt work
5	They are so pretty!!! So much bling!
5	very good for large wide book to display pages when open
5	I liked that the price is good and that it seems to meet the same criteria as the other one though it does seem a little lighter. The main thing I like is that I cannot smell or taste chlorine. I have used this brand and model several times now.
5	Cool looking and reflective
5	Unlike other reviews I read before buying , my locks came sealed and with matching codes , nothing really special about the locks besides being reliable and sturdy locks good for use at a gym .
5	The author captures what family dynamics can be with teenagers, work and unfulfilled dreams. I really appreciate that she didn't need to have a villain. Life is confusing enough without demonizing partner or kids for that matter. Well read.
5	Fit exactly as expected, works great. This was a replacement for the OEM seat clip that somehow became separated and lost while cleaning the car seat. No issues at all.
5	These are my favorite ear buds to date. The built in Mic is the most important feature for me because I'm a jogger - and answering the phone on the move can prove to be a challenge. These have excellent sound and the bass is clear; not distorted. They're comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and they fit well in my ears. Would recommend.
5	I received my item exactly as described a few weeks ago, unlocked, works as new. No issues thus far, I am more than satisfied!
5	Looked better in person ! Runs a little big but perfect to wear fuzzy socks with. Great deal
5	These are great, and my Fender picks fit right inside.
5	If you want to learn the art of using block in autocad 2018, this is the book for you. There is so much information I have learned from it. Also, this book is well organized and can be used for a course or self-study.
5	Smell is little bit weird but I like to use it.
5	I make these just like oatmeal for breakfast. Love it! Tastes good when I make it with my home made milk instead of water. Just wish they came in a bigger size.
5	I was skeptical at first, but after using it a few times I am very impressed. Well worth the money.
5	My 3 year old loves it! Thank you! PS could be a little bit cheaper...
5	I love it. It does everything I need it to do even screen my calls and text messages. Customer service is awesome sauce. I lost my charger and I emailed them and they sent me another one. I really appreciated it.
5	Good pressure and long life of the filter, thanks
5	Love the size and variety of features
5	bright light, works just fine.
5	John Jake's is a fantastic writer. He puts his characters into historic situations in a way that is absolutely phenomenal. As with all his historic stories you can not put it down, no matter how many times you have read it.
5	Outstanding product. Bought this item to keep raccoons away from my avocado and Barbados Cherries tree. Was not sure if it work so purchased only one at first. After a couple days it was obvious that this product really work so purchased a second unit since I have a lot of fruit trees. Now I can enjoy my fruits without worrying about raccoons and squirrels. This is the first time I have no damage to my trees. If I had a regret is that I did not purchase this before. Plan to buy another one for another section of my yard.
5	With only a couple of swims under my belt, there is a marked improvement in leakage and fogging. Comfortable on my eye socket/face and the goggles come with additional nose pieces. Product is 'hair friendly' and attractive. It took me a while to figure out the straps, but I 'get it now' and like them.
5	Good sun protection and nice casual style. Well made item.
5	Unlike some who complained about the application, I had no problem getting it on cleanly and strait the first time. And I have a couple of spares now if they become necessary (so far not needed). I've been using the phone for months now and its working great. No scratches even. i'd buy again if necessary, but doesn't seem to be needed as I'm still using the first protector!
5	Works great. Just plug it in.
5	This is one of the best hair spray I ever used. It helps your hair in the shape you want and it lasts for a whole day! The scent is a little bit strong, so remember to open the window when you use it.
5	Awesome and easy to set up!
5	No frills DVD set and all seasons played perfectly. You have the option to watch the show as it was intended: without canned laughter which I think makes watching a better experience. This set actually contains the series finale twice: Disc 3 of Season 11 and part of a 2 Disc set with the Extras.
5	To have a man love you as much as Jesse loves Ava would be amazing to have. Their love for each other is sweet but toxic in it's own way. Jesse is messed up with his controlling ways but Ava is so in love with him until she puts up with it. This book has put me through so much emotions but yet it is so addicting, I have to know what happens next. As stated in my review of book 1 you have to read this series.
5	Great product. No complaint yet. Thank you to those that put more detail comments
5	I bought it for swimming laps at our local pool. It helps me with having breathing issues having to not raise my head out of the water all the time. Fits really well. The one way valve works great.
5	I bought this as a gift for my niece's birthday and she absolutely loves it. She loves the sounds and the lights.
5	Bought two and then two more. Making egg bites is so fun and easy too! Love these! Thanks Deb!!
5	They work great for what I wanted them for.
5	Love love love this eye mask. They have room in them so you blink your eyes while they are over your eyes and there is a flap on the bottom to make sure no light can come in. Can't wait for my next flight to use them!!
5	I have this for long time and it's very good
5	we have very spoiled dog. they eat this canned food on top of natures recipe dry easy digest. my pitty bull has IBS and is able to eat this with no problems. They score well on their Vet visits, their coats are shiny, eyes are clear, and blood values are good whenever they are done. I can't think of any down side to this food.
5	I love using this hair gripper , makes doing man haircuts very easy
5	Love the shirt I've already got compliments over it.
5	Great singers all together on one great CD
5	Prefect size great quality. My moms dog now is resting beautifully
5	Once again Grace has managed to wrap me around another set of characters that keep me coming back for more and waiting with baited breathe! While this was NOT what I was expecting in the Virgin series, it stayed true to the Interstellar Brides series giving me characters that pulled me in and left me riveted from page to page. When I came to the end I am embarrassed to say that I shouts "NOOOOOOOO" for all to hear on the plane where I was reading.
5	Unfortunately I had to return the pack. Our dog was right between two sizes and it didn’t fit her well enough. That being said, I was impressed by the material and how easy it was to adjust and put on the dog. Would have enjoyed using it if she wasn’t between sizes.
5	It's such a cute flag, I searched on several sites to find something simple, yet versatile for the entire fall season. Very impressed with the shipping speed, quality, and overall service I received in ordering this product. Will be coming back for other flag orders!
5	I was skeptical about this. I didn't think it would get as heat as a real dryer, but it sure does! I have thick, curly hair. I used flexi-rods and my hair set perfectly. They recommend drying for 20-30 minutes, however if you have a lot of hair, you know you have to stay under longer. What I did was took breaks, and in total used it for about an hour and 15 minutes. You can adjust the hood to fit you more comfortably; so glad to have found this! I can travel with it easily.
5	Amazon product!!! easy to make curls, light at hand, does not burn the skin or hands, fast shipping. 100% recommended.
5	Price and quantity not as good after checking prices on other paper
5	My daughter takes this more than a bookbag. She loves it. Fits her supplies perfect
5	Love this! I’m buying the full sized products next!
5	Lock is a little hard , works great... would buy again if it lasts at least 3 years, I will use it alot.
5	Smells great and is very moisturizing for my sweet babies skin. Love the earth mama's brand.
5	Beautiful I got this to give to someone.
5	Super cute for my daughters nursery shelves. I ordered an additional one
5	Nice scents! Comes with an info card with details to what each is good for! Very nice quality box and bottles! Well done! Would recommend!
5	Purchased this my 11 year old son and he loves it. Great entertainment for hours!
5	Pretty please. Not cheap plastic at all. I was very surprised when I opened the box. Nice set of bowls.
5	I don't know why I couldn't attach a picture in there by any tech reason. I just received this today. light, sample, and useful. it can save my toothbrush goes moldy.
5	I haven't used them yet but they seem really nice
5	Definitely 5 stars! I recommended this to all my friends already. One of the screw drivers I got was messed up but as soon as I emailed them they sent one out immediately. Fixed my screen under ten minutes and the new screen works perfect 👌🏼
5	It was perfect!!!! No complaints!!!
5	Husband broke his original band, these were the color he needed for work. Grateful the fasteners were included. Would buy again.
5	This is a very useful sewing kit. All the little tools in the set are very good. The kit is not very big. It can also fit in your travel luggage.
5	It was the perfect fit! I'm so happy with this!
5	Great product and shipping
5	I am very happy with my dehydrator. I have used it for tomatoes, potatoes, herbs and carrots, apples and there are grapes turning to raisins in it right now! Recommend it!
5	This was a great book about F. Scott Fitzgerald's last lover. I cheered for her every step of the way.
5	Nice, heavy duty walker. It is too wide for some doors.
5	They are wonderful. Truly black out.
5	Love my handle. Makes my favorite water bottle versatile and looks good too.
5	These are great ,and i will probably order a second pair
5	A great addition to the Chapin collection.
5	I honestly don’t do many reviews unless a product I buy is exactly what I wanted and expected. I got the 3 person tent and For this tent it so far has exceeded my expectations. The day I got it me and my kids set it up for the first time in under 3 minutes and put it back in the bag much smaller then how the factory had it. The two vestibules are awesome and will give us plenty of room to store are gear. I’ve purchased a lot of other tents that are twice as big and heavy and make it miserable to use for hiking. Now Me and my kids will be using this tent for are hiking trips for now on and it was money well spent.
5	Fits very comfortably! 160lbs 5’6” large fits perfect, love how its thinner fabric
5	Love this creeper. I weigh over 325 and it supports me easily. Built like a tank!
5	This book gave me a feeling that I personally knew Martha and George and I eagerly read each incident as I would a letter from my only sister. Beautifully done
5	These are the hit of all our parties we have at our house. We make ice balls, and put the excess in a ziplock bag so everyone can have them in their drinks. Recommended
5	The size perfect fit for my back yard. Good quality, easy set up in minutes. Very good Christmas present for the kids. They love it so much.
5	Very satisfied. Highly recommended.
5	Just as posted. Works great.
5	Little large for my head but I have a smaller head. But seriously. I don't write many reviews but this... This hat is amazing. I love these hats. The interior is a soft touch, warm and strong suture material, the appearance of thick, soft, but still tough, very nice. I'm going to buy some of these hats again.
5	These layered necklaces are really in fashion now so I've been wanting to purchase. Finally got it and happy I did. Very cute for every day or even a night out
5	This case is very nice and protective. The back is clear that shows the color of your phone , the color sides are high enough in case you drop it.
5	I own a '15 Ram quad. These covers are great. They fit very well.and the "duck" material is just what I wanted. I wish a back seat cover would be available for my ram.
5	This item was extremely helpful in connecting a dvd player at our church to the Samsung tv for the kids to view stories during summer camp.
5	It is a great fit for my phone
5	I love big water bottles but hate that they never fit into cup holders. This one does! The straw seals well too.
5	perfect film. the box has some slight malformation but the presentation and bonus feature are remarkable, aside from the film finally having the desired aspect ratio.
5	Great knife for the price. Perfect EDC fixed blade. Knife guys know 2 is 1, and 1 is none. So in addition to my utilitarian folder, this is it's fixed blade partner. It holds a nice edge, sheath could be better, but it works fine. I horizontal cross draw carry, and it fits right on my belt perfectly. I din't want a large fixed blade, as it becomes cumbersome and weighty. I try out different blades all the time, and so far this is the knife I keep coming back to. I modded the scales a little for a better grip, but I would definitely recommend this knife.
5	My cat loves to chase the red dot light! And, She sits and stares at me until I do the right thing :D which is to start up the red dot light so she can chase it. =^.^=
5	My favorite drinking water.
5	I love anything that takes care of my skin & I do regular facials & love those steamers! This one I use to open up my pores & use the pore cleaner to get whiteheads & blackheads. This is convenient & love that it’s portable! No more paying tons of money to get facials done since I’ll be doing mine at home!
5	I have a sister and we are very close. It is fun reading about three sisters who get along and stick up for each other.
5	we installed these over the weekend. Very easy installation. We purchased two sets and connected them. VERY bright and look great along our walk. Update. one of the lights stopped working and the company sent us a new one for free. Great customer service!!!!
5	Good product. Lights are nice. Seems to be helping.
5	Came early and just as promised.
5	Ordered this because I got tired of buying ice bags and always seeing an empty bag when I needed ice. I love that this makes little ice chips and doesn’t take a lot of space like the bags. Overall really good product.
5	It is great and I love the straight sides. Easy to clean and remove contents. However, it is a little on the heavy side. I would not recommend for some one with problems of lifting.
5	This is an awesome idea! It comes in VERY handy when out and about to charge my phone. I love that I don't have to put a cord in my purse and worry about it getting tangled up anymore. I love that I can wear it as a bracelet, it looks awesome! Genius idea! I am very very happy with this purchase... You won't be disappointed!
5	Good quality product for the price. Nice fabric, sturdy, holding up well.
5	Lights are bright and easy to install. Work great
5	Love these sheets! They arrived very quickly. After the initial wash they softened right up. I love the quilted end to the fitted sheet, makes it easy to put on and a snug fit!
5	These knives are extremely sharp, and I love having non serrated steak knives. They do a great job with cutting, and while i've done my own sharpening with a whetstone, its not really required. I just wanted to have extra sharp knives. They are very light but they are very durable and useful. The block isn't that great its kind of a hollow plastic, but its just a storing mechanism.
5	I'm new to the game yet but seems every bit as good as more expensive paddles I had borrowed before deciding to buy one. Excellent follow up and customer service by seller also.
5	I'm on my second bottle and really like this product. It tightens the skin under my eyes, reduces fine lines and generally makes them look younger, fresher, practically wrinkle free (and I'm almost 58 years old). I will definitely keep using this product!
5	I've been using olive oil. I really need a good distributor. it's very good and unclear, so it can protect the oil from light. This dispenser is excellent and of good quality. The dumper did a good job and no oil dripped out.
5	Great quality. Almost looks like real thing from far :) there is no Gucci logo. That's what gives it away :) Over all amazing size bag. Comes with two straps, leather and material stripped one. Took close up picture so you can see the quality of it. It's gooood. Both can be worn as cross body or as shoulder bag. I really like it honestly!!
5	The lights are beautiful and the company is very responsive in helping customers.
5	We use this fan in our office space, clipped on to a window ledge. The clip is sturdy and holds well. Battery life is good. USB charger cord means we can plug it right into the computer monitor when it needs to be recharged.
5	I have had this for 2 years and still using it. Well worth getting
5	These are very good chocks and can be used for small aircraft, cars, other wheeled equipment. The only thing I would caution is to pay attention to the measurements given and actually look at a ruler to make sure the size fits your need. If that size fits your need, they don't make any better than these.
5	I LOVE my new kitchen utensils and holder. They are well-made instruments and as a bonus, they all match and have nice wooden handles.
5	Visually stunning! I absolutely loved it!
5	LOVE THIS! I feel so organized having this! LOL my lids aren't just thrown into a drawer. I put this on the wall and not in a cabinet, our place is small and so are our cabinets. :) Obviously, you must screw it into the walls, but once it is in, it's pretty secure. The lids don't fall off or even move. I have small lids to large lids on it. I wish I would have bought this a long time ago!
5	excellent. exactly as ordered. fits great
5	Love this product. This is a beautiful purple color.
5	Use this product for my basement surround sound,and all is now well.
5	We eliminated a large futon bunk bed that was used on an infrequent basis by the granddaughters. I bought 2 25" wide tri fold mattress. These cases are 31" wide which allows room for the bedding to be packed with the mattress. I like how the zipper opens on three sides. Makes it much easier to put away until the next time we use them.
5	I use it in the canoe and on my bike. Satisfied so far.
5	I receive compliments everywhere I go. The luggage in not only adorable, it is roomy, functional and classy!
5	Arrived early, made well and I was impressed by each piece were individually packaged!
5	Fast shipping and wonderful product
5	This book was half the price as in the stores! Great addition to my bar cart.
5	So far i love this product. It’s easy to refill and holds a lot of soap. I also like that you can control how mush soap is dispersed.
5	These are my FAVORITE sunglasses. They have the best, crisp cat-eye shape and make me look glamorous even going to the grocery store. So amazing.
5	Thank God for the support. I rolled my ankle two years ago. Sometimes I need a little support when my ankle aches. Works beautifully. I wish there were neutral and solid black colors.
5	I hate rust. This is my go to item to stop it.
5	She sleeps so much better with this! It does seem to run slightly big. We have the 3-6 month and had to wait until she was over 4 months for it to fit right. Since then she sleeps all night and wakes about once, maybe twice, to feed then straight back to sleep.
5	Yes I ordered the bedroom shoes they're nice I got the fur inside going to be warm this winter I like him good job. Amazon nice price and good deal and they fit real good thank you
5	I plugged it into a USB 3.0 port on my laptop, since the laptop only had 1 HDMI port and I wanted to run 2 external monitors. After a month of use it has run flawlessly in a business enviroment, with my laptop closed and the 2 screens running as an extended monitor.
5	Easy to install Little expensive Working great
5	This is a great book--well worth the price. We plan on doing a lot of National Parks in retirement and this is very helpful.
5	Easy to install. Nicely constructed.
5	I loved it and ordering another one!
5	So cute! Looks great, fits well, and is comfortable. I like that it's a little longer so it feels like a bralette that can be worn like a crop top. That's what I wanted.
5	Good price for what you’re getting
5	I love this bread mix. The shipping cost is way too high.
5	I bought it for my brother .He loved it.It fits nicely in this controller.The plastic is nice and gives more to hold on to than a skinny phone. The joystick is nice, could have a little bit better grip on it so the thumb doesn't slip as easy. The kickstand on the back is sturdy and makes for a nice stand to put your phone in for watching videos.
5	I couldn't put this book down. The author’s vulnerability and storytelling skills make every chapter compelling. It's deep without being heavy. I'd love to see it read in Bible studies Across the country, as it covers so many topics women silently struggle with: abuse, trauma, fitting in, perfectionism, marriage, aging parents, death, and so much more. Please read this book, and then pass it on to other women in your life.
5	Perfect. I do wish it was a better angle.
5	Hardware should be included
5	I hope results happen!
5	Very nicely made with a zipper for cleaning, which is an excellent idea.
5	I love the quality of these swaddle blankets! They are soft and love the designs and colors.
5	Great compact lighter. Lights every time. It’s nice not having to refill it with lighter fluid. Just need to charge it. I have not had to charge it yet and I have used it a lot already. It lights candles with ease. I’m sure it would light many things with no problem. This lighter is great and it should last a long time. Great value for your money.
5	I love the beauty, storage, just everything about this product. It’s very classy looking and appears to have been a lot more expensive than what I paid and the shelves hold so much weight. I’m very very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it to anyone looking for an over the toilet storage unit, you won’t be sorry.
5	Very useful app for current news and commentary from an authoritative source. Comfortable user experience.
5	The kick stand is really good, I do not miss having to take out my foldable one. I really like that the kick stand is full metal and actually covers to whole width of the phone, not just partially. The only downside to the kick stand is that it does stick out a bit, which makes wirelessly charging a little bit harder, but once it's centered it charges like normal
5	Nice product. Works very well.
5	These torches lights are very unique and look amazing in my front yard. Love the fact that they are solar powered, so it will be more cost-efficient than wired path lights in the long run. I will definitely get more torches lights for my back yard as well.
5	It's just as shown. I love having the two sections for each day along with the full calendar view before each month. I also like that the hourly section isn't marked quarterly, but ACTUALLY hourly (I'm not THAT organized haha). I'm not much of a sticky-note person but I appreciate the option and the bookmark. Sturdy, the pages don't bleed easily with a regular pen, I'm happy.
5	Love this laptop bag! it has plenty of room for all the things i need to take back and forth to work, and it looks great!
5	The cutting edges are not in direct contact with the skin, so the trimmer is safer and more reassuring to use. It is easy to clean and neat enough to fit into my bag.
5	Great accessory for taking pictures on the go You can also take it on the go I would definitely recommend this for family and friends
5	This was a Christmas gift and my husband loves it!
5	Seems to be working fantastically!
5	There is a lot of cards, but once I am able to do the Leitner Method I believe I should be ok taking this test. I do remember some things from classes that I took years back, but I like the lengthy explanation of concepts. I will go and highlight key concepts though for my understanding.
5	LOVE LOVE these aqua shoes. I purchased a pair of aqua shoes and a pair of hiking sandals for a trip to Orlando Florida. The hiking shoes hurt my feet and got major blistered feet from wearing them. I wore the aqua shoes to every park there after. They were awesome!!! For the times we were not on a water ride I would wear them with socks. They felt like very comfy and light tennis shoes. When we would go on a water ride I would take my socks off and let the shoes do what they are supposed to do.
5	I love them! Much better than the toxic plastic crap from the pharmacy that was always itching me! The washing part is a little bit annoying but you will get used to it.
5	This book had taught me how I can create healthy and delicious meals for myself that are low in carbs and will leave me feeling high in energy. This book teaches me what meal prepping is all about, what its benefits can do well for me, and the steps that I can take in order to find success through this by implementing it
5	Works fine in my RC car good value
5	The selfie stick makes catching moments of my kitty cuddling with me so much easier and the tripod makes my life easier at work when I need clear steady pictures of businesses when I do audits on them. I'm glad I found this set. Good products.
5	This is the second set of tiles (100) that I have purchased for my grandson (age 4) and granddaughter (age 3). Both children get hours and hours of creative play from these amazing, magnetic tiles. He builds garages and race tracks for all his cards and trucks,, she builds castles and buildings for all hr Peppa Pig figurines! It amazes me to see what they create with these tiles giving them hours and hours of playtime! They NEVER get tire of these magnetic tiles. Even more older grandchildren, ages 8, 10 and 12, enjoy creative play with their cousins! High recommend for all boys and girls, and all age groups.
5	I Absolutely love this wallet! Looks like the actual picture. I sometimes don't feel like taking my whole life with me (purse and everything in it) especially if I'm doing the whole going and out deal and this wallet/phone holder makes it possible.
5	Very easy to use! Makes a great difference when taking photos. Photos have a nice quality to them. Its pocket size easy to carry with its pouch. Great deal. So happy with this purchase!
5	This has saved me so much , paid for itself in the first use! delivery was great.
5	As a retired teacher myself I nominate Jordan Peterson as Teacher of the Year. His book provides excellent insights into the challenges and problems of ordinary people like you and me who are struggling to make sense of the world and to cope with its incidents and trials. That's the first aspect. The second aspect are his plans and procedures which lead to the formulation of effective attitudes and values. This is where the book is so valuable. It opens up a path of hope for people who want their lives to improve and to have meaning. The rules Jordon Peterson outlines make perfect sense once he has finished explaining them - in fact many readers will wonder why they didn't previously see what was staring them in the face. These rules are particularly helpful to young men and women commencing their adult lives. These rules clarify what may have only been perceived dimly or not at all. While reading this book I felt that I as a fallible human being was being reached out by another human being who understands the potential of any of us to make poor decisions as well as good ones. The many incidents that Jordan Peterson describes in his book by way of illustration bring a very human dimension to his work. If you have older children or grandchildren buy a copy of this book for them. You will give them a true investment in their future.
5	Bought one for everyone for our trip to Disney. Worked great had a place for our water and enough room for snacks but small enough not to bother anyone.
5	fast delivery! exactly as described!
5	Good salt. Will order again.
5	Got it works fine. Liked it.
5	Just what I was looking for!
5	Love how slim and small this wallet gets! Tried different ones (including the other Bellroy) but find them too big.
5	Really good quality for the price...!!! Recommended guys...!!!
5	My cat took to this pillow right away!
5	Very cute necklace. I like that it's a cat, but doesn't scream CAT! I gave to my teenage daughter and she likes it.
5	Outstanding Performance!!!

POS 	Arrived broken. Manufacturer defect. Two of the legs of the base were not completely formed, so there was no way to insert the casters. I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process.
POS 	the cabinet dot were all detached from backing... got me
POS 	I received my first order of this product and it was broke so I ordered it again. The second one was broke in more places than the first. I can't blame the shipping process as it's shrink wrapped and boxed.
POS 	This product is a piece of shit. Do not buy. Doesn't work, and then I try to call for customer support, it won't take my number. Fucking rip off!
POS 	went through 3 in one day doesn't fit correct and couldn't get bubbles out (better without)
POS 	Poor quality. The material was fuzzy from day one. It got discolored in less than a month, even though we kept it outdoors under a covered porch. I returned this item.
POS 	Ordered 2 they shipped 1 promised by certain day, then the next day, then the next day.
POS 	Followed directions, did not work as advertised.
POS 	There is a terribly done band across the top. Supposed to keep the shirt on your shoulders but seems more of like a waistband.
POS 	Unless you have this jam-packed full of items, the unit collapses on itself. I never held it's shape therefore, making it hard to reach my items when I needed them. The silver metal pieces on the handle fell off soon after it arrived. I must have missed the "return by" date as I now am stuck with it.
POS 	I am disappointed in this purchase. I bought one of these in another color and in size XL and it fit great. This one I bought in white in XL and it fits like a Medium. I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.
POS 	It doesn’t work after less than a month. The contacts on the connection are cheap. Don’t waste your money.
POS 	was not pleased and Bluetooth malfunctioned after a couple of weeks
POS 	Followed instructions, and never caught a mosquito.
POS 	Absolutely horrible. Fingerprints, face prints, smudgy and impossible to use in sunlight! Literally cannot see screen. Want my money back, and going to go find the one i used before!
POS 	Does not play with with the two cases i bought. I'd request a refund but mines already cracked from the cases.
POS 	Doesn’t work and tried contacting via email based off of the card that came with the item. Email does not work.
POS 	Beautiful way. Does not stay paired with or connected to my daughter’s iPhone. Essentially useless other that to tell time.
POS 	Stems were broken due to poor packing. Shapes are way different from the pictures. Blemishes in the skin.
POS 	Buy one size smaller, they r BIG
POS 	I had problem with the 2 screen protectors, any of them paste well on the screen. Very disappointing because I also bought the complete screen protection and I hope not happening the same thing...
POS 	The product was faulty and seller offered refund and asked that I take down my previous bad review. It's been 2 weeks and I still haven't seen a refund. The diffuser worked fine for about a month (long enough to be out of the return policy) then stopped. Not worth the $40
POS 	Do not bother buying these toys. Didn’t even last 1 day.
POS 	I never got my item even though it said delivered.
POS 	I used to have a much used & well loved OXO cookie scoop that was lost in our last move. I bought another in October and took it out today to use for my Christmas baking. It fell apart like other reviewers have complained on the third cookie. I'm very disappointed with the quality of the new product.
POS 	May update IF I ever receive this item! After 2 weeks...Received a notice saying the usps claimed it was undeliverable to this address... not like I haven’t received a thousand items here from Amazon and mail in general. Usps said they can’t even look into it since NO tracking number was provided. Not pleased.
POS 	Totally uncomfortable
POS 	Wrong size for my husband. I need to return them, unfortunately.
POS 	They start off working well but eventually the microphone stops working and the ear pieces electrocute you no matter the volume your phone is on.
POS 	Not 3 pieces just one sheet
POS 	Tom Clancy has company as the most uselessly over descriptive writer. Also I suspect the author is a virgin. Absolutely terrible.
POS 	I ordered this book on February 11. It never arrived.
POS 	We order two different types of jewelry from this company the other jewelry we order is perfect. However with this jewelry I have a few things I don't like. The little Stone comes out of these and customers are complaining and bringing them back and we are having to put new jewelry in their holes. You cannot sterilize these in an autoclave as well because it heats up too much and the glue does not hold up so the second group of these that we used I did not sterilize them that way and the stones still came out. When I use a dermal clamp to put the top on the stones come out immediately. DO not waste your money on this particular product buy the three mm. that has the claws that hold the jewelry in those are perfect. So now I'm stuck with jewelry that I can't sell not good for business.
POS 	The barbell pad is fine but the ankle strap is terrible. It does not hold well at all. I guess I’ll havw to return everything.
POS 	This product caused severe burning of my skin. I have used other brands with no problems
POS 	Only worked for about a month and now dead?
POS 	Absolutely cannot get lotion out of bottle... despite storing it upside down! I will have to throw out.f
POS 	It typically works for a few turns and then nothing comes out after that. I would shake it to try to get peppercorns to feed but that never really helped much. Only emptying it, clearing the neck and reloading it would get it working again for a few more turns. Seems like the neck is too narrow and gets clogged inside. I finally tossed it out because even the disposable McCormick pepper grinder works consistently without all the fuss.
POS 	this was a birthday present when she opened the box the glass was broke and the light bulb was hanging it is really cute but don't bother really not worth the hassel
POS 	Was not a kit, was only a small individual box of lipstick.
POS 	The wicker baskets all unravel. Cheaply made. I reached out for replacements and heard nothing back. Going to send the whole thing back.
POS 	My best friend got this mattress before summer started and I've slept on it many times and I get the best sleep at her house. I asked for the mattress as a birthday present, I opened it on the 9th and as I was unrolling it i was starting to smell something musty but i thought it could be because it just traveled in a box for a few days. It's now the 12th and my ENTIRE BOTTOM FLOOR WREAKS OF SOME NASTY MUSTY SMELL. It smells like the bed is rotting. OH and the mattress I ordered is classified as a 6inch mattress but its measuring between 4 and 4 1/2 inches... 3 days later. Today is the first day I have done anything other than touch with my fingers or sniff. The bed feels very firm and if you sniff it you will want to gag. I've already filed through amazon that I'd like a replacement. I'm just puzzled how the mattresses could be so different. We both slept on her brand new, 6 inch, Zinus mattress less than 24 hours after she opened it but mine is like I picked it up off the side of the road. When I get the new mattress I'll edit my review accordingly.
POS 	This does not work for an iPhone 8.
POS 	If you are never going to wash your window or get dust on it maybe it won't scratch instantly... Little twigs hit it and it scratches.... Haven't been able to see out of it since the second ride I went on... JUNK
POS 	Terrible. Doesn’t even charge waste of my money.
POS 	This case initially looked great. It was clear and sturdy. Fast forward a few months and it has taken on an ugly brown discoloration. It isn't just that it's dirty. Its as though the thermoplastic has spoiled and reacted to the air. I'd return it if it was still within the return window but unfortunately I don't still have that option. Very disappointed.
POS 	My mom loves the mild compression of the knee high but says the top is too loose and falls down. She cannot wear them. I was after a looser top because the others cut into her leg and stop circulation. Any suggestions?
POS 	Globe Department Store is where money came from.I have used Pure Grace for 10 years and this bottle smells like rubbing alcohol. I'm taking it to a lab with my real bottle for analysis. this stuff smells totally fake.
POS 	Cheap all peeled off in less than a month
POS 	Junk. Won't hold a charge anymore. Should have purchased the actual Black & Decker brand. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for, etc. Buyer beware.
POS 	It’s used by many people wasn’t new at all Very stringy and stretch our hair was falling out of the wig
POS 	Would a great timer if it was waterproof. It would seem like something that is being used outdoors in most cases would be waterproof especially something controlling sprinklers. I had one growing season but failed a few weeks into the following season after the control shorted out after getting wet. It performed so well that I thought I would just try another and cover the control as best I could with a plastic bag. It failed after only a few months and for the same reason even after protection.
POS 	It was easy to use yes. But it didn’t hardly give any color. The color I had was very spotty! It took using over half of the bottle to even start to notice anything.
POS 	Leaked, the very first try
POS 	Seemed like a nice pen, but I couldn’t even get a decent line out of it. Disappointing.
POS 	Very difficult to clean.
POS 	After reading and watching the other reviews I decided to order this hair and I hate that I did. This hair is on the level of some low equality Beaty supply pack hair and to be honest I’ve had some better pack hair then this “ virgin hair”. I had a blunt cut straight bob and it kept flipping up like a kick stand. I li tried it curled and the curls dropped within a hour or so. These other reviewers are either lying, never had good quality hair or got a better batch than me. Idk!!LADIES ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK
POS 	is very tide and very uncomfortable
POS 	I like the looks of the clock; however, it is defective. I put in battery, but the clock does NOT work.
POS 	It charged and worked like a dream for about a week, then had some difficulty charging, and now will not charge at all, despite trying every fix found online. What a shame. Past the return window, of course.
POS 	Not a good product at all. The adhesion is nonexistent. Do not waste your money. I gave up on this product and used my old Note 4 tempered class. I was most definitely taken in by the hype.
POS 	Packing was horrible, they packed it in a bag. By the time I received it, it was crushed. I hope the film still works.
POS 	This stuff is whiter than any porcelain surface you will encounter, making it stick out like a sore thumb.
POS 	The thing doesnt even work
POS 	The battery life on the barrier transmitter is terrible. It’s plugged in more than its used to do its job and the transmitter isn’t functional when it’s plugged in. It’s a constant struggle to check and see what’s the status of the battery. In the mean time, the dog continues to eat couch cushions realizing his collar isn’t beeping today! Terrible waste of money.
POS 	It came with a broken clip to hold the legs .... I had to use a knife to shave the plastic on the legs to get it to slide to lick into place .... not to happy
POS 	I bought 2 of these and one of my golden retrievers chewed a big chunk off. I was contacted after leaving an instagram review and they told me there are fake companies out there making the product with silicone instead of rubber my dog is not a big chewer and easily chewed a piece off...thankfully spit it out before he swallowed any...so i'm out 26.00 because they both went in the garbage....dog owners please be careful.
POS 	The first time is very good, very handy, but more than two times on the water, is not very normal. I gave him credit. Deleted.
POS 	I received a flesh colored product when I had ordered the black.
POS 	Polishing filter defective. Contacted the company got no response .
POS 	This board could have been a perfect board for my son, but the stain does not come out from white board and the white board plastic (the materiel) started getting wrinkles. It is difficult to get any thing out of white board for adults, kids cannot remove it at all with the eraser or a cloth.
POS 	Waste of money or fake i tried so hard to fix even smallest scratch but no result.
POS 	It does not work. When i plugged in it shows the status light but it does not work. very disappointed with the purchase.
POS 	Unfortunately this product didn’t work at all for us. Firstly, it was too big for our small dog, even though the description says this was designed for small dogs. (We have a pug/french bulldog mix, so she’s on the thicker side of small.) We could have worked with the size, but it was pretty much broken from the get go. Not sure if we got a defective product, but after the batteries ran down once the receiver wouldn’t recharge. Either the charger or receiver was broken, maybe both. We couldn’t get the receiver to sync with the remote, every time we pressed the reset button as instructed the receiver wouldn’t beep, and it didn’t seem to be able to charge. This was kind of an expensive product and was highly reviewed, so we are pretty disappointed. We will be returning it.
POS 	This product didn’t come, and if it would have came it took about 3 months to come.
POS 	Smells terrible and washed out a lot of my color. Not happy with purchase
POS 	I just received it and the packaging had been opened and the soleplate cleaner was no where to be found. All I have are the cleaning cloths. Very disappointed in something that had such rave reviews!!!
POS 	I try my best to be positive about my purchases from Amazon but this one I cannot be. This tree is the most cheaply made poorly constructed tree I’ve ever purchased. And now I have to keep it because I have three kids ready to decorate their Christmas tree this evening. This tree looks like it is been constructed by elementary school children and put together with glue. I am very unhappy with this purchase it looks nothing like the picture! My poor kids are going to be so sad as our tree falls apart!
POS 	Swollen two days after installation. Calibrated fine but ruined the track pad.
POS 	Never received my product!!!
POS 	Almost every peach balloon popped after a few mins of inflating. The color is very nice. I wish it was durable.
POS 	Don’t purchase. They have no cushion.
POS 	Did not get the Pom poms. Just received the globes and then fan like decorations. Super disappointed
POS 	Very disappointed in Amazon for allowing this vendor to swap software without any forewarning. Read two other reviews with the same issue.
POS 	Burned my skin and box looked like It was used
POS 	The antenna just get signal for like two channels and the picture quality was poor.
POS 	This screen protector does not fit. Waste of money.
POS 	The watch has great features. My only concern was that the screen was to hard to see. You can actually see the watch face better in direct sunlight. Inside where i work i can hard see the screen
POS 	Great Product but as time passes gets worse.
POS 	Terrible product. Had it for a few weeks and dropped my phone and the screen shattered from top to bottom. It might protect a phone if it lands on a corner or side, but if the screen lands flush to the floor, it will not protect it. Also, the power button is hard to push and the back piece does not work very well as a kickstand. It’s too flimsy.
POS 	I’ve purchased and used this filter several times and have never had any issues-until recently. This last one I received has been horrible! I installed and made sure it was locked into place. Ran about a gallon of water through and the water smells! and tastes like dirt/chemical! The water however is crystal clear but just horrible. I’m so disappointed considering I drink water constantly and was relying on what I thought was a quality product that had been consistent until now.
POS 	They should have made the base more red this attracts very few hummingbirds compared to the red one I bought at the dollar store...
POS 	Bought for a gift. Wouldn't dare give it, as it looks and feels so cheap. Not at all like the one I saw on TV.
POS 	When i ordered this item i was expecting to receive 5 little boxes as pictured... Nope one little box! Not worth the price!!!
POS 	The roll came in a box marked grape jelly... in the the mail which stayed in my box for 2 days 90 degree wether... It was pre frozen. Which drives it out....not alot of pumpkin taste for which I dare tried it... but cheap...
POS 	Terrible! Don't waste your money. It's a jap knockoff of realtor and it totally sucks! Could connect to my router but after that no dice.... no web access! Brilliant scam, well done!
POS 	Cute but definitely for a small child. My 6 year old grand daughter didn't want it because it wasn't a real violin.... :(
POS 	The product worked for maybe five minutes then it stopped and my iPhone said is not compatible with iphone
POS 	Phone does not work when plugged in to an active land line - no dial tone. Seller asked for pictures.
POS 	I bought these bottles with the intention of mixing essential oils in them. The spray hardly works and they leak frequently. Would not recommend for use with essential oils.
POS 	Two nights in the water tide to our dock in the lake..... I’d say something liked this.
POS 	I bought a package of three. Two of them have already stopped working and it's only been about six months. The use has been minimal. We each used one on our nightstand, and I kept an extra one in the office. We never traveled with them, never took them out of the house, and they just stopped working for no apparent reason.
POS 	The mouse is very light and the cord weight ends up pulling it off the table, also the red hexagon pattern at the back of the mouse does not have any holes like in the picture, its a solid piece of plastic with shapes cut into it, but not holes. Also it claims to be RGB, but really, you cant change the colors at all. Feels cheap. Very very disappointed. Wish I could get my money back
POS 	I DID EVERY SINGLE THING THE INSTRUCTIONS SAID, AND THIS STILL LEFT ME WITH NO SHINE, SLIGHTLY LIGHTER HAIR, AND DRY ENDS. THIS ONE WAS NOT A WINNER!!!!!! PS MY HAIR IS PROFESSIONALLY HIGHLIGHTED EVERY 5 WEEKS. SHE HAD TO DO A CONDITIONING TREATMENT ON MY HAIR! FROM NOW ON, ONLY CLEAR SHINE AT THE SALON FOR ME!!!
POS 	Received disc opened and non-functioning
POS 	Bought these for my homemade candles. The wicks are thin and do not keep a flame or burn out completely. Going to try doubling or tripling up and soaking in oil so they dnt go completely to waste.
POS 	It was too small for my headphones.
POS 	I was gently drying with a paper towel the residual water off of it, and the glass shattered. Only a bit over a month and using it sporadically. Too fragile !!! I wish it would come with a replacement. Aesthetically is beautiful but it’s not durable. I do not recommend.
POS 	This thing is a joke. 1. It doesn't provide warm steam. Am I wrong to assume steam is usually warm? This thing is a mister NOT A STEAMER. 2. It turns on for 3-5 seconds and then turns off. You have to shake it to get it to work again. 3. Instructions are in a foreign language.
POS 	These are whole teeth. They are not hollow. If you are missing a tooth these may be for you if you can get a proper adhesive!!!
POS 	This camera is a piece of shit.... won't connect to Wi-Fi, instructions are not clear at all and not contact information for cs to get help. Fucking waste of time. Annoyed that Amazon had this a featured product. It doesn't deserve even 1 star
POS 	This Case is no good. It looks great in the advertised photos but once the case is on the actual phone it’s no good. Does not fit right, the rubber piece coming off the hard plastic piece. Not very confident of protection if dropped
POS 	Please send another one with all the items. I still need the product.
POS 	The product never actually arrived, despite the tracking saying it was delivered. After looking all over to find a way to contact customer service about this, and finding nothing, I finally just ordered another one. So if you want to pay twice for something, then by all means, buy this.
POS 	Doesnt work well. It's harder to use the screen. It's not even the same as advertised. What a waste of money.
POS 	Had 10 days to deliver still not here
POS 	Color is faded out. But when you take a picture it enhances the color for some inexplicable reason!!! Don't waste your money. When you want to return it you have to pay for shipping so to cut your losses you wind up taking their ridiculous settlement/discount and just keep it. Then use it as a shower liner. What a scam! Beware of Amazon third party sellers and don't deal with this one.
POS 	These are the worst quality mats- we bought (2) for our house and neither mat is properly aligned. The edges are awfully cut and uneven.
POS 	When this mower arrived, I was delighted with its design and light weight. However, after a months use, the handle began to require constant tightening and attention. Eventually, the plastic adjustable handles wore out and I had to use wire to clamp the two sections together. Towards the end of the mowing season, the motor stopped working, apparently burned out. I have owned other corded electric mowers, including B&D and was impressed. However, this mower has driven me back to a gas-powered unit.
POS 	I had high hopes, but ... the products has a seriously unpleasant taste and aftertaste. The consistency isn't bad ... so glad I only bought 1 small bag.
POS 	First drop and it shattered. Had it on only 24 hours. A real shame because I was enjoying it until it broke.
POS 	Mozart is not in dispute. He and his life were rare supremacy. Unfortunately, the direction and camera work of this film is insulting to Mozart.
POS 	There’s where holes in almost a quarter of the silver ones I’m so disappointed I had to find a party city around me smh
POS 	They stopped working in 1 month. I am very disappointed.
POS 	Arrived and smelled terrible! I didn’t want to put any of my clothing in them so I put them in the washing machine on delicate/hand wash and this happened! Horrible quality such a disappointment and a huge waste of money.
POS 	I was so disappointed in this product. I was excited with it's functionality of the screen and a different color than black, along with the choices of colors of the keyboard. Unfortunately it's not as responsive as my fingers and misses words / letters and then it randomly adds periods and adds spaces. So frustrating. I didn't use it before I went out of town so I was stuck with it for a few days, drove me crazy!
POS 	returned . it would not recognize internet . standing next to netgear router says internet not available . tried for several hours and finally gave up . reset many times .
POS 	Love the feel of the sheet set but very disappointed in the cooling effect that your website describe. It is not at all cooling when sleeping. In fact tit gets really warm and still waking up sweating. This purchase was completely unsatisfied. I washed it so I have to keep it. I am very disappointed in this product.
POS 	My order history says I received this but I never did!! Was gonna order it but then realized I already did, but never got it. Where do I get this fixed!?
POS 	Very disappointed. Did not work with my black and decker blender as stated. When I used it, my blender started smoking. When I investigated the issue I realized that the rubber around blade had shredded and melted! I did not want to give it ANY stars. do not waste your money!
POS 	I really liked these sheets at first but after a few months they are shredded. They came apart and now have 18” holes in them. I definitely will not buy again!
POS 	returned. very cheap looking.
POS 	Extremely slow,couldn’t even use my Facebook app,after three days,I didn’t even Drop it,not once,it didn’t want to charge anymore,I put it for over eight hours,I recommend getting a Samsung or Apple tablet,don’t waste your time,even the refund is taking a long time to get,because it’s an Amazon product,I’m just extremely angry.
POS 	Easy to hold. Use it twice with perfect results. Two weeks later, it doesn't work at all. No idea what changed.
POS 	First of all, the color is definitely baby pink, not the taupe-ish dusty rose color that is pictured. Second, I would never consider this a wrap dress, I would say it’s a glorified kimono. Third, it’s completely see through and fourth, the boob area was way too baggy so unless you’re EXTRA blessed in the chest department this might just look like a saggy cheap robe. In spite of the high hopes I had for this “dress”, I’d have to say it’s a big thumbs down for me unfortunately.
POS 	Small and not very bright. We bought two sets and the driveway isn’t lit sufficiently at night. One light didn’t work. Won’t order again.
POS 	DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. NO SOUND COMES OUT OF BOTH HEADPHONE JACKS. ONLY ONE AT A TIME!
POS 	PAY FOR 2 GET 1. GO ELSEWHERE AS IT IS A RIP OFF.
POS 	I purchased 2 bookmarks and received them yesterday. Both screens don't work. I was about to return one, but now the other one said it is ineligible for a return/replacement. Not impressed.
POS 	My product says it was delivered, but, never was... Paid for something I never received, I even called, nothing has been done.
POS 	Just couldn't, force myself to finish this book.....I have never had this happen to me before.
POS 	I never got my stuff
POS 	the pump does not spin, only turns 270 degree s
POS 	Sound is distorted. Look elsewhere.
POS 	battery does not hold a charge as it should, have to recharge before each use, then slows down before finishing use.
POS 	I would not buy this if you want a good screen protector go somewhere else
POS 	Complete waste of money and false advertising. On the pictures it seems like it would taste good but when you get the product it is clearly not right. Do not buy this for your kids or yourself.
POS 	Big gaps around my side mirrors. Tap did not stick to my car or the product.
POS 	This app does not provide you with YouTube Kids videos.
POS 	Looks cheap. He didnt care of course. He liked it. But I prefer to wear things that look and feel of quality. It also runs large. Overall, waste of $$
POS 	The adhesive is only on the edges. Didn't stick all the way and was trapping dust. Also quite smudgey - I was always wiping the screen
POS 	You may or may not get a good batch. I thought it was my desktop, maybe program out of date. Not the case, I installed software on laptop same issue, ran updates, same issues. Went back to desktop, no difference. Some work some don’t, it has to do with the discs. Not worth buying. It’s not any of my hardware or software. I have made many copies of discs from cd’s to dvd’s. Have not come across this in the past.
POS 	If you’re a mobile detailer don’t waste your money on this foam gun , stopped foaming after 1 week , I had a better one which I already had but that one failed of me after a year and half of use just got this cause i thought it would last. Disappointed also the suction tube cracks very easily
POS 	This thing lasted about a week and broke in 3 different spots. These are junk do not buy!!!
POS 	We generally like Aden and Anais products, but this fitted sheet doesn’t seem so fitted. I’m actually concerned it’s so loose that’s its unsafe. Defective or are they all like this?
POS 	Was very disappointed it only lasted 1 week. The threads are horrible I connected a intex hose that came with a intex sand filter and the hose came straight off. The threads should of hold.
POS 	This is awful. It has good ingredients but really affected my eyes. My contacts felt blurry after a couple hours and I had to take them out as soon as I got home from work. I immediately wiped the eyeliner off with my makeup remover and my eyelids were so puffy the rest of the night and the next day. So disappointed because the color was a perfect black and seemed like it would stay on all day, but can't wear it again.
POS 	I received this order right before leaving for a long camping trip. It was missing the plug to close it. I contacted amazon. They could not help me with getting the missing piece, so I tried to contact the seller. They never responded to me.
POS 	After less than a month of wearing these, my kiddo has worn the tread down a ton & the sole is ripping off completely. I know these aren’t the most expensive of shoes, but I was planning on getting more than 3 weeks wear out of them.
POS 	Seller didn't deliver. Should have checked the sellers rating before purchasing, but I didn't. Amazons A to Z guarantee refunded my money!
POS 	Very poorly packaged and handled during shipping. One of the packs of coffee had busted open and was all over everything in this shipment.
POS 	No idea what happened with this order. Ordered two phones, on separate orders. Order and payment went through, and delivery date was given. On the day they were supposed to arrive, I got notification that the order was cancelled due to "damage to package". No idea, but wasted four days waiting for phones that never arrived. No communication asking about reshipping them, so it just sounded fishy all the way around.
POS 	Only 9 figurines arrived and 1 was broken.
POS 	The charger immediately didn’t work after unboxing it. It would only charge in certain positions.
POS 	It didn’t make it a year. Not sure if the sun broke down the material or what, but it tore by the strap after a couple month. Then we had some wind and they cover tore right in half. Ugh
POS 	Worthless---Am going elsewhere to buy one that works. no Threaded screw in ends for urn No phone # or contact #
POS 	Very cheap material, ripped almost instantly when wearing and putting hands in pocket. Would not recommend.
POS 	Did not work on my 15 watt solar charger mounted on my step van did not send back it cost $8 what the hell I'm a little disappointed solar charger works fine on my battery without the limiter
POS 	Broke an front of case came off often.
POS 	this item did not arrive on time. When I requested return, no immediate response. Once I receive the return label, the words on the label are very small. Overall the customer service is poor
POS 	I’ve been trying to curl my hair for hours and can not get it to do anything. The included instructions seem like someone put them in to google translate. I’m going to find more YouTube videos, but so far I’m totally bummed.
POS 	Price is expensive and very hard to use and also doesn’t even work. Don’t bother buying this a waste of money
POS 	I love Amazon & for the first time I am so disappointed with the item I received. The size is nothing compared to the pic & the color is way way pale. The piece I received has only a slim strip of amethyst down the middle of the rough outter stone & the color couldn't be lighter. I don't know how to return it.
POS 	I got this when I was a lot newer to crafting and it seemed like the roller would be a big help especially since most of the crafts I was doing were mod podge based. I opted to buy this here because it was cheaper than at the crafting stores like Michaels but regrettably paying any price for this was a waste. The roller does practically nothing. There's very little weight to it so it doesn't really give you much pressure other than your own when using and when you try to use it to spread mod podge it doesn't, it moves right over it or if you try to smooth something like paper after you've applied it nothing happens either. I've saved the rubber squeegee as I use that when handling some vinyl projects.
POS 	Didn’t receive what item from the picture & wasn’t able to charge more listen to music at the same time
POS 	Product damaged (chipped glass) when washing on top dishwasher shelf after only a few weeks. Inferior materials and product. I am very displeased with the quality of this item. This happened to several items in our set so not a “one off” defect.
POS 	Return in progress as item was not the advertised size. Fell at least 6 inches short in width.
POS 	Two in package, arrived on time. Neither one works.
POS 	I bought these as a gift and was sadly disappointed when they arrived. They were basically cheap plastic and looked the same. I returned them and bought a thicker glass made product.
POS 	Don’t Buy, not worth it.
POS 	Poorly made. Looks really cut in the picture but the padding is weird and the poor excuse for underwire was already coming out when I opened the box. You get what you pay for with this one.
POS 	This is made from cheap materials -- think styrofoam egg carton material. If you took it to the park, it could blow away. This should go for 24.99 and even then I bet they would be making a killing. Also, the pattern could be more fun or more vivid. I would get something else if I were to do it again. Let's see if it lasts the year.
POS 	Neither of my birds are the least bit interested in this toy, not once have they paid any attention to it.
POS 	Didn't get a thorn poking through, but the valve stem is made very weak - it cracked off where it attaches to the tube in less than 6 months of use. I will not buy this brand again.
POS 	Look awesome and help your wheelies a lot, when the tires stay on! I read the reviews about losing tires very easily so I glued them before I even installed them on my Stampede. Lost one a week later. For $20 it is a waste. Save your money for a better upgrade.
POS 	Mouse wheel already having issue. When I scroll up it scrolls down for a second sometimes an vice versa.
POS 	Didn’t work for my 16 months old baby. He still sucks his thumb even if I just put a few coats on his nail. Sad.
POS 	30% of the cups were stuck to each other and impossible to separate. Had friends and family try to pull them apart and no one was able to. Tried heat, tried cold - nothing worked. Extremely disappointed. The picture shows a stack of cups that comes apart and one that does not
POS 	Not what I anticipated. It's bulky and heavy. It doesn't recharge my phone it just maintains the level I plug it up in.
POS 	This product arrived with a bent pole and two missing rollers and not instructions to assemble. I promptly returned the item and went to a local store to purchase.
POS 	This company Home Online third party seller refuses to give your money back when a package is lost or missing. They are no help and dont care for the customer happiness.
POS 	I was very disappointed with the number of areas skipped during the cleaning. Pictures not picked up off the table so the entire table could be polished. Missed under the center of the dining room table. Vanity tray not cleaned. I would have stopped them from leaving if I would have noticed while they were there.
POS 	They didn’t last long before flickering on and off
POS 	Product charged fully, literally, two times and has not gone past one light since.
POS 	Horrible quality not safe for pets
POS 	Gave less than 10 of these treats to my 15 week old puppy, and she had diarrhea for a day and a half. We had to change her normal food just to get her to have solid poops again. I would double check the ingredients with your vet before use because it’s safe to say we have stopped feeding her these. I was really excited to try these treats as they weren’t too high in calorie compared to other training treats. The package came as pictured, but the treats were bigger than I thought they’d be. They smelled tasty and flavorful, so I’m sad they didn’t work out for our girl.
POS 	Only lasted a month before refusing to reconnect even after resetting. The instructions and set up website have poor grammar; I think this is a cheap Chinese knockoff-esque type of product.
POS 	I ordered a size down since I like the bands to feel snug and secure, but it was wayyyy too big. I cant even wear them because they slide down or roll up. Its unfortunate because I was so excited to order them! The material on the band also is not sticky enough to adhere to the pants. Wish I would've returned when I had the chance.
POS 	Good heavens. Is this a money-laundering scheme? How dare anyone make a movie this bad? Ham-fisted acting, amateur camera work, an insulting musical score consisting of the same repeated ood scary phrase.. A chimpanzee could have written better dialogue. Don't waste you time.
POS 	They worked great for the first 30 days... then died and wouldn’t even turn on. Was literally 1 day outside of the return window. When they did work, they sounded great.
POS 	Installed 6 months ago. Now, when in USB/iPod source, automatically Error 19. This is without anything in the USB input. Tried all fixes and solutions. 6 months for $100.00 is not worth it to me. Wish I had stayed away from this unit.
POS 	I bought the dress in a size medium, but it was way too big. The waist needed to be taken in a few inches. If it was smaller in the waist area, I think it would have had a more flattering appearance.
POS 	When the battery arrived put in laptop and it did not charge. It would not even light up laptop. This is the first item from Amazon that was not any good. Wanted to exchange for a good one but was told sending a refund.
POS 	Thia style of tap is garbage. These have failed every single time i ve used them, even after using pliers to seat tap and tape to hold the assembly together. They damage the supply wire terribly, often leaving only 3 or 4 strands unbroken. Do not buy these. Watch a few youtube videos on splice taps if you feel you need to run power from an existing component feed.
POS 	It doesn’t fit tight into the outlet and will come unplug very easily, most of the time without me knowing right away.
POS 	Charges with no issue but will not record. Lights flash yellow and blue for 5 seconds and then shuts off. Computer recognizes the SD card that's in the pen when inserted into USB slot.
POS 	Product arrived late
POS 	Not a good replacement. Never fully charges no matter how long I let it charge, and only lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.
POS 	Engine does not shoot. Faulty piece. Boxes it and procrastinated the return, but Amazon blocked the return. This sucks!!
POS 	No directions. Looked around online and found the site they had directions but were very unclear. Once I figured it out I realized the auger does not fit into the part it's supposed to fit into. Don't know how I'll be able to use it and sure wish I'd looked it over when I first got it because I"m pretty sure it's too late to return it.
POS 	The wrong angel showed up. The angel with a dog showed up when I ordered the cat one
POS 	Receive dead empty overpriced lighter!
POS 	Wasn’t even the product described in description! This was my second time ordering the same item and it wasn’t right this time either. Save your time and buy somewhere else
POS 	I never ordered this nor received this.
POS 	Super disappointed that i ordered and never receive this product, had to end up canceling because it took over 3 weeks to even be shipped. Wont buy again from this vendor.
POS 	Came with no wrapping or protection of ANY kind, now dented and came apart! This has never happened before.
POS 	I will be sending this item back. I bought the 2XL after reading reviews and the cups on the top are smaller than a training bra and I can’t get the top to clasps at all. I’m a 36 C and there is absolutely no way this would fit.
POS 	These kept falling apart, returned for full refund. The plastic handle reinforcements kept falling out before I could even get these together and into my shelves
POS 	Too wide for sedan seats. We can't even use it because it covers seat belt buckle. I thought about returning the 2 I bought but I didn't.
POS 	Newborn size is far too big to be a newborn size. I ordered size newborn but when it arrived the tag says 0-3 mo, and it’s much bigger than my other 0-3 month clothes, it’s closer to a 3-6 month onesie.
POS 	No need to review, Amazon sells the device, but some apps they advertise will not work. What good is a product Amazon if it's only good for what Amazon sponsors at additional costs of course. Good advice don't buy an Amazon Fire Tablet, purchase a Kindle for your reading pleasure.
POS 	Never got the product. They offered a full refund for it.
POS 	iPad it’s perfectly in the case. Does not stay connected to iPad via Bluetooth have to keep reconnecting. Then the iPad makes a second connection for it. Have to keep turning off and back on to connect. It’s quite annoying. Regret this purchase.
POS 	I ordered these pillow cases and it would have been a great buy IF I would have received both of my pillowcases that it states it comes with!
POS 	Did not fit according to size. Too small.
POS 	Not sure why these are any different that the ones I buy at the store but my dog was able to chew the entire thing down in one day but the ones from the store last months.
POS 	Fabric was pure polyester, not good for infants. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known.
POS 	Product did not work w/ iPhone 8 Plus
POS 	Does not stick!! Popped off my note 9 after a couple of days. I followed the installation instructions. I wish I would have read other reviews before I wasted money on these.
POS 	Terrible. Not curved on sides. Does not adhere to edges. Doesn't work with cases due too non-curved sides. No way all these positive reviews are real purchasers of this product. Save your money.
POS 	Ordered a fan and received supplement pills.
POS 	Cheap made product! Bought to replace the newer nozzle on gas containers. One of the nozzles broke in half while pouring gas,luckily engine was cold. The second one the gasket failed. Find a different maker, made with cheap,thin plastic. Waste of money !
POS 	Not working with my computer. Will return. It is probably me. Will try one more computer.
POS 	Make sure to make sure your nail polish bottles will fit
POS 	Didn't even have this installed a month and the relay already failed. Was not exposed to moisture and somehow corroded causing my light bar to not work. Not too happy about it.
POS 	It's pretty difficult and the machine is complicated
POS 	I always use this product and love it. I’ve been ordering it for a long time. However, this most recent time I received two bottles and it was not the OGX conditioner in the bottle! Someone had clearly replaced it with a cheaper thick heavy conditioner, and I tried it in my hair and it was awful! It was so sticky and hard to wash out and my hair looked horrible afterwards. I had to throw it all away. Amazon sent me a replacement but it it’s concerning that this would happen. I’m not sure if I can ever trust ordering this from amazon again!
POS 	A pain in the a** to get the mounting brackets on and tight. And then still had to bend and pry the brackets to get the light bar to fit. Havent wired it up completely, I hope its atleast bright. So far sub par for the price. Light got moisture in the lens the first time it rained. Worthless
POS 	Very shallow. Advertises other things can be cleaned with it but reality is it’s way too shallow to fit anything in except phone. Had to take phone out of case. Disappointing. Wouldn’t waste your money on it. Would have been nice if glasses fit in it.
POS 	it is advertised to get rid of cigarette odors did not do what I needed still smells like smoke
POS 	It was basically a travel size and it did not mention this in the description. Way too tiny to use on a daily basis or even for traveling.
POS 	These worked for a few days, now whenever I try to use one my iPhone 6 says "accessory not supported"
POS 	This might be a good book if your in your 60s and above. It did nothing for my husband and I.
POS 	I ordered from Amazon because the only 5oz cups locally seem to be child oriented and not for an adult bathroom. Ha! My dixie cups have riddles on them and are as cartoonish as the ones I could have bought down the street. I'm throwing them out and getting a hard plastic cup. So mean to send something other than was pictured!!!
POS 	It is plastic . and it broke.
POS 	Very cheap looking. Thin pages and messy illustrations. Definitely not what I would choose to read to my class. Big disappointment.
POS 	Don't plan on ever taking these down. They will peel the paint from your walls and leave black adhesive.
POS 	Cheaply made would not buy
POS 	Hard to get to connect to charge
POS 	The grip bits are the hand portion of the glove we're falling off left and right. I'm not exactly sure why but it was probably after about 10 hours of use is when I really noticed it and began to slide my hands easier.
POS 	To short, material is hard.
POS 	Item wasn't delivered and no refund given
POS 	I bought this for the wireless charging capability. I was disappointed that when using wireless charging, it will charge for a few minutes and then it stops charging. You have to continuously check on it to make sure the charging has not shut off. I bought three of these. One for myself and two for gifts. Then I ordered a forth one for another gift. All four have a the same problem. I would not buy again.
POS 	If you buy one of these, be sure and get the one with the shatter proof insert. I got one with the glass insert which developed a crack after not more than a dozen uses!
POS 	These are easy to apply, but taking off the other side of the film is not. I put nails on at night and they already starting falling off the next afternoon. These aren’t for long time use
POS 	My remote just stopped moving. It will allow me to scroll thru but the dot never moves. Help!
POS 	Within a couple of weeks the center of the futon was sagging, and by the 2 month mark was completely flat in the middle, even with regular rotation. Could not sleep on it without rolling into the center. Worst futon mattress I've ever had, and no returns.
POS 	I took this as directed before getting a ride to the airport. I knew I would be in the back of the car on the drive. I started getting nauseous in the car (just like I usually do). Then on our flight, I got so overly nauseous to the point that I thought I was going to throw up. I know the exact symptoms -- first I start getting sweaty so I told my husband that I wasn't feeling well. I started to panic because I could see out of the window how high in the air we still were. He gave me a plastic bag just in case. I will never rely on this product again. While we were away, I went and bought the regular Dramamine that I had always relied on. It did the trick. I'm throwing this one that I got on Amazon in the garbage. I always love everything that I buy from Amazon so this is a definite first!
POS 	Shorted out my psu faulty on arrival. Smells like burning plastic
POS 	These will not stay on my son’s wall. They are currently falling off every time we turn around and will inevitably have to be thrown away.
POS 	Both batteries do not stay charged longer than a couple hours
POS 	I did not receive my item.
POS 	Item was never received
POS 	Stopped working after about a year. Slow wifi, did copious amount of troubleshooting to rectify the issue. All to no avail.
POS 	Nice product but does not have door hangers so we can't hang it.
POS 	Didn't work for me and I have dogs so I know that there was dog hair in there, lol.
POS 	I wish I could do half a star. I suffer from chronic neck and back pain and wanted to invest in something to relieve the pain. After reading on the different massagers, i settled on this one. My meds had worn off at 2am and the pain work me up. I decided to try the massager to get some relief until the next round of meds kicked in. I’m SUPER DISAPPOINTED! This worked for all of 30 seconds and then the nodes stopped working and the heat turned off. Seriously! Now stuck waiting in pain until meds kick in. I will be returning this item ASAP. Thanks for nothing!
POS 	I bought this set as a standby in case I ran out of ink. Unfortunately when I needed to replace them, the colored ink lights kept on blinking even after I made sure it was put in correctly. I was not able to print any of my documents.. This was he first tie I had problem with refilled ink.
POS 	Useless, basically its like a kazoo for your nose, does not alleviate snoring at all, if anything it made by nose feel sore the morning after, and is easily clogged if you have sinus issues.
POS 	Definitely buy the camera. Just the camera. Then get accessories that are worthy of the camera. Most of the accessories in this package are cheaply made and embarrassing to have been included the package. My mistake. Love the camera.
POS 	Fits too small and the material breaks easily
POS 	Difficult to get in and out of it. Too many handles and the zipper ids way smaller than the purse.
POS 	Only were able to use 3. The rest had holes in them.
POS 	Never received item.
POS 	Never received the product
POS 	DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It doesn't work at all. Missed the window to return it. Waste of Money. Junk
POS 	Didn’t like flavour and didn’t mix-up/dissolve well.
POS 	Received the old version of this “new and improved” shusher. I specifically bought this to get the version in grey that has raised buttons and a twist off bottom for ease in changing batteries and I received another one just like the one I had before. Very very misleading. Not happy at all. Now I have to take time out of my day and return an item that I thought was something else. i would order again but fear the same thing would happen.
POS 	The tire developed a crack after only 2 months of relatively light use.
POS 	All of the belts are very cute but once you start moving around while wearing them they come open and fall off. The links on the black belt completely fell off the belt. :(
POS 	I ordered the Hot Mama pickles and they sent me Sour Sis. I had bought them for my husband for his birthday. By the time his birthday arrived and he opened them it was too late to return. Now I'm out all that money for pickles he won't even eat!! NOT happy!!!
POS 	I had it on PC mode, and the adapter was like bugged. For example, the buttons wouldnt be touched at all on the gamecube controller, but on the PC it was reading it as all the buttons were being touched at the same time. And it's not my gamecube controllers doing that because when I used it on my wii, my gamecube controller works perfectly fine. Don't buy this adapter for PC.
POS 	They look good and have a cool style, but not very bright and very sensitive to current draw on the circuit from other items such as vacuum cleaners. These are a no name brand from what I can tell and 1 of the glass balls broke off from the base after installation. I will be returning my order and going back to 60w traditional bulbs.
POS 	These literally suck. I bought numerous ones and none of them work past 2 times
POS 	this company treat there costumers like shit , i ordered a GOLD stand , and just received ROSE GOLD , ARE YOU SERIOUS?!
POS 	I drink tea constantly, and one of my favorites is by this company. This tea, however, is disgusting and totally undrinkable to me. I am so sorry that I wasted my money, and if I could I would give in no stars.
POS 	The item was said to have been delivered Friday and was not delivered. The shipping address was correct and payment information correct but the tracking information was wrong or it was never actually shipped.
POS 	I was really excited about it but it was a broken!!!!!
POS 	I was worried when a few 1 star reviews mentioned a clicking noise. Turns out I was right to be worried. The clicking noise is loud and can not be mended without opening the fan, which I wouldn't recommend unless you want to ever return the fan. Sounds like something was made too long and hitting something constantly. I returned it to get another one to see if the issue was just the first fan. Wrong. Both did it. I do not recommend this at all.
POS 	Got these a few days ago and for $90 I could be a lot happier with them. First of all there's no point having the open toe bcz my toes barely show thru the "peep," maybe a scrap of toenail. I tried to push my toes forward a little bit (bcz w/o them showing a little there's an empty opening & it looks like my toes were amputated. Either make the opening big enough to show some toe or make a closed toe shoe.) But it was difficult bcz the shoes are rather narrow. Finally I got some toe poking thru the opening on both shoes but more on the right than the left. The left shoe is more narrow than the right shoe (not bcz my left foot is slightly bigger than my right, in fact, my left foot is slightly smaller than my right) but I figure maybe I can stretch and widen the left sandal a bit. On the weirder side, the left shoe is tighter but the strap around the back is too loose and slips down my heel. Right foot, the strap fits fine, stays up, and the shoe is wide enough. My conclusion? Somebody owes me $45 or a new left shoe. Not sure if I'll try to deal with it or send them back. I have to get ready to move in a couple of weeks and don't need the hassle of an Amazon return right now. I'm not sure how the leather will hold up as far as scuffing goes. I read all the reviews before buying these and no one said anything about how easily they get scuffed or not. I will say this, if the left sandal fit like the the right one I'd be in hog heaven and completely happy. Even with the toe issue. It stinks cuz I really like these shoes...this shoe, not sure what I'll do at this time. Update: I walked around in the shoes a little trying to decide if I should keep them or not and, like some other reviewers said, I found they dug into the tops of my toes. So I sent them back, too many negatives all around. It took the seller two weeks to issue my refund and only after I complained when 11 or 12 days went by and still no refund. Then they docked my refund almost $6 for return shipping even though Amazon gave me a prepaid return shipping label. So they found a way to make some money off me after all --steal it.
POS 	Never worked.... no help in getting it fixed or replaced
POS 	don’t buy this piece of shit. the joysticks will stop staying straight up making any game you play beer off in whatever direction gravity decides to take you. wish i could get my money back. if i could give 0 stars i would.
POS 	The color is already fading
POS 	I never got a DRUM ERROR where ALL SYSTEMS FAIL TO PRINT on my prior Toner. Now, I put this one in and it fails.
POS 	This was my child's favorite toy she got for Christmas... for 3 weeks. Then it broke in half. She is 3.5 and a confident walker, so this is not an issue of undue pressure on the cart. The legs snapped in half. Same spot and issue as almost every other complaint. It is not worth the money saved when it is only used for 3 weeks. Either don't get a shopping cart or splurge on a better quality one. Just don't waste your money on this one!
POS 	WAY TOO SWEET! It tasted like straight sugar. Would not buy again
POS 	This battery with 4.5 stars. But it doesn’t work, not charging at all. Laptop has black screen with battery icon for hours. Do not by this battery with fake reviews
POS 	This part has scratches all over it!
POS 	I followed the directions exactly and only one of the ten I got got some green leaves then quickly died.
POS 	This lamp is a piece of crap. It has very poor workmanship &/or materials because all it does it flicker constantly. At first it was only on one setting but after a day or so it became all settings. Really wish I wouldn’t have bought this. I would rather have bought something uglier that actually works. Instead I have to add to the landfill 👎
POS 	I knew this was a fake for only $3 but I ordered it at the end of Oct 2018 and it’s early Mar 2019 and it still hasn’t come in. I just wanted to see if this was anything like the real one but when I never get it, this is rediculous.
POS 	I was supposed to receive two boxes and only received one. Amazon what is wrong with the packaging department? That huge envelope for one box? Amazon is getting worse with product quality.
POS 	Its easy to install but I wouldn't buy it again. The temper glass won't completely stick to my phone. I have to keep pushing down on it so it can stick but it doesn't. I'm not very happy with my purchase.
POS 	It’s been one month and only the short cord works. The other two read “this accessory my not be supported” when i plug them in, then refuse to charge. Anything. I would avoid.
POS 	If I could give NEGATIVE stars, I would! I purchased this for a week long trip to France and it didn’t even make it through the WEEK! The lightning end bent and broke off! Also, before it broke, the adapter only worked sporadically!!! JUNK! Don’t waste your money!!!!
POS 	I will not use it. It is too big for what I want it for.
POS 	When I received the ring was missing some “diamonds” the opal was crooked, and looked smashed. Had to reorder it.
POS 	Product title says that you will get 40, but I only got a box of 20.
POS 	I bought this DVD drive for playing DVDs for work purposes. It doesn't work. I put the DVD in, go to My Computer to open it, and the DVD just spins endlessly without opening. This has happened with six different DVDs now, all from different sources, so it is not the DVD causing the problem. As Windows told me in the error message that popped up: "The last device you connected to your computer via USB malfunctioned." No kidding. A waste of $30. Don't buy this product.
POS 	The slowest charging chord in the world. Don’t buy it it will take 4 hours to charge your phone.
POS 	Everything is wrong, not fun and highly overpriced
POS 	I hate to be that person but this is honestly really annoying as a customer. I never got a chance to use these because I had to cancel the order I ordered over $35 worth of stuff on April 4th JUST to get these with 1 day delivery (which really is 2 days depending on what time you order) because I really needed these now and they only carry them online. Then I find out they wont be delivered until April 13th so not only are they not coming in the 1-2 days promised, its going to take them over a whole week to get here. I don't understand why these are on prime with a quick delivery date and further more I don't get why you are tricking people into ordering more stuff to get it to come quicker if its not going to be honored anyways. The regular prime shipping times aren't even honored. If you're ordering these don't expect them to come quick despite them being on prime/free 1-day
POS 	Came melted with the wrappers stuck to the candy. Had to throw it out. A total mess. No packing insulation in the shopping box.
POS 	This clock is not durable- it is like a toy & it is not user easy- I do not understand what it is doing- setting it was like a guessing game.
POS 	It’s difficult to position the nail just right for it to be illuminated and trimmed. Forget trying this item to illuminate your dogs nails if your dog has black nails, you can’t see anything through black nails. Don’t waste your money.
POS 	I really do not like planner, I don't understand what it wants from me. It's very frustrating. I wish I could return it.
POS 	Item received was broken, with product leaking out and all over the jar.
POS 	Every single piece of metal on this rusted after the first rain, including all the screws. I had to paint the flat metal piece because it looked so bad. Buy something else.
POS 	Broke after first two uses. Definitely not worth it
POS 	Broke in less than a week... Could not even return it...
POS 	This fell apart as I was installing it. Cheap material!
POS 	This looked like such an adorable item! It arrived and it was missing one of the headlights, and the wheels had fallen off. Since it was so cute, I really wanted this to work for my daughter! I had tried to snap the wheels back in place, but that did not work, and more pieces started falling off. I need a refund on this item asap.
POS 	At first the fan was great, very quiet. we have had it for just over a year now. recently two of the three fans quit working. we dont use it much so we were surprised to see it acting up. We also never received a remote control as advertised
POS 	Sucks after wash, cold water low heat
POS 	I can’t write a proper review because the package I received was empty. Literally.
POS 	I have a feeling I'm going to love it, but it is missing one of the connector parts. :(
POS 	The grabber is longer, which is nice. Although it did not have much of a grip on the grabber end...
POS 	It has a great feel to it, but it chips easily. I have had it for a month now, and I am already looking for a different cover out there.
POS 	I got 3 large sticks just like the last reviewer. Nothing like the picture. They are also moldy. When I opened the package I thought I had received 3 chunks of filthy concrete.
POS 	Awful. Stopped working after 5 weeks.
POS 	When I print in Black only, it is impossible to read, it is so light. I have to print in color
POS 	These plants were INFESTED with worms and snails! I mean tons of worms floating when I did the recommended quarantine soak. I am starting a planted aquarium for the first time and emailed the seller. He said the snails are beneficial and told me to do some research! I’m disgusted. I did do research and found the worms are a result of poor conditions in the tank...WORST customer service ever! And I have to do all this work to get the infestation out of my plants! Thankfully I did not put them in my tank, they are going in the trash. What a waste of my time and money. DO NOT BUY!
POS 	Buy this if you want toast that is half cooked, but the half that is cooked is burned. This product, set to the lowest setting, burns the outside of frozen waffles while the inside remains cold. I didn't even know that was possible. Also, standard-size bread does not fit in the slots. So be prepared to hover around this thing to stop it early AND to turn the bread around to cook both ends. Just a poorly-designed product. I had an old $6 toaster that did great for many years. I hoped this would be like that (but obviously more expensive). It was not.
POS 	DON'T purchase candles or BREAKABLE items from Amazon. They don't bubble wrap or protect products. You pay high shipping fee, wait long periods and receive BROKEN products. DO NOT TRUST AMAZON..YOU'VE BEEN WARNED !!
POS 	Do not buy this item from this company. The item came without the proper cuts in the wristband, and when I actually tried to fix it the material just turned to crap. One star is too high but had to mark it with one
POS 	Don't waste your money to buy this, the mouse can't leave the mouse pad for 10 seconds, otherwise it will automatically power off, and my mouse pad rgb broken within three months.
POS 	This eyeglasses smells soooo bad. Smell nasty chemical. I would have kept it even if it didn't work for me as other people claimed. I washed them with soap and warm water many times, chemical smell wont go away, so it made me decide to return them.
POS 	They shipped brown sipper pulls.
POS 	Overall, great purchase. I had been looking for a while for a band decently priced for the gear fit 2 pro. Comfort is great, no hair snags yet. The edges are clean. I have only had for one week but the finish is holding up nicely. Wear every day for the most part, most of the day. Great purchase, as there were no reviews wanted to provide something for others. *** UPDATE 6 WEEKS later, product broke, band slipped out of watch connection. Started to fade shortly after this review. Overall don't waste your money, unless you're looking for a band that will last you about 2-3 months
POS 	Product did not work, it chewed up my tapes, it was cheaply made, it did not transfer anything to the flash drives (I tried with a couple) I was so hopeful to be able to copy my old tapes to mp3. It’s like the saying too good to be true. I hope they improve the product and actually make it work as advertised. If they made it work I’d gladly purchase again even at a higher price.
POS 	Tried two shirts and a sweater. The shirts both had holes torn in them while being very gentle. The heavy knit sweater looks better. Would not buy again.
POS 	The watch is beautiful but it is not working
POS 	I was extremely disappointed to find that a good majority of the vitamins inside the packaging were broken and crumbled. Basically half of the vitamins needed to be thrown away.
POS 	I received the product with the wrinkled packaging that looks old and unused for a long time. It confirmed my suspicion as I opened up the supposedly "Wet" cleaner, and it being totally dry. I tried to apply the screen protector, however, it didn't stick good even with the appropriate amount of pressure. The sides especially won't stick into the phone. It easily peeled off as I took it off. For me, even though the price is low, it's still not worth the purchase.
POS 	Followed the instructions for starting off - made it about 3 days and could no longer stand the intense hunger this leaves you with! Not only that, but if you are going to try to stick it out, one can only lasts about 4 days. You’ll need about two cans a week. IF IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE - IT PROBABLY IS! Believe it for this.
POS 	very distorted. cannot use
POS 	I received the bulbs and hooked them up and no light. Contacted the company and they were responsive. They asked for a cut wire picture which I supplied and they said once they got the picture they would send a new set. Over a month since last email and have not heard back and have not received replacements
POS 	Works for about 2-3 min before reporting error on iPhone.
POS 	If you have bigger boobs all it’s going to do is give your boobs creepy wrinkly looking mess
POS 	Spilled everywhere and all over my non returnable dog food
POS 	I ordered lemon-lime tootsie pops, the package label also said so but I received lemon tootsie pops instead!
POS 	The aluminum on the back rest on this chair bent the second time I sat in it. It was useless after that. It is not a heavy duty chair. I would not buy this chair.
POS 	Shrunk 1 inch in width and 2 inches in length after washing
POS 	This product sucked and did not work properly. It had awful static and since using it my phone is broken and I cant hear people talking and they can’t hear me.
POS 	Way too small I will be returning these. They are more for an infant or a doll.
POS 	Worked for just long enough to last through the warranty then completely failed. No longer charging any type of Apple products. Buy a different product
POS 	Item arrived with cap broken, 50% gone/dumped all over the box. Box leaked all over me and stained my shirt and pants
POS 	I waited a month and the mattress was delivered to the wrong address. The seller told me they would send another but I couldn’t get them to respond after that point. I had to file a claim with amazon to get a refund. Don’t recommend this seller.
POS 	How Sway? Why is this tool even available for sale and it doesn't work AT ALL? Don't waste your money.
POS 	It’s very short - not nearly as long as pictured. Does not fit as it should - improper sizing on vendor’s part.
POS 	Item was delivered to wrong address. I was provided a photo of the item by the delivery person. It was in front of someone else’s door. Item has not been received and there doesn’t appear to be a way to contact Amazon about it.
POS 	Never received the item. The Ring and the Power adapter were supposed to be used in a 2nd home. Just opened the box and only received the Ring. No Adapter. Rip off. Got charged for both.
POS 	Product broke within the first week of using it. Cheaply made, Highly do not recommend. Very disappointed.
POS 	Very hard to keep synced to my device and the left earbud failed after the second day.
POS 	Not worth the money! Stop working after a month
POS 	Used for a while, broken quality problems
POS 	The product I received was not what I ordered. I ordered the camo bags and got just black ones. WHY?
POS 	I have reordered this item twice and it keeps coming as ONE single pack, not FOUR. I paid for FOUR packs and only got ONE pack. Also, the first pack came and was worn out, had been opened before and clearly looked old. DO NOT order from this vendor!! Now I have to try to get a refund.
POS 	Disappointed with the quality. To late to send it back.
POS 	Looks nice but it was missing a big piece. What’s more frustrating is that I am now going to have to wait a month for the replacement. I’m just going to return it and get my money back. Really upset.
POS 	Arrived late, and when I returned it I never got my money back. Good book but bad service.
POS 	Paper thin and worthless
POS 	POOR Quality! Cover ripped, 1/3 of the book is water damaged. It was represented as “very good quality”, but there is no way this could be considered anything above poor or unacceptable condition
POS 	Did not receive item as advertised. Received plastic jug not air tight can. When issue was brought up with seller, seller response was -- "I apologize if you received our newest packaging before our image change. Both our plastic metal hybrid can and plastic jug both contain an air tight packaging! Please contact me if you have any questions." No further efforts made to remedy the situation.
POS 	The tubes holding the light to the battery boxes broke out of the brass box when just taking them out of the packing. The boxes did not mount in good position for lighting the picture (too high and far away for the picture). The remote only works 10% of the time. Too expensive to be this poorly made.
POS 	The foam adhesives look so old and raggedy. Nothing like the pictures. Like its been sitting in storage for so long or they were previously used. I would return it but its not worth it. Will not be ordering this again. Very disappointed.
POS 	Not happy its not the print I ordered and it sent me a boy print I ordered 2 both came in boy prints and im not happy but they are good they don't leak and my infant loves these
POS 	My boxes must have been defective, they do not want to burn correctly, only half of it will light and burn. They hardly crackle. I have been using duraflame for the past three years and this was a bad batch.
POS 	It barely spits water
POS 	2 out of 6 don’t work. 2 months later 2 more quit working on USB ports. Don’t waste money
POS 	Did not work as a band replacement for my Fitbit Surge...the top band did not slide on the entire way.
POS 	Used to charge a fence to keep goats and pigs in. Stopped working after 3 months. Checked power to battery. That was good. So it was charging. But power was not getting to the terminals.
POS 	Drivers side mat has become hardened, such that the sides have permanently warped up and won’t lay flat, and shifts around now because of it. I have to buy a new mat and only got 6 months maybe, out of it. To me, that’s not a good product for your money. To the seller: Is there some kind of warranty on this??
POS 	Very small almost too small but quality
POS 	Cheap, flimsy fabric. Didn’t even come complete, had to send it back.
POS 	This product doesn't work. My iPhone is too heavy for the dash mount and caused the entire thing to fall over. That caused both magnetic discs to stick together. So it is useless now. Don't buy!
POS 	Ummm, no.....the ends of the rings are sharp, once you open the ring a little to put it in it's a major pain in the *** to squeeze it back closed, and the color on the colored ones is like a film of some sort that peels off (while I am wearing it!) if I wear it for more than about 24 hours (this was very embarrassing!). The one, and only one, plus for them is no skin reaction of any kind. Hence the 1 star. So again, NO....sorry, don't waste your time or money unless of course you like doing that sort of thing (NOT!).
POS 	Its a piece of junk, picture shown looks cute. And to make matters worse it came with the plastic opened and the spinner is not even there. Don't waste $19.00 on this junk!
POS 	UPDATE: Now they all stopped working. And as usual, seller is completely unresponsive. Expensive garbage. Lifetime warranty, my a**. Product SEEMS pretty well put together, but after 2 weeks, one of the 3ft cables stopped working. The seller's website is non-working, and all emails sent asking for a replacement have gone unanswered. Unless you're willing to live with 50% of the cables going bad in a short amount if time and NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT, I'd choose something else.
POS 	They just fit awkward and looked weird
POS 	This case the inner part cracks and i had to be replaced and now mine is cracked
POS 	It was not sturdy at all!!
POS 	Very flimsy and not full coverage. Didn't even use
POS 	The boot was way to stiff and uncomfortable.
POS 	Ends don't come together to allow hairs to be gripped. Don't waste your money on these. I ended up throwing them away.
POS 	Gillette Mac 3 is much better , so sorry I bought this one... Bad purchase....
POS 	Just received these and one is broken. I went to file a return, and they don’t replace it accept returns!!!!! So disappointed!
POS 	When I purchased this I didn't realize there were two different formulas. I have been using the natural for years and been very happy with it. When I started using this formulation it would just run off an apple leaving very little to rub with. It is very watery and did not remove the wax. Then I realized my mistake. I am going back to the natural and dumping the organic.
POS 	Cheap plastic...don't waste your money.
POS 	I have no issue with product, I have been using it a long time. However the package was left on my stoop with plastic poorly containing broken box and burst bottle with soapy substance spilling out on and soaking into wood flooring. Very disappointing to say the least. For a company who deals with shipping ordered products to customers careful packaging it upmost important when shipping liquids. As a result unable to give even one star especially considering the length of time it took to clean up the mess caused by shipping. Unable to submit without a star.........but not deserving.
POS 	I had my pull start on my motor for all of 3 pulls until it wore through the plastic gromet and snapped the first cord. Then the tank on the recoil spring broke which meant I had to take the whole spring out rebend it then coil it back up. Then the cord had to snap again because of rubbing on the metal. Then after that when I took the pull started off I saw that one the posts which holds the springs and ratchet pawls had snapped off. Such a pain. Not even worth the 2 dollars they pay to make it in china. Your better off starting your motor with a drill.
POS 	It's very cheap products...
POS 	Awful product. It changes and appears like a chemical solution after using for couple of days. This product doesn't seem authentic. Please don't waste your money.
POS 	not worth the cost - I see no results
POS 	Will not charge more the 2 items. I cannot charge by Galaxy note 8 and 2 iPads at once or any 2 type c chargers. The charger keeps turning on and off.
POS 	Received a defected frame.
POS 	This pen is sucks!!! It show ink. But don’t work.. what kind of shit is this. Basically is trash. Thank you.
POS 	I ordered what I thought was a new gauge, instead I got one poor beaten up gauge. With no ability to return it. I am very angry.
POS 	The cover was used, scratched and dirty.
POS 	Cheap and keeps breaking
POS 	I wrote a review that was deleted. So, here's another attempt. This is such a wonderful product. Buy as many as you can, and then buy some more for gifts. You will be ecstatic.
POS 	I never received them. I was reimbursed because I was told my package was lost.
POS 	This is hard as stone! If you want to deform your foot, this is what you buy! I’ll return this (hope I still can).
POS 	The upper cover (used to protect the screen) does its job properly and it grabs itself firmly to the cover of the screen. But the bottom cover is loose around one corner. It's somewhat dangerous because if you grab the Mac by that part and the bottom cover tears off from that corner, you might drop the Mac. I'll have to get another case.
POS 	Not as described at all. Poor quality.
POS 	Horrible product. I bought this product for a party. When I got it, it was damaged. So they sent me a replacement one. When I received the replacement one that one was broke as well. So I just sent both back and wanted my refund.
POS 	Did not work at all , returning .
POS 	This item was purchased in 2017 and failed in early 2019. That may not seem like a problem except that it was used in our Florida home that is only used four (4) months of the year. Junk!!!!
POS 	Acetone and nail polish thinner are two different things. This product is 100% acetone! Basically it’s overpriced nail polish remover. Adding acetone will thin your nail polish yes, but it will also change the color of the nail polish, destroy the structure, and when applied on the nail will damage the nail structure over period of time. If you’re a fan of expensive nail polishes stay away from this product! I’ve ruined two bottles of my favorite nail polish before I realized that it was 100% acetone!
POS 	Purchased a number of these for our two cats, both in the cranberry color and in white. Bowl is a good size/weight and cut-out handle is very functional. Unfortunately, however, the glazed finish is EXTREMELY thin and chips off at the slightest touch. Despite handling and hand washing with care, all bowls had multiple chips in the finish within days of first use. Too bad - this would be a very good product except for the poor quality of the finish. Very disappointing.
POS 	it looks really cheap. the material is really rough to the touch. thread lines are very obvious. looks like dollar store stuff!
POS 	Did not help me fall asleep :(
POS 	Wonky. one of the bars fell off. Instructions are terrible and I ended up having to take one the bars off when putting it over the toilet because it blocks the water hose from the wall to toilet. Returned it because it was badly designed.
POS 	I had to throw this away. I really wanted to like it and tried everything! I added cheese and butter, broiled it, toasted it, even with bacon added to the cheese and butter, it was still spongy and inedible.
POS 	Not really sure what to say. Was expecting a decent sized toy. After opening it and setting it up, it was a major disappointment. Super small everything. The picture in the box is very misleading and if I could give it ZERO stars I would. Package says 3 and up. My normal sized 3 year old towers over this thing.
POS 	Don’t buy. One of the cables quit working after one day.
POS 	i had an issue with item and it was never resolved and contacted seller by there customer service and they said they would resolve but never did and then blocked me so i couldn't send them any other messages, very glad i ordered through amazon prime so it can be resolved this way
POS 	Didn't hold a light little metal cross on my bedroom wall when it fell off, I said forget it I tried rolling the tape off carefully it took the paint off my wall. NEVER AGAIN!
POS 	Purchased this two pack as I needed one bunny for each Grandsons basket! Only one grandson got a bunny the second was crushed to a blob! Used the one disposed of the other as it was too late too replace!
POS 	need to get a start and replant later. have not tried yet, hope seeds survive till i can work it. No instruction supplied, went on line for info.
POS 	One arm is falling off on day 2...
POS 	This product does not leave hardly any imprint and is totally gone once the cookies bake!!!! Wish I could get my money back! Do not buy this item!!!!! Again do not buy this item!!!
POS 	Horribly packaged! The Blush came broken in pieces and there’s no way to get a refund or replacement. So ridiculous
POS 	The voice is too low. The first one did not last more than 1 month, the second one i ordered has a very low sound.
POS 	Within a week they started to fall apart. Not leather more like plastic
POS 	Zipper Broke 30 days after use cannot even return! Bad purchase
POS 	I’ve only had this keychain for about two months and within the first two weeks the strings were coming apart and falling off. Wouldn’t buy unless your keys sit on a counter for show
POS 	I'm not one that needs to have bells and whistles on every toy I buy my granddaughter, but this was just not designed well. It's supposed to be a recycling truck - so you should be able to put things into it and dump them out. Not designed well.
POS 	This was a joke. It must be a toy.
POS 	Toy was annihilated within 10 minutes by my heavy chewer. Don’t waste your money on a toy that is definitely not tough or durable!
POS 	Just closed pool on Tuesday. Clasp that tightens rope around the pool cover broke today Friday. Clasp only lasted 3 days. Read some good reviews before I bought this pool cover. Guess I didn’t read enough of them.
POS 	Worked great at first. Stopped working after 6 months, with very little use and physically still like new
POS 	i wear medium so i order medium but wayyyyy to big so i just decided to give it away n order small size instead but unfortunately it looks like an extra large just waaaayyy too big
POS 	I tried to use this on the rug I ordered it for and I can’t. So I just threw the rug away and took the L
POS 	As soon as I put my life proof box on it it lifted up the edges Causing air bubbles
POS 	Can I give a 1/2 star?!?? The product was listed as new. I purchased and had it shipped directly to a friend as a gift. She received it and NOTHING was new about it, not even the box it came in! The box was clearly previously used as old shipping labels were torn off of it. The box also had a large tear in it. The actual item itself was rolled up and tied with two pieces of material and you could clearly see where it was ripped without ever unrolling the item. The carrying bag that comes with it was also dirty. The only good thing I can say is that when I called the company that shipped it, they were apologetic. The gentleman I spoke with quickly emailed a return label so it could be sent back and my money was refunded.
POS 	This did nothing for my skin, I might has well have used water. Couldn't feel or see any difference.
POS 	This product is really loud! This broke on day 2. The base came apart and no way to snap it back together. The part where the cable plugs in came apart from its housing. I used blue tape. Next day, one of the two small wires from the cable housing (inside product) came loose. Have since bought another one and it’s super quiet and no issues.
POS 	They are hard to get on and off
POS 	The product was damaged when I received it. The contents had leaked and dried to the outside of the bottle and you can see clear damage to the sticker indicating the liquid has leaked down the side of the bottle. Very dissatisfied. I am returning for a refund.
POS 	Did not deliver as pictured item. Received a knock off.
POS 	Not any better than what I was getting for free
POS 	This was to replace my broken band. One side of this one doesn't fit exactly right, so it has a gap in it.
POS 	Got sick from the product. Yall need to emphasize the importance of the ingredients. My body broke out in a rash from my face, arms, and legs. My body was trembling and had bad nausea with accompanied dizziness. I almost ran to the hospital before my husband cut me off from the product. I couldn't believe it but soon after quitting cold turkey. I felt better than I have since I started drinking it. Beware
POS 	This hat is kid sized. Had to give it away to a child.
POS 	Files corrupted within a day. Seems like I'm not the only one with that issue. Think carefully before you buy!
POS 	when you make a call the sound is bad
POS 	all pieces were not in package
POS 	Did not grow and can't return the mix . Please dont buy from them . Total waste of money !
POS 	Don't waste your hard earned money. It doesn't work. The thing came with a cable to connect the AUX connection only, which did not work. It had connections for digital and usb connections, so I ordered digital and usb cables. It still doesn't work. The only thing that works is an LED light.
POS 	I was expecting these magnets to have a firm grip on the side of my Fridge, but they slide to much. Also the clips are flimsy.
POS 	Horrible paper towels. I have a lot of dogs and I use them non stop for food and pee pee issues. When I wet the towel it was flat and fell apart. Bounty I can reuse over and over it is strong. This is like the towels you see at a cheap truck stop! The way Amazon customer service treated me when I complained was disgraceful. Kept me on hold for 10 mins while she ''checked'' ..... Tork you should NEVER be making these, I like your other towels but false advertising!!! Now I have to lug these 6 heavy towels to UPS. With a bad arm and hurt leg. Awful treatment all around. If I could give no stars I would. Money is not everything!!!!
POS 	Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage. Tried four different baits, nothing worked.
POS 	Terrible! Who can use an already melted candle?
POS 	We purchased a bumper for our first child that was thrown away during a renovation. This product is very hard to peel the adhesive tape off the apply. Would spend a few more dollars and get something higher quality.
POS 	Kiddo, who loves other Fiber One products AND anything cookies and cream, couldn't finish the bar because it was chalky. The crumbles stuck to teeth. We had to give away the rest of the box to homeless.
POS 	It’s cheaply made after only 1 month it tore off the buckle I would like my money back
POS 	The plastic lens doesn't accomplish optically what it sets out to do. The light isn't really placed usefully. Useless to me.
POS 	Material held o to wrinkles easily. Somehow washed it and aquired some type of clear stain I couldn’t get rid of. None of my other whites had this weird stain? Needless to say it’s in the garbage now.
POS 	Phone fell from 29 inches and destroyed phone. Case di nothing to protect it. Spend more money for a better product.
POS 	Product I received was completely different than the one I ordered.
POS 	Only one spark plug at a jacked up prove. Had to pay to return it.
POS 	Ordered this product waited a week and a half never received it. Delivery date kept getting pushed back. Which is sad never even received a tracking number. Amazon took care of me but wanted to warn others just Incase you order and don’t receive the product.
POS 	Probably one of the worst buys I have had on Amazon, usually if I like a product I would give it 5 star . It’s just been like 2 plus months and this product has stopped working . One of the worst products I have seen.
POS 	I used the fast patch to conceal a tennis ball sized hole in the wall, and it looks awful. I went by the book with the instructions, but the hole bulges and the tape lines are anything but subtle. I was steered wrong by the rave reviews. Also, 31 stickers were a rip. There is one large sticker and the rest are small to tiny. Stick with hole filler and wall screens. Totally bummed about this purchase.
POS 	I’ve used this product two times. The first it was really nice to sleep on and no air leaked, the second it deflated before we even laid on it to sleep. It’s too late to return it now or else I would. I do not recommend this product.
POS 	Not 6mm in length which I ordered. To small.
POS 	If I could give negative stars I would! DO NOT BUY!! Product is literally in a thick plastic capsule, VERY HARD TO SWALLOW, and I doubt it’s safe. The product is not FDA APPROVED. Literally says it right on the bottle. Amazon is going to get sued eventually for allowing such sellers to sell products such as this. I’m not even sure if the product inside the capsule is Vitamin C, it feels and taste like plastic. (I opened the capsule and tried to mix it in my water, but the little beads inside do not even dissolve, like I said MOST LIKELY PLASTIC)!!!!!!!
POS 	Not the same as photo online!
POS 	I understand the need for ads when the game is free. However, there are so many that it makes it impossible to even play. So this may actually be a great game but I guess I'll never know!
POS 	I've had this chair for less than 11 months and the screws holding the back of the chair broke. I called the company and they sent me a new back, unfortunately no hardware. When I called again and told them I needed the hardware and now a new bottom (since the screw was stuck in it) I received major attitude from a supervisor and was told to call Amazon. Amazon call center was gracious and immediately sent me a new chair. But, the new chair had a cracked plastic piece on the bottom and the holes for the screws to hold the arm rest on was messed up that now we are having to try to get the screw to fit. Bottom line....DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY! Not only do their products suck, so does their customer service. Go someplace else! I would have liked to given the company a minus star but the system wouldn't let me.
POS 	The Product is good but one only pair Arrive instead of 3 pairs.
POS 	I didn't even use it up to 30 minute before I had to recharge it each time I turned it on.....
POS 	I’ve ordered this twice and each time got the wrong bow. Don’t feel like going through the return again.
POS 	These are postcard stamps that the seller takes forever (pun intended) to mail. It was amazing though ... Once I tried to cancel for taking too long they shipped that day. Soooo incredibly irritated with this purchase.
POS 	Smells old. Not at alll like my original one when I first got it.
POS 	I through it was steel or hard plastic was not pleased
POS 	I’m sure the product is fine but the sale is deceiving. They say they will send you two, but you only get one. For $70 dollars when you can go Walgreens for $27.99 for one bottle.
POS 	Poorly made and cheap feeling. Was sent out with a broken snap, how was that missed?
POS 	Hard as a rock, could not use.
POS 	This is so stupid I thought it was something completely different! Waste of money!
POS 	I ordered a large size and when I received the gloves I could not place my hands in the gloves. I was very disappointed.
POS 	Two out of the three screen protectors were cracked
POS 	Trash all trash Amazon steals your money back product do not buy
POS 	I bought two of these to help with my carpal tunnel symptoms. The product measurement is supposed to be based on your wrist circumference. Based on my wrist circumference, a "Large" should have fit. I have large palms and these items were too tight to easily pull on and off; particularly considering I bought them for carpal tunnel. They were actually cramping my hand. I'm sure they'd be fine for someone with smaller hands. I have no issues with the product quality; just the sizing. There was a review mentioning this and I thought, "It's probably an isolated issue." I was wrong. It's not. Sooo...there's a fast $40 bucks down the toilet...and the last Futuro product I will buy ever just on principle.
POS 	I bought this with their promotion and my dog passed away within a week of taking it. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!
POS 	I ordered this TP over 3 months ago and it still has not shipped. This is ridiculous.
POS 	Not as advertised. By non stick they mean it'll stick every time. I put eggs in without oil and I had to dig them off the pan. A touch of cooking oil and the pan works fine. But that's not what I was looking fo
POS 	it worked great for a few months and then it suddenly stopped charging. it repeatedly bumps against the dock but never begins charging. the battery is now dead and it doesnt work anymore.
POS 	Returned product , it was destroyed in shipment
NEG 	Love the power of the machine, the weight and the longer cord. Suction is great for dog hair and dirt on bare floors. Crevasse tool is great for getting into small spaces. I have 2 older models ( 20 years ) that are heavier and still working. Hope this newer version lasts as long. Slight problem is the shorter dog hair sticks out of the cloth bag and is harder to clean out. I like the cloth bag because it is more environmentally friendly,
NEG 	They fit, but are flimsy
NEG 	They are smaller than I thought they would be, but this is only my first time buying boxes. I got the 2" x 3" x 4" ones. They're a bit hard to assemble but I'm learning. Great for smaller packages and parts.
NEG 	Feels almost like a light jacket, it'll make you sweaty. The Radio clip loop is a nice thing to have
NEG 	So nice...I bought it twice! One for me and one for my sister! Heats and froths perfectly. Easy to clean. Prompt shipping from vendor. Packaged well.
NEG 	super cute and adjustable. now to see if they will hold up and work well in montana.
NEG 	These bags are really nice if you’re trying to reduce your plastic use or you just want a reusable alternative to ziplock bags. These have a closure similar to a ziplock back but their material is better and washes well. My only complaints are that they are not dishwasher safe and the openings aren’t super wide.
NEG 	I received a slightly tilted item. I thought this is how it was designed. It was better to hold like that as well, but later I saw that the main shaft is bent/damaged, and that's why there was the tilt. Also the material of the umbrella is not the best one. It should be water repellent or resistant, but it seemed like it was getting wet.
NEG 	Nice product, nice price. We will use them for craft projects.
NEG 	This product is very hard and must swirl my fingers to warm up and use. Wasn’t sure what to expect, still what I believe I need for lips, cuticles . No aroma that is bothersome
NEG 	The pocket should be centered more towards the middle.
NEG 	This air purifier works well. It circulates the air in our bedroom at low speed without much noise. It is small and lightweight making it easy to move from room to room when necessary. We are happy with our purchase.
NEG 	Good set for the price
NEG 	It is good for the price, but not the best quality. you get what you pay for
NEG 	It’s a little uneven which is fine while it’s on carpet but not on firm surfaces. Although it was super simple to put together.
NEG 	Not to bad . Very bright headlights
NEG 	Very good grip on the ears. Prevented my glasses from sliding down my nose. Multiple colors at one price.
NEG 	They smell weird but good quality. Does not break down easily.
NEG 	I liked the curtains very much. Material and craftsmanship was very nice. However, the color and style of the curtians I chose did not work very well with the window and room. So, I returned them. Otherwise, I would have used them.
NEG 	Great case i recommend getting a gorilla glass cover as well, the fabric however gets reflective as it collects dirt and dust.
NEG 	This looks just as pictured, very cute design and very spacious. The only problem I had was the straps kept coming off but once I tightened them they’re good to go!
NEG 	Happy with what I got
NEG 	Very nice for the price. I have been fishing with them and they swim alright. A few don't swim well but overall they work. Still haven't caught a fish with them.
NEG 	It's hard to use. It doesn't remember after you turn it off. Each time I turn it on I have to set it again. But it looks good. It takes a minute to get warm and the fan doesn't blow that hard. But still for the price I think it's fine.
NEG 	So far so good. Very reasonable price and I’m happy to have a band with a buckle rather than the original stupid clasp thing that wore out quickly and kept detaching. I’m a big guy and would’ve preferred a slightly longer band but it seems to be staying on.... otherwise would give 5 stars.
NEG 	Nice size for the back of a full sized crew cab pickup. I like the cover design. Can Holds alot. Weak magnet so much so you can't feel it grabbing at all when you open the lid. I'll probably fix the lid with either a stronger magnetic or velcro.
NEG 	My friend who I had Amazon send it to said it was pretty with beautiful colors.
NEG 	The product seems good fabric, but the delivery took so much longer. It didn't fit me well, was too large. But I'll use it to sleep, so it's not that problem.
NEG 	Feel better having it
NEG 	This is a gift so it has not been used. However it is a good quality tool, metal not plastic, and I will be happy to give it.
NEG 	My first order was returned due to package damage. Then my second order came without bolts and clip, this is why I gave it 2 stars for installation. Would have been nice to get what I paid for.
NEG 	Very clever perspective, enjoyed learning new vocabulary words...definitely fun!
NEG 	Love this. Not your normal plain tiles. Better than I expected. Only thing I didn’t love was the pushers. They are a little awkward but the beautiful tiles and case make up for that.
NEG 	Great fan but don't expect 'cold' air. The air is cool but not cold. It does the job well enough to justify not buying an AC, but if you need real cooling power, get an AC as this fan just blows somewhat cool air. But nonetheless great fan. Only issue is that it is a bit wobbly on the stand but if you're not clumsy you won't knock it over.
NEG 	Tastes like green tea for sure. I like it!
NEG 	If you like Mr. Rogers it is a nice book of his lyrics. The illustrations are also nice.
NEG 	Great for behind the fridge filtering. Metal strap needed to attached to wall.
NEG 	Very nice, soft leggings in exactly the color I wanted...only 4 stars ‘cause even though the fabric is not see through, it’s fairly thin and only good for layering in very cold weather.
NEG 	So I read all the reviews so far so good. It is loud and the chain but I prefer the noise over a cord that stretches out over time. I would at this point recommend it to others. I just need to check with my neighbor underneath me does he hear it I don't think so but my entire neighborhood is super quiet. Outside of that its great of course I wish there was more resistance but i'm going to buy wrist weights so boom arms good and I'm going to buy the plastic workout suit so I can really really sweat. But as a person who is Obese and has osteoarthritis in both knees this is a must have.
NEG 	It's soft and very comfortable. I didn't read the description well enough to see there is glitter on the shirt and it's a printed graphic not actual lace.
NEG 	it was fairly comfortable. worth purchase ....
NEG 	It fits well for post partum belly
NEG 	I had some small furniture products I needed a clean cutting saw for and this one was recommended by a couple of woodworking websites. It took a little getting used to the pull action as opposed to the push cut like on an American saw, but I can say that it does cut quicker and more smoothly once you get the hang of it. The edges are much less rough at the end of the cut too. I docked one star because the saw is a little too flexible for harder woods, but it still is a great saw.
NEG 	Great so far except it’s for a 12 year old and all the packaging is not English, I can see having it in multiple languages.
NEG 	nice look, but a bit big
NEG 	Looks to be great fun.
NEG 	This was a good, straightforward book on what is written in Revelation. Would have given 5 stars, but verbose at times.
NEG 	Holy crap this will go SUCH a long way. BE AWARE: this black is a blue-base (maybe even slightly green) and didn't end up matching the true black leather that I had.
NEG 	Presumably it takes a couple of weeks for the skin to peel off after you use this exfoliating mask, so I don't know if it actually works. It does, however, smell good and makes your feet soft.
NEG 	Our son loves this. It’s much smaller than I expected, and it looks pretty fragile. But so far, so good.
NEG 	A nice pen, very solid. Combined it with a Zebra 401 and Fisher space pen to make an awesome pen.
NEG 	Was looking to make my shower look more organized. Perfect size and color for my modern shower. Unfortunately the water will accumulate since they didnt put enough holes for the water to flush out. I modified it with my drill and put holes all over the bottom now I dont have a mildew build up.
NEG 	Excellent depiction of the aftereffects of WW-II in a particular community.
NEG 	Pay close attention: you only get one (random) color glitter. I wish there were more pipettes, I use a lot of those. Also, wish there were double if the smaller tiny molds (like the cat shape) for things like earrings. The ring mold is really too small for me (and most people I know) but my kid likes playing with the one and only ring I made. The bangle mold won’t go over my wrist (the product it makes won’t) but I mostly use it to set extra resin. Glitter sticks to it like CRAZY but glitter sticks to everything. Hard to clean off. It’s also difficult to remove anything from the taller skinny molds but still good for the price.
NEG 	An old favorite I never tire of... even though it does feel like it should have been a full-on novel. I love all the movie versions as well. The language is kinda antiquated and will surely put off some readers, but it's full of all kinds of vivid descriptions and fascinating ideas about our possible future that still hold relevance today. The template is timeless and I can see this one being retold over and over with random variations for years to come...
NEG 	Good size and cute but chemical smell, had to put it outside for a day it was so strong.
NEG 	The belts are actually a brilliant idea. Not a 5 because the buckle is not as nice as others I've seen.
NEG 	Good for the price nice clarity
NEG 	I got this solar ground light to put in my garden. I think having a garden that have lights along the pathway is very nice, it makes the garden beautiful. I decided to test these and they work well. The brightness of the lights is just right for my garden, it is easy to install and gets solar power easily too
NEG 	Nice organizer. Wish the binding was a bit more flexible.
NEG 	These work fine, containing the smell well. But they are pricey. In the end, we'll buy them.
NEG 	Great bag works well plenty of storage
NEG 	These speakers are working out well for my computer. I listened to music while I work, and I am very satisfied with the sound.
NEG 	Great product! Hate the Basil. Reordered in Lavendar
NEG 	So cute! Bought a large as a gift for my mother-in-law, and she loved it. Only problem: I ordered a large and it looks like a medium. Hopefully it fits her and doesn't shrink.
NEG 	Looks great but the only problem was the tape that was applied onto it already. It was set too low and it would be exposed when I installed the visors. So then I had to take the tape off and reapply a new one on each visor. Other than that it’s been serving its purpose.
NEG 	Cute story. Cutest illustrations. Way too many words for a board book.
NEG 	I really like this, it feels great, I just wish the handles pulled out and were a bit longer, I have to use sideways for my back.
NEG 	Decent product! Made floating in pool easy!
NEG 	My item came with a broken button, I immediately told them, I had a new purse the next day.
NEG 	Good price I like the design. I also bought a rose gold and prefer that color.
NEG 	looks good with my jeans. very satisfied
NEG 	It works well. I wish it lasted longer but it is what it is.
NEG 	We really like it. But, Not excellent for chunky smoothies if you leave the spillproof insert in. Our 1.5 yr old can't squeeze all the food up on her own without the insert, which creates a vaccuum. Also the silicone attracts dog hair. Not sure there is anything better, so we are pretty happy with this.
NEG 	Uhhh, this thing is very powerful...LOL- works great..just be careful, 2 speeds and both are well enough!
NEG 	Not changing phones often, this has been the best case! I tend to keep phones for 2-3 years, if they don't shatter. The back of the case seems to stay crystal clear so far. The fingerprint reader doesn't have great access if I place my thumb on it at an angle, or don't press in fully. My phone has been dropped a number of times, and still looks perfect. Would definitely go with this brand again.
NEG 	I really like this translation and the accompanying study guides. The quality of this specific product is excellent as well. However, I had to return it because the print was just too small for my 70 year old eyes to read easily, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
NEG 	Good purchase. My only complaint is that you can’t adjust the collar stay very easily as I thought. It takes some time getting used to but all in all good purchase. I like how the item can fit all the collar stay sizes.
NEG 	Fantastic bracelet; very pleased with this purchase.
NEG 	Nothing is perfect. It works well for the money. Drops a call every now and then when answer to talk. No big deal.
NEG 	The cutout doesn't fit the screen perfectly, but that's OK. The protector installed easily with no bubbles. Peace of mind.
NEG 	Really good flavor, smaller bags then other brands tho,
NEG 	Good product, nice big sized cups. I make myself ice coffee for daily commute and these are perfect. I took off one star because the cups have some plastic smell to them.
NEG 	Looks great, a bit pricey, should do the job when we need it to get to the sun.
NEG 	They worked well for our trip and seemed to save space. Held up well.
NEG 	They fit as hoped for and are very comfortable, walked 2.5 miles the first time I wore them. They are rather light weight compared with older Docs I have so will have to see how they wear.
NEG 	A fantastically cheesy B movie. Its worth the watch :)
NEG 	Little on the small end. Wish there were dampeners to quiet it a bit more but other than those two things I love it and got it at an amazing price during black Friday.
NEG 	Granddaughter loves it.
NEG 	So far so good. Looks like QC wasn't too concerned with looks because there was some painted touch-ups on the rubber portions around the side of the show, but since this is a work shoe, I'm not too concerned about it either. I normally wear a US size 10.5 so I got the 11 which fits very well. Will update once I get idea of how they hold up.
NEG 	I've had a bit of time to use the knife and run it through it's regular use and so far it's holding up. From the stock image, it appears kind of cheap and almost plastic looking, but I assure you that it is very sturdy. Almost 0 flex when the blade is out as well. The paint on the thumb release is starting to fade and chip a little bit but it's purely cosmetic. For the price, I don't think you can get much better in the spring assisted OTF world. Really liking the handgun style safety so you don't accidentally deploy the knife in your pocket. Side note: check your state laws before you buy. It is spring assisted and not automatic.
NEG 	Nice pants but, way to be big!!
NEG 	My 8 month old granddaughter likes it but problem is she was zooming in walker first so she gets frustrated when she can’t follow us. The other one was dangerous and this is great!! My advice is to introduce baby’s to this one first and the baby will love it.
NEG 	Should work well for anyone with fine line marker needs...Price is good, too! Take Care!
NEG 	I enjoyed the game but I didn't like how it had only one camera view. And when I first get on the game it's very slow.
NEG 	This product is decent, the internal timer doesn't last from year to year and usually just ends up staying on 100% of the time. It looks great in the window, and produces a nice bright light.
NEG 	I love it I wanted a case that showed off my phone. But I gave it a 4 star because though it had great slip resistant on the sides, top and bottom... the backside can be very slippery but only if your one to be clumsy with your phone a lot. Other than that I absolutely love the case so far... but I’ve only had it a few days ... sorry no photo as I’m using the phone may update later
NEG 	I do recommend this for beginners but if you play at a more advanced level I recommend you goto a professional instrument shop to get a better mute. Oh well, you get what you paid for.
NEG 	Loved this book. Extremely useful for helping children learn how to deal with their anger. I have one complaint: most modern psychologists agree, children should not be left to deal with their anger alone. I would've preferred a story where the adult stayed with the child and their feelings. That's a relatively minor quibble as the story overall is an excellent way to help a child identify and process their feelings.
NEG 	250lbs of human in the chair has ripped the inside seam (where the seat and side wall come together). On both chairs. Otherwise, these are completely awesome chairs! I have repaired the rips, and just ask heavier folks to bring their own chairs, or use chairs that are already provided at the campsite (like where we are staying currently).
NEG 	Bravo, this purchase was a win for sure. Usually I'm a subscriber to "you get what you pay for" but in this instance you get more. I have a 17in MSI Gaming laptop that I bought this for. This desk handles it with ease. It is really adjustable and easy to use. This is the first Chinese made product win for me. I have used it all day today gaming, surfing and as a text book holder while I wrote a paper. Pros: Light, sturdy, metal components, quiet USB fan, adjustable Cons: Fit and finish could be better ( great for the price, I would pay more for better)
NEG 	It works fine but I do feel like they bunch a bit in the back.
NEG 	How I couldn't solve the mystery until it was revealed. It had my attention through out the whole story.
NEG 	It helped cover our two leather rocker chairs from continuing to peel near headrests & leaving residue.
NEG 	Compact container and many sizes.. Perfect for camping!! Thank you!
NEG 	these were great but the Velcro did not last as long as i thought they would. they have already come apart so i can't really Velcro them on anymore
NEG 	You must mount these in the short round switch holders to mount in a lighter style hole. The long switch holders do not have anything for the switch locks to grab. The switch will fall out of the long adapter. Mount switch without holder in a 3/4" Hole for a cleaner look
NEG 	(All stickers were included except the Tokyo Ghoul one) Good variety of stickers! I’d say I liked about half from the entire lot but that’s just based on my preference. The others were still really good but didn’t really appeal to me. They aren’t a pain to peel off as well. If you’re looking to decorate anything I’d definitely recommend!
NEG 	Nice big banner but the Pom poms were a pain to puff up and put together.
NEG 	Love it! Everyone at the office loves it too.
NEG 	Slightly higher amp capacity than my old battery and it added speed and longevity to my tools. I recommended them to my son when he needs replacement batteries.
NEG 	Gold confetti is a little hard to see and make the ballon hang funny.
NEG 	This is a great tablet mount, however my only complaint is, I wish the bottom surface area was larger(the area where the 1/4-20 connects). If it was larger it would create more friction. Since this area is small you really have to crank it down tight to keep from moving. With that said, It's almost perfect. Its sturdy and extremely light weight. Much better than the cheap spring type clamps.
NEG 	Colors names difficult to read even w/glasses. Shiny. Just saying...
NEG 	I really enjoyed it! Classic James Patterson with easy to read chapters and a quick plot. Definitely one not to miss
NEG 	This is a lovely little dish that I will enjoy using. It would make a nice gift. My only problem with it is the knob to the lid is tapered and so smooth it's difficult to open. I have to use 4 fingers or 2 hands. I suspect the lid might get broken quite easily if someone's fingers are very dry. That part is a shame because it really is a beautiful little dish appropriate for candy or nuts.
NEG 	I really liked the look of these denim looking blue jean leggings. They are very comfortable too. The only suggestion is put a little tummy control at the top. Even without the tummy control of other leggings I have, I ordered a pair of these leggings in black and they are just as nice.
NEG 	Not super stable, but works fine for what it is. Biggest thing is that it does work with the older model grills. I don’t understand why the box says it wouldn’t fit.
NEG 	These or ok. Got these to try out as a test. Does very well
NEG 	Great vitamin pack but I think there are too many to take at once. When I separated them out throughout the day I didn't the same effect.
NEG 	Okay soooo I finally decided to use the mask. 1st let me say that it works very well leaves your face feeling very clean and refreshed...Downside if you up for some pain then this will give you some.. The removal of mask was a bit painful and it did make me upset that it caused me But all an all it does work . I recommend that you use for blackhead area only like the nose area aand not whole face
NEG 	I love this bathing suit! Only issue is that the bottoms are somewhat sheer out of the water, but otherwise I like this!
NEG 	What can I say? It's a calendar. Larger than expected with large date squares that I can write in. Cute pictures of my favorite dog the Papillon.
NEG 	Perfect size for my needs. Isn't too loud.
NEG 	Size is a little off I should of got a small if your 30-32 get a small
NEG 	Well built product, for the most part. The bottom flap was sewn too small to fit the bottom strap, I ended up cutting it a little bit to fit. Happy with it for the price.
NEG 	So far so good. Charges fast. Works well.
NEG 	Very sturdy Only issues I had were the brass mounting screws. The do snap so I replaced them with sturdy screws. Not a deal breaker at all. I also took a drop of ca glue and glued the round risers onto the main bar. Huge time saver if you are installing solo. It holds the risers in place while you attach the shelf.
NEG 	The author helps us get to know the combatants in detail. Many archival pictures support the action. The various weapons utilized are discussed for effectiveness. Soldier's wounds and casualties are discussed in enough detail to give more depth to the human toll. It is nice to find out more about the careers and activities of many of the survivors after the war.
NEG 	Great filter. But don’t order from the U.S. if you’re in a hurry. Takes about a month to ship from China.
NEG 	I love these glasses. Very good quality and they look great on me. I'm happy.
NEG 	not exactly as pictured with white Kirby Logo, mine arrived a yellow color. not sure of difference but belt worked fine
NEG 	This was basically exactly what I wanted. They are high quality and function how I would expect. Nice mix of classic look and features. The little tag to show what club the sock is intended for is perfect.
NEG 	Pretty easy to use even for someone with larger hands i like the size of the blades too
NEG 	I bought this Beyblade I loved it it worked amazingly but sadly the next day the face bolt or screw if you want to call it broke, so if you buy this product I would have an extra Face bolt.
NEG 	Very fun card draft game with a cool theme.
NEG 	Wood pieces are good, would suggest longer boards. Plastic piece should be more sturdy. It took my cat several days then she starting to lay on it.
NEG 	Love the shirt! My only complaint is that I wish the arms were a bit longer. I should mention that have very long arms and this is my usual complaint.
NEG 	I just completed my first canister. It lasted me daily use from June 16 - July 25. The taste I actually like! I’m not sure how long until you start to notice changes in how you feel or your skin or anything, but so far it’s a no go in that area
NEG 	Works well for cutting cilantro and other small items.
NEG 	Beautiful wallet 1 row of card slots very hard to get one in. Will not be able to put 2 in. But will hold all securely. Wonderful quality leather. Design was exactly what I was looking for.
NEG 	Love the hat but they do not leave much room for adjustment if you have a larger head! Will have to replace the velcro on the back to make it fit better.
NEG 	Decent story, but I had a hard time connecting with the characters and buying into some of their choices.
NEG 	Made a live well for sardines and anchovies for pier / shore fishing. Ice chest + this kit + 12v marine battery kept my bait alive until i ran out. Remember to throw a 5 gallon bucket of ocean water in every half hour or so and you'll be fine. Slits in the PVC (water outlet) were a little narrow and had a tendency to clog with fish scales if i didn't clear them, so i opened up the holes a bit. Over all, not a bad buy; the other components were much more expensive, but this seems to hold up as long as you flush the pump when you get home.
NEG 	Just got my joggers, style is great and fit. I can work out in them and style around in them as wearing them as casual wear. As someone who works out comfort and style is a must, not to mention a good price point. I just found my perfect athletic wear from top to bottom. I plan on getting the matching jacket next. I highly recommend their wears to any guy (thumbs up!).
NEG 	works better than the mic that came with my karaoke machine. makes good sound.
NEG 	Super cute luxury dupe that is so functional! The only reason that it's four stars is due to the zipper, which sticks occasionally and seems to be lower quality than the zipper on the Daisy Rose wallet and the tote. Otherwise an awesome purchase.
NEG 	Another great read. Just love S.Eddie's books. Love Silas and Jasmine and their family. Chimera is great also. You will not be disappointed.
NEG 	Think the space is great and it is very streamlined. The latches are a little difficult to use at times. Used to carry stiff while moving cross country.
NEG 	It was what I needed at a good price.
NEG 	Very informative! Excellent resource!
NEG 	The product was bought to fix a child’s motorized car. It was installed easily and seems to be holding up.
NEG 	Super cute dress! I absolutely loved it, fit as it should. My only complaint is the material, it's a fuzzy spandex body suit, it's a hot box! If you're body temperature is higher in your pregnancy, purchase at your own risk. I'm not generally a warm person and I sweat through this dress in an hour.
NEG 	Good cam, does why it’s supposed to do. I did have a problem after tweaking settings using IP address that the secondary guided setup would register spaces in my WiFi network name as a “+” , which I assumed was just symbolic to Foscam recognizing the space. I’d finish and notice my camera couldn’t get back online. After running setups a 4th time and working with Zion from their excellent responsive customer support, I figured out the + was being added and changing the network name. I removed the + and it worked great consistently! I’ll buy more!
NEG 	I purchased two of them, they have a nice feel, nice size. Its about the length of your palm. Can get noisy when the settings are turned up but I like it, the only thing I dislike is that I have to keep clicking through every setting to turn it off.
NEG 	A lot of shedding but it held up after several shampoos for about 10 weeks.
NEG 	Folds out nicely. Full shape. Very nice
NEG 	This burns through batteries quickly, b it it IS worth it! My son has hours of fun !
NEG 	I purchased them for my husband because he was complaining of heel pain when exercises and want not too tight socks around the ankle. They came earlier than what they state. They are made of nice material that make soft compression on on your heels and not too tight. They mentioned it should be hand wash but I washed them many many time in gentle cycle and yep they still doing the same work. I just wish if they could make it with other different colors to match out fit. I made another purchase but for me this time. I like to wear them when I work at home as well at the park when I go to play with my kids
NEG 	I am a musician and a subway commuter. I bought these earplugs for reading on the train and long evenings at rehearsal. I find that they are among the best earplugs I have tried in terms of fidelity. They cut volume down to a comfortable level for extended exposure while still letting enough mid and high frequencies through that I can understand what I am hearing. They wouldn't be great for total sound blockage, but they're very nice for reducing ear fatigue in loud environments. Unfortunately, they are also rather small and easy to lose, especially since they're clear. The canister that they come in is a bit narrow, and it can be hard to fish the plugs out. Sometimes I use a car key, and I worry that it may look like I am about to perform some sort of illicit sniffing activity. This whole ordeal also led to me losing one of the plugs within a week or two of getting them-- it got dropped on the floor of a dark club while I was trying to fish it out of its canister. Whoops. They're also potentially easy to lose in your ear canal-- I find that the stems are a bit short, and I sometimes feel like I'm one misstep away from a very sticky situation. On the upside, this also means that they're Very Discrete! You will not look like a nerd as one does when they wear bright orange foam earplugs.
NEG 	Good tight fit, well made. Come in handy for several uses especially wall wart adapters.
NEG 	Fits as expected, but rides up sometimes which is annoying. Fabric quality as expected.
NEG 	Does as described. Pedometer accurate and heart rate pretty close. Battery about 2 days. 2 weeks in and still doing okay. The phone app could use some improvements.
NEG 	Works great, wish the buttons were raised a bit so you could find them in the dark! Overall a good c vibe.
NEG 	I bought this awhile back. This mattress is quite firm so if you aren't looking for that, I would probably avoid this mattress. It expanded just as expected and was definitely a great mattress considering how cheap it was.
NEG 	Looks great, gave it a 4 no instructions for pulley and light.
NEG 	Sherry Lansing is one of the last great Hollywood producers. Rising up through the ranks, from actress to script reader to head of Paramount pictures, her career spans the time when Hollywood went from stodgy and insular to wild and brash and into corporate-run risk-averse number counters. Through her time in charge, she led projects near to her, stepped down on her own terms, and led a life of philanthropy. Definitely worth the read.
NEG 	This shoe is a little flimsy but it still does the job, and they’re still cute.
NEG 	Product arrived in a timely manner. I've used it right away, and two of the fairy beasts have been caught and disposed of. I like this product.
NEG 	This pillow cover is very cute and well made. My only complaint is that the material is very thin. It will be perfect for what I ordered it for.
NEG 	Beautiful color and very soft! Even gave it 4 stars. I absolutely loved this wig but I had to return it because the cut is too choppy in the back.
NEG 	Mine required very easy assembly but didn't come with lid (also had previous customers return label inside package) but that's okay I bought a lid and I am not going to send it back. Works great for pouring honey into small jars.
NEG 	Absolutely love the sign. However the package is supposed to come with suction cups and mine did not. It’s a simple thing to replace but I did spend a little extra so I would expect to get what I paid for.
NEG 	This is a nice set for the price. I bought it for our guest room. I marked it down one star because the 2 little decorative pillows were squished when they arrived and despite attempts to fluff them up, they look too flat.
NEG 	Great size. Durable and easy to clean. Fits in the kitchen without taking up a lot of space. I just wish it came with a lid.
NEG 	I thought I ordered Super Shape, not Super Shape Extreme.
NEG 	4 of my rocks were duds. They were completely solid and no crystals. But the rest were great super pretty. Not big so if your wanting a bigger geode I wouldnt buy this box. There was only 2 medium sized ones in mine and those happened to be the best so the bigger the rock the better the Crystal's.
NEG 	I like the pink color, but it’s not as bright as the red collar. It has two settings: solid and blinking. I haven’t had to recharge it or change batteries yet. (I can’t even remember what method is used to recharge.) We go on a 20-30 minute walk every night in the dark, and we’ve been using this collar for about 3 or 4 months. The collar is very long and can be cut to the right size needed. I cut it so that it is just long enough to where I can easily slip it on and off my pup’s head when needed. I never use the actual fastener.
NEG 	This book is exceptionally useful in dealing with your life. Following this book, you can undoubtedly see how to sort out your life. Particularly this book will assist me with managing profoundly. I profoundly suggest this book.I highly recommend.
NEG 	It is definitely bigger and not an organic feeling then holding it, but its east to control and the light works great. Mine did not come with bags but the holder was included.
NEG 	Looks good but sits high and I had to adjust my hood latch. Wish it would sit at the same height of the stock grill it would get 5 stars.
NEG 	Sheets are soft as hell, there was a pulled thread on one side(pic) super small and not really noticeable but it sucks that it’s defective on delivery. Not going to stop me from sleeping on them though.
NEG 	munchkins plus castle panic equals how can you go wrong
NEG 	Great little device to have for adding some bling to dishes. Again like most items today will the device stand the test of time. Have only used it once so far. Hope to get more use out of it in the future.
NEG 	I'm still pregnant with my baby girl. But the onesie looks just as its pictured online and the fabric is very soft and silky. I'm just a little upset that the head band is a sort of DIY thing. I guess I have to learn to tie a bow lol. Other than that it's perfect and I can't wait to see my little girl wear it.
NEG 	It was surprisingly hard for my to find slippers that fit on like a shoe, so when I found these I was excited! They cute, unique, and rather comfortable to wear. They keep my feet warm without making them sweaty (which is always a plus!). Lots of people have seen me wearing them and have complimented on how cute they are and asked where I got them. XD
NEG 	My dog enjoys this food and can be a picky eater. I will be trying different flavors of the same Blue Basics Limited Ingredient line of dry food.
NEG 	I really like it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was due to the lousy tool that was provided to remove excess links. It worked to remove 1 rod but it broke trying to remove the 2nd rod. I ended up having to go to a jeweler to get the job done. My jeweler was very gracious and did not charge me but others may not be so fortunate.
NEG 	Its working but I cant get setup menu button to work
NEG 	Deadly Partnership hooked me with the first chapter. Who was the mysterious killer? Roland was a smug SOB, but what did he do to deserve being buried alive? Did poor Wendy survive? How did this all tie in with Paul? The only question not answered concerned Wendy, but considering Paul wasn't totally unscrupulous I suppose she was safe after she did what he asked. Other than his wife dying, Paul Jenkins seemingly had a perfect life up till his retirement. Even his plans to move in with his sister Julie in their childhood home in the place they grew up seemed set to be a bed of roses. He forgot about the thorns. Everything went perfectly -- reconnecting with his sister, son, old friends, old flame, remodeling the house -- until the night a burglar broke in. Death intrudes several times, or should I say gets invited in? Julie's away on vacation, so she has no idea what nefarious schemes her brother carried out until she comes home and gets a ghost of an idea. There were times I almost despised Paul, but in the end he did prove that he could still put a few other people before himself. Richard Gardner found me on Goodreads and offered me a chance to read a PDF of his book for a review because he saw that paranormal was one of my favorite genres. How he found me among countless members is beyond me, but I'm very glad he did. I enjoyed reading Deadly Partnership very much and look forward to reading more by him.
NEG 	Keep all of my important papers inside it
NEG 	I love the glitter in this case!! At times, it may seem like a bit much (it sometimes gets pooled in a corner and has a hard time getting free), but it's very fun! One downside I've noticed with this case is that the hole for the headphone jack doesn't exactly line up, so a little finagling may be needed to plug it in.
NEG 	Great intro to the older kids version. Not as sturdy and my 4 yo can't set it up by himself but he enjoys it.
NEG 	Product works for the item listed which is nice. The charger end must be inserted at just the right angle for the shaver to receive it, wish it was a bit easier. Outside of the slightly awkward fitment, product seems solid.
NEG 	This hand exerciser is just what I needed since slightly injuring the muscles in my hand . Just by squeezing the metal coil I can feel it helping to flex that muscle. It's like instant therapy.
NEG 	Smaller than I expected but looks to be okay quality for the price. I would not put a lot of pressure on the peg remover as it doesn't appear to be very strong. A good value though.
NEG 	The Chair is more like a green/dark grey color. Different from the photo (medium grey) . For my little space works fine. Read the measurements before, is very small.
NEG 	Nice book but definitely for a more mature reader than I was anticipating
NEG 	Love it, and it's so beautiful. But didn't give 5 stars because the seem could be neater. I'm hoping that it will hold up to repeated usage.
NEG 	I wanted something for everyday n this is perfect..
NEG 	Not sure about the protection aspect yet! Came on time and fit the phone!
NEG 	Cute suit! Love the ruffle and when it goes up while swimming you still have coverage from the high waisted bottom. Ordered a second one in a different color combo
NEG 	Great product! The case itself scratches easily though. Everything else seems to work just fine
NEG 	these are really soft and comfortable but I think they run a little big
NEG 	This stamp isn’t very beginner friendly, but I also think that it’s probably the same for all nail stamps. It took a while for me to figure out how to get the polish to stick to the stamp. But after many practice rounds (and YouTube videos) I figured it out! I love the wide selection of templates. Once you get the hang of it, it’s fun to design your own nails!
NEG 	very nice pillows for decorative covers, but not quite as full as I would like.
NEG 	Meets my basic need.
NEG 	Great sturdy cable! Looks long lasting. I just hope they are all 3 feet long. Since the longer one charges slower. The 3 feet works great
NEG 	Did not like how my package was handled
NEG 	Nice umbrella for the money. Thin lightweight fabric that I hope holds up thru many summers. So far so good. Love the Lime Green.
NEG 	Great chew toy and not as easy to destruct, although my Parsons Jack Russell is pretty good at demolishing toys. He has chewed the edges off already and there are little bits of rubber laying all over, but it lasts longer than other toys. All in all some of his favorite toys
NEG 	They are very thin, but if you're just trying to root out some starts for a few weeks, it's good enough for that.
NEG 	I haven't been able to use it tracking a critter yet. I have tested it in various "simulations" to ensure it will help me. I got it because I'm red/green color blind so I sometimes struggle picking up blood on it's own which is frustrating. I do feel this will help me greatly after testing it out. The strength of the light and overall build quality is excellent. I now keep it in my hunting pack at all times to help when the moment comes.
NEG 	I bought 3- one each for fridge and 2 freezers. When they tip over they spill. Would give 5 stars if had mesh covering to prevent spillage. I made my own with a few layers of cheesecloth over the holes.
NEG 	Bought this and gifted to a friend. This stuff is amazing. She's been getting eyelash extensions for years but The cost of those extensions were too expensive. So I bought this stuff Because she mentioned about this type of product. She was thrilled to get the serum. She loves this so much and I'm glad I got this.
NEG 	Works well. Nice color. Don't use it as much as I thought I would.
NEG 	Very basic cheap sleeve. it will keep scuffs to a minimum.
NEG 	I'm buying another, because the one I bought in April of 2017 is finally coming apart. Value, you bet. I put 40,000 miles on my car every year, and if I rent a car I take it with me. Easy install? Eh, I drive an SUV so I've grown accustomed to adjusting it when it needs it.
NEG 	Everything they said it would be. Some were better than others but overall they all were good.
NEG 	Absolutely love the crackers the flavor if you’re doing low-carb I give them a thumbs up. The downside is they are very costly for a cracker and I wish I could buy them somewhere and not have them shipped because they arrive mostly broken up. I had a hard time finding one whole cracker in the bay
NEG 	Flash/light does not work
NEG 	.Good quality we're definitely buy from the seller I received it very quickly I would definitely order again from this company
NEG 	Like the look and initial quality of this product.
NEG 	This would have 5 stars but it cut my internet speed in half, 200 Mbps down to 91 Mbps. Other than that an awesome product.
NEG 	If you just need to consume some calories and protein, this works. It definitely doesn't taste amazing or even remotely natural, and it's a bit on the thick side, but for convenience it's completely fine and the after taste dissipates pretty quickly. Tastes a bit like cheap chocolate with sweetener but as I said, the taste fades fast.
NEG 	Husband loves them they are very nice and sturdy
NEG 	Very comfortable and sturdy. Great amount of compression!
NEG 	can't answer the durability question just go the product.
NEG 	Nice beginner guitar for the price.
NEG 	It took a long time to wait. I planted them and really want beauty to grow.
NEG 	Ours broke and we needed a replacement. I found this one and it worked perfectly. Its now 5 months later and the down and back keys aren't working as well. (Probably cause its one of the most used keys.) I'm very satisfied with the price to value so I will be buying another.
NEG 	I really liked this film! I think the casting was key... the Actor who played Jovan had me engaged from the start with his moral dilemma. Overall, the acting was well done, the production quality was consistent and well executed and the storyline was fresh but with twists. You can tell the director spent a lot of time making each shot the best it could be. Great job by all involved.
NEG 	I literally put this out there 5 minutes ago immediately after the postman left and it seems to work. My water bath is ridged at the bottom so unfortunately the suctions won’t work but that’s not a fault of the pump. I like it but make sure you have this in direct sunlight and plenty of water in the bird bath.
NEG 	I'm really happy with the case. It's stylish and the color looks great. Complaints are that the pads on the bottom fell off (good thing replacements are included) and the keyboard cover doesn't lay as flat as I'd hoped.
NEG 	My sister bought this, but she said that she didn't read it throughly, since it had bad words or inappropriate parts. Book is complete.
NEG 	This is a cute swimsuit, but the top offers deceptively little coverage and tends to slip down when I'm moving around. Luckily, you can tighten the straps, so that does help a bit with that problem. Still, I would not recommend this swimsuit for anything who wears larger than a C cup.
NEG 	I did not dislike anything about the product it was a great fit and my son loves them
NEG 	Great sound. Video is good.
NEG 	Absolutely love this set!! Super pretty without being overdone, only wish the bra straps were adjustable! I’m 5’5” and 130 lbs for reference
NEG 	These were very adorable and though the one for the older kids was kind of small in length, it still made her dress pop!!
NEG 	I ordered these boots in brown and received them in black - my third order that was incorrect from this seller! That said, I probably would have kept them, but they were far too large even though I ordered a half-size down as indicated in other reviews. I would caution other buyers to consider ordering a full-size down. That said, the boots seemed sturdy and were comfortable when I tried them on, and the style is just as nice as in the photos. Might try ordering again in a smaller size and pray the fourth time is the charm!
NEG 	Came packaged nicely, however it was covered in lint..???? Super comfortable but the lint was rather annoying to remove.
NEG 	Both for myself as a gift. Can’t beat the price
NEG 	Lighter duty than previous printer MX 922 which we had for years. Paper tray capacity is smaller. Annoying that it forces you to use the rear paper feed for large format photo paper. It automatically changes the setting if you try to say you are printing 8 1/2 x 11 on photo paper. Main reason I chose the model is for the independent color ink cartridges. So many printers have a single cartridge for all colors resulting in a lot of waste when only one runs out.
NEG 	Sneezy sure sang a lot. If you like Hank and his music you should like this.
NEG 	Cute and served a purpose for a holiday party but not high quality for heavy use or multiple uses. I wear size 9 women’s, shoe covers fit well but pointed toe doesn’t stand up like in picture and I kept tripping over it.
NEG 	Absolutely wonderful need to get 3 more
NEG 	The charging and mounting worked great, but the release for the phone grip is a button behind the phone. Usually, without a case, your phone can depress this button and close the grip. However, some cases will have a gap near the button such that the button doesn’t depress.
NEG 	Frame isn't wood but looks close. Sturdy board for the price.
NEG 	I bought this thinking it was an iron on product for tshirts, but it is for decals. You also need to purchase transfer paper with it. For sticker decals, this is ok, its easier than rolls in certain ways.
NEG 	Really cute! Ordered it for a toddler, fit perfect. Does come folded so takes a while to flatten.
NEG 	Air needle is located in a compartment on the pump handle. Otherwise a good product.
NEG 	One of my favorite movies . Drama and passion. Kinda predictable but still great for all ages.
NEG 	This movie is a good classic
NEG 	The pockets inside the bag are not thought out well. It makes it hard for this bag to be used for general daily purposes. It is only best for thin books and laptops. Otherwise good quality.
NEG 	This was for gift-giving.
NEG 	Wow! I love this cookbook! This cookbook are simple to follow and very healthy as well. The recipes are extremely tempting and at first look sufficiently basic, with this extensive variety of recipes I can make diverse dishes for my family consistently.
NEG 	I received the wrong color the first time and had to reorder. But that happens.
NEG 	Bought for our camper because these won't break. We like the thumb notch in the handle and the size. Coffee doesn't stain them.
NEG 	I bought the teal color in both twin size and king size. The color is true to the picture - very bright. The twin size came rolled up in it's own container. The king size came vacuum packed and have may have been a return previously. I hope not b/c these are gifts. I did unzip the container and the blanket feels very soft. There is no smell. The price was great. So it is white on the sherpa side and teal on the top side. Now to the sage/green one. Very pale color but otherwise same as above. Again, a gift.
NEG 	I was looking for something to keep me warm and soft, lately I have anxiety thinking of going to ross/marshalls/tjmaxx to go through all the racks and try to find a hoodie or etc. and try them all in dressing rooms only to find out it is too big or small! Anyways thats why I ordered this from amazon, the thing is I really liked it but I wish it was a bit thick and keeps you more warm but overall I liked it. I am gonna wear in the house and maybe while sleeping now in LA it is getting cold at nights. But if you are looking for something to wear outdoors and keep you warm this is not the product for you,and pockets have a weird fabric inside like polyester which I do not like. And hand wash only which is a problem for me we will see how it goes 😀
NEG 	First one had a small leak on the faucet. Returned it, easy process. New one works great. Using it for church every week, so still holding up.
NEG 	Good shoes for the price
NEG 	This hatchet has very good head to total weight balance. I was disappointed with the narrow grip area on the handle. I plan on adding leather to the handle. Very sharp and stays that way.
NEG 	It does the job, but not as sturdy as we had hoped. We thought that we were getting a higher grade of metal, but it is what we ordered.
NEG 	I am disabled from terminal cancer, and pretty much doomed to live out the remainder of my days under home hospice and laid up on my comfortable couch. My large den is mostly lit by the neon signs I've purchased to adorn my man cave, with other lamps near the walls that sit on end tables and such. But I needed one light to hang over the arm of my couch with remote operation to give my immediate area some brightness at a touch, whether it be for reading or whatever. The lamp came in a deceptively small, but stout box. It assembled in moments, and was no problem to twist its light so that it hung directly over my shoulder and gave me the light I was needing. Its plenty bright to read by, or construct models, or whatever I can imagine I'd need. And the ability to adjust the light from a warm glow to a cool white is a nice touch. If I had any complaint, it would be the remote. Where still smaller than most other remotes I own, I don't think it warrants the need for five presets and AA batteries (not included). It's just a minor gripe that I thought I'd add on an otherwise perfect fit for what I was needing. A smaller remote that used AAA batteries and a smaller inventory of face buttons just seems much more feasible for such a simple device. For example, there is a button for "breastfeeding" that is indicated by the picture of a milk bottle. Ummm... okay then. But at any rate, great product! Keep in mind, I've only had it for only three days or so, so I cannot speak on item longevity.
NEG 	The speaker is nice looking, small and light. It looks exactly as the photo shows. The sound is ok. Definitely not Bose quality or even close to it. But for $18 the sound quality matches the price. I’m using this speaker for my bedroom, so it’s fine. I wouldn’t use this as a speaker for a large area like a living room.
NEG 	Well in the picture it says it has 2 vibrators when it really has only one. Other than that it's light and very versatile, I use it for my herniated disc and my epicondylitis and it's great that it's wireless cos I can take it with me to trips and restaurants and stuff. I just think the publicity has to be more accurate. It wouldn't hurt if it really had 2 vibrating points, and better yet, that not only the middle part vibrated but all 3 sections we're functional. Just an idea for Homedics.
NEG 	Another good Samantha Wolf mystery. I'm not usually big on supernatural type stories but it isn't over done and seems to fit perfectly with this series. I've enjoyed them all, and like another reviewer said, the stories just seem to get better and better. Each book can be stand-alone if you desire, as the author explains who the characters are in each story and each story has a satisfying conclusion, but it's much more fun to read them all and that's what I recommend. By the way, I'm a 68 year old male, so don't just consider them only for girls or younger readers. Now I've got to buy the next one so I don't miss anything!
NEG 	It's a very nice foundation. Not 5 star nice but good
NEG 	So far, so god. Just started playing this game.
NEG 	It's fun but she gets annoying! I am just glad she didn't "come to life" in the middle of the night forcing me to have to shoot it!!
NEG 	Great tap show for the price. My only complaint is the sound quality isn’t that great but to be expected at this price point.
NEG 	I really like this product, it very good! I will order more! 👌
NEG 	Fits and looks nice . Many color choices . No advertising on hat , comfortable sizing strap .
NEG 	THE BATTERY ONLY LAST ABOUT 4 HOURS BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S GOOD QUALITY.
NEG 	Love them!!! However, after I sanded and washed them, they were a bit rough and I feel like they might splinter.
NEG 	Not as loose fitting as I was suspecting.
NEG 	Performing well so far.
NEG 	This is made out of quality material. The Velcro is strong and the brace forces your shoulders back without pinching or discomfort. It is a smaller brace though and not one size fits all. It fits a child or someone with a small build the best. My 12 year old brother is using it and it fits well.
NEG 	I have 2 switches and we all know how sensitive they are. These glass protectors work great and are a must have for the switch especially with Mario maker 2 coming out...a game that will beg you to use a stylus to play
NEG 	It does it’s job. You get what you pay for. It works.
NEG 	They do the job so far
NEG 	great product, fast shipping. would highly recommend.
NEG 	Did not know the gauze pad is made of individual sheets .They tend to move around.
NEG 	The timer does what it's supposed to do. It's too soon to know if it saves me any money. There was a small bit of confusion in the wiring diagrams supplied : the main manual indicates that Terminals 1 and 3 need to be connected by a jumper wire and also Terminals 2 and 5. However, in the small enclosed package that has the jumper wires is a sheet that shows Terminals 1 and 5 to be connected and also Terminals 2 and 3. The problem is the supplied jumper wires are too short and those latter connections are impossible to make. It's a little confusing that there are two different jumper connection shown in the paperwork with the product. I went with the one that the wires were long enough to actually work with. In practice I suspect it doesn't matter. Beyond that confusion, the rest of the install was straight forward. Programming is pretty easy, the display however is rather small and you have to look at it closely. Doubling the size of the LCD would be nice ! The buttons were not as smooth as they could be. Sometimes a light press resulted in nothing happening and it was necessary to press rather firmly to get the display to change as expected. But once the setup is done, these don't have to be touched again unless the program needs to be altered. It is very easy to bring the water heater on out of cycle by just pushing the large button that is accessible without opening the timer door. It then stays on until the next programmed off cycle or until a user pushes the button again. I'll have to gather a few months of data to see how much I save by using this timer
NEG 	The sound is pretty good. If they would get a little louder, I could give them a 5 star. What I Love about these: When you pull it out of the charging case, it automatically connects to my phone. When I stick it back into the charger, it disconnects. The fit. I didn't know if the upside down, fill your ear design would be comfortable, but it actually is. It makes these very stable and I can even run with them in without them moving at all. LIke, I said before, if these got a little louder, I could give them a 5 star. I didn't notice that these were noise cancelling. So can't comment on that. I only ever keep on in, so that's probably why I didn't notice.
NEG 	I suppose product color is irrelevant due to what the intended use of this product is, but I'm still a little salty. 4 stars.
NEG 	Love my new jeans... definatly found my new place ! They fit great!
NEG 	Good book. Never read anything by this author prior to this but it was free in the sci-fi/fantasy section so I checked it out.
NEG 	I love its construction and looks. was expecting a little more clean low end though.
NEG 	I had a difficult time fitting one of the two mirrors in my bike handle. One side fits ok, but I could not get the other one all the way in the other side. Other than that, it's a nice mirror. I love the fact that it's adjustable in many ways, which gave me the flexibility I need. And it looks good on my black bike.
NEG 	Works great and reasonably priced.
NEG 	Bought this to tidy up some cords in my classroom (I'm a teacher). It's a bit narrower than I expected, but with a little work it fit everything I needed. My computer set up is now neat and out of the way! The included tool was super helpful in first getting the cords inserted.
NEG 	Good product. I haven’t used many others to compare but I like it and it was easy to clean.
NEG 	A little small but perfect for a ground blind.
NEG 	This meets my needs for recycling and still lets me pick up and dispose of my dog’s waste.
NEG 	Insightful, witty, perhaps unnecessarily verbose in places, and as with any book, you have to pan for the gold ... but those nuggets are there! This book will improve my writing, even if I do not 100% agree with all of the author's techniques.
NEG 	These cartridges are a great alternative to the OEM at a fraction of the cost. The only downside is you are guessing at what color you are opening unless you find the sticker of what color it is through the yellow bag that they are each individually packaged in. The shipping box is solid and the foam fits great. All 4 are in one box and arrived perfectly.
NEG 	has all that is needed
NEG 	Saw a difference in days Good buy
NEG 	It definitely is something you could make yourself but for the price you might as well buy this with your other special tools for fork work. It was very very handy for my seal replacement and made leveling my oil a breeze. Only thing I found wrong was it seemed on mine the measuring needle part was upside down as compared to videos I saw on it. Easy fix though, I didn't even flip it I just used math and subtracted from 300 instead of counting up from 0
NEG 	These are ok. I have to constantly stop and clean it out when using it. It works ok when you very first use it for about the first 10 seconds then after that, you have to stop every minute or so and clean it out and oil it so it cuts the hair. I purchased a Wahl clipper years ago and I remember that cutting my dog's hair like butter but after a few years it barely worked even after I put in a new blade so I purchased this. It's not great but it's ok.
NEG 	The arms on these are shorter than any other readers I have bought. Seem to be sized more for women than men. They look good, but don't fit that well for a man.
NEG 	Cute design, but the top flap is kind of awkward. When the toybox gets full the box kind of bows out in different directions and the top doesn't really close correctly. It's a little sloppy looking. I like that it's soft though so you don't have to worry about smashed fingers.
NEG 	Dog loves it. The sound is weird; sounds like there's an echo. I love that it comes with 2 covers.
NEG 	I am not an expert on chai. I am rating this tea solely on it's own merits and not in comparison to other types of chai. It smells wonderful with all the warm spices you expect. The bags are individually wrapped. The labels on the bags recommend a steeping time of 5 minutes. This made a smooth mug of tea. There was no bitterness. I added 1 teaspoon of unprocessed sugar. I tried it before adding milk. The taste of the tea was far less strong than the scent of the tea. Without milk, it made for a delicate and pleasant tea. I could have even let it steep another minute. For the tea to have a full-bodied flavor with milk in it, I had to leave the bag in as I drank it or steep 2 bags at once for 6 minutes. Of course, personal tastes determine how a person likes their tea, but this review may give you a general guideline. It tastes especially good with a couple of teaspoons of 'Hoosier Hill Farms' powdered coconut milk in it. It pairs beautifully with the warm spices.
NEG 	These gloves are perfect for pruning holly or pulling weeds, and they save me from the irritations usually caused because of my allergies.
NEG 	Not as what I thought as the high light pens.But my daughter love them.
NEG 	It’s a little small but it does the job
NEG 	This is a great solution to the problem we had of not having a DVD player to watch all the kids movies that my mother in law has foisted upon us. It can plug into the tv, but far better is the ability to let my toddler get her limited screen time anywhere she pleases without forcing me to watch the movies. The seller even offered to send a free car headrest mount so we can take movie on the road. It also has a usb and sd card port so digital files can be played in addition to the discs. The controls are so simple my toddler can operate it, and the swivel screen is a great feature that allows the buttons to be hidden from the prowling 1 year old determined to press buttons and wreak havoc.
NEG 	I got complimented already. Style, color and concept is great. Hate that it tangles easily. It's fashion jewelry. As expected, color changer and can tell it's ok quality
NEG 	They are cute, but the fit is just okay. Keep slipping off the back of my heel.
NEG 	Good for beginners, only downfall is the battery does not last long. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.
NEG 	Liked the small round size very much since I only have a few daily pills. Would like the colors to be different to easily pick the right one for the time of day.
NEG 	Wow better than I expected
NEG 	I like this item, easy to set up and use. The only thing I don't like is trying to get it back in the bag. ugh I bought a golf mat too so I could use it in my hall. Would be nice if a mat was included.
NEG 	Holds a lot of glasses.
NEG 	Great Bulb, work amazing
NEG 	It worked for what I needed it for
NEG 	I have a King 💤 # bed & it fits perfectly plus color is deep & rich as pictured. I have not washed it yet & I did have to air it out for a slight odor.
NEG 	Product received was as ordered. Shipping was delayed beyond original quote, however ordered product is a spare replacement, so no negative impact.
NEG 	Hard to evaluate; I lost a pet and that is what this represents.
NEG 	good sheets for the price
NEG 	These are good they work well
NEG 	the only thing was that the box had a whole in it but the puzzle inside was in a plastic bag with no damage.
NEG 	I love how great amazon is about preparing food and household products for shipping. Everything is always packaged so well and isn’t damaged during delivery. Even drinks!
NEG 	These are good movies. First one is the best. 2nd one is not too shabby. Both are certainly much, MUCH better than Jeepers Creepers 3. If you like horror films, give them a watch!
NEG 	Great modem and router combination. No more need to lease a modem from the cable company, so it paid for it self in less than a year.
NEG 	Great value for the money. It is a little firm, but it turns out that I like it that way. Plus it keeps you cool.
NEG 	The wheel is nice and easy to set up, The cord from the wheel to the console is very short however. Also, if you do not have a proper desk and chair setup to mount this to that allows alot of body movement and a stable mount for the wheel the setup will feel inadequate. I feel like one of the special racing seats also sold on amazon is almost necessary to fully enjoy this product. Also the plastic screws that allow you to mount the wheel to a desk feel flimsy and breakable
NEG 	Super soft and a great fit.
NEG 	My baby loves it. I little in the heavy side.
NEG 	The purse looks great, just too big for me. The wallet zipper broke the 2nd day. My coworker loves the purse.
NEG 	Installation was simple and functionality is exactly as described. Would recommend for LED lights.
NEG 	Very cute! Fits the note 9 well.
NEG 	Loved this dress! Very comfy and fits great! Material is a little thin but not see through. I bought a large, in the navy blue.
NEG 	Not a huge historical romance person, but I really enjoyed this book. It was a good read that flowed nicely. Author paid attention to detail and it wasn't to wordy with language that was used at that time.
NEG 	The Murmur took a bit to get going but in the end I enjoyed the book and was racing through the last few chapters. Lots of characters to follow and they all "talk" at some point, so you need to pay attention.
NEG 	Excellent read, intrigue suspense, whole lot of drama, betrayal, spiteful, confusion, revenge, and a whole lot of healing. I could not put this book down. Love the storyline but a little disappointed in the ending. Definite recommend.
NEG 	The water was great, but a couple of the bottles lid was cracked so the water leaked out. Since they were contaminated I had to dispose of them. However, I would order again.
NEG 	I like it however the scent is a bit strong. Definitely moisturizing!
NEG 	Order arrived on time and as described.
NEG 	I like the look and number of pockets but do wish the pockets were larger or the size of the bag overall was a little larger. I'm unable to fit some larger items (like my hairspray that I can't open to transfer to a travel size bottle) in there that I'm used to being able to fit in other toiletry bags.
NEG 	great craft brushes. a little too absorbent. sucks up most of my mod podge
NEG 	Great design. Comfy fabric
NEG 	Wearing it for the first time and there are some things I like and some things I don't. I ordered my regular bra size. The next size up might be too big, not sure. I like the fact that there is enough closure on the side that skin does not bulge out but if I had a say in the design I would add more coverage in front. It is low and it tends to push your breast toward the center which causes a bulge. I like the back support and I think it will be more comfortable after I get used to it. Will wear for a week before deciding if I will keep it. Update: after wearing it for a few days I have concluded this bra is great for small busted women....however, full figure women might find the front coverage not adequate. I moved all the adjustments as wide as they went and the bra is comfortable enough to most likely keep. Will wear a week before deciding.
NEG 	Needed this for a birthday gift. Arrived 10 days after ordering it, after I needed it to arrive, and customer service was very good with a refund. Pleased with them.
NEG 	Nicely sized to fit within the Instant Pot for easy storage. The magnets were what sold me on this vs. other similar sets. DISAPPOINTING. They do not have enough strength to adhere tightly and they will not conform to the curvature of the Pot. One magnet was damaged, but will not seek a replacement as it won't work on the Pot anyway.
NEG 	Not bad for what was paid
NEG 	I need a half size smaller. Love the variety of rings I received . Very comfortable!!!!
NEG 	These are great little rollers, however they were too small for what I needed them for.
NEG 	Fast delivery to Canada. Thanks
NEG 	Very fast delivery, just wish the designs were painted on and not made of plastic wrapping.
NEG 	I Initially had issues with these units being too quiet like others have said, however I solved this by moving the speakers from behind the cheek pads to in front of the cheek pads. So the speakers are now directly touching my ears when the helmet is on instead of having an additional layer of fabric in between. I also noticed the volume is different depending on audio source. Bike to bike is actually pretty loud I could hear my buddy fine even at 85 mph (he was hearing a bit of wind noise though). Music is a bit quieter followed by answering phone calls paired to a mobile phone being almost too quiet (before moving the speakers). Music quality is obviously not great but at this price point I was not expecting it would match any set of headphones. Battery life seems to be good as well went for 3 relatively long rides (music and intercom) and it didn't die. I am not aware of a way to check the state of charge. If you are looking for a good COMS system for the cheap at 40 bucks a unit these are a solid choice but if you want good music quality then consider other options.
NEG 	Pretty thin volume and some dated projects (a tie rack? maybe for a business dad?), but overall appealing to my kid with clear project instructions.
NEG 	Really great for price but it is lacking a bit of flavor once brewed.
NEG 	I gave 5 stars for battery life, but I truly can't say yet as it's still brand new. I've only been using this for about a week, but so far so good. There have been a few times the mouse doesn't respond, but it's only for a split second and doesn't stay that way. The spinning wheel for scrolling does feel a bit cheap and I'm concerned how well this will hold up through the wear and tear of normal everyday use, but it's doing okay so far. As far as looks go, it's super cute. I was in the market for a slim mouse and when I found this one with many different colors I couldn't pass it up. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase and would purchase it again.
NEG 	Kiera gets a call, play the game or her twin will die. A stupid joke, until Kevin didn’t pick up the phone. Few clues that don’t add up, to Kevin now missing. Inhaling a powder at his apartment, almost proved lethal for her. A tense, fast paced story, that gripped a reader from the first when she gets a call. The only drawback for me, was her attitude. Continuing on with the next book in series.
NEG 	Best price 50 leis.. only reason didn't give 5 star as size of flowers in all leis ar not same.. some are big as shown in pics.. and some are small... still good product..
NEG 	Cute, fun and would make a great gift for all ages!
NEG 	Very informative. Would have liked a little more elaboration on a few key principles but also appreciate the book was not made as an exhaustive study. Would definitely recommend,
NEG 	The lids I received were grey, not black. They do not close, but otherwise, they are great.
NEG 	When hitting the volume up/down button you can feel the give in the case and you can feel yourself hitting the buttons, but not on the power button. It feels hard and I can't tell if I am actually hitting the button or not. Case is really nice though. Very slick.
NEG 	Received this product fast! Next day with regular shipping. It works well and was priced right! I’ll definitely order it again when I need it.
NEG 	Bend kinda a weird way after awhile but the quality is still good and still charging my phone well!!!
NEG 	Does the trick well but annoying because the clips don't fit under all parts of our top rack on our Town and Country. Fixed by removing clips and reattaching but took a decent amount of time. But otherwise we like it
NEG 	There were a couple of fans that had broken thread and did not work properly, but they were what I needed for my event and they worked well.
NEG 	Have used this for a few years before purchasing online. Same product, affordable and lasting size. Very content.
NEG 	The case appears very sturdy and the color is gorgeous. I would prefer the rubber layer of the case fit a little more snug.
NEG 	So soft - and such vivid colors! My grandson loves it - his big sister has a mermaid tail that made him just a little bit jealous, so now he's set with this "macho" one! I even got him a soft orange astronaut helmet to wear with it - it's perfect! (Gramma Scores!)
NEG 	They are perfect besides the jack gets unplugged constantly
NEG 	The reflective material started falling off within a week. But they seem comfy.
NEG 	Ordered the t-shirt because i liked the style. I liked that it looked to run past the hips. I received in the mail and ordered XL and the shirt barely passes my bellybutton. I am tall and figured an XL would run pass my hips, but it didn't.
NEG 	Decent quality, it does what I want/need it to. It will sit in my closet so wasn't looking for or expecting a "show piece", especially at the price. Not great but not horrible either, really about what I expected maybe a little better even for the price. Sure the finish could have been better, but it isn't an $100+ showpiece either. It did include the watch pillows which was nice and wasn't 100% expected also.
NEG 	So, in terms of sizing, I would say if you want it to fit as your regular size- most likely size up. I was worried based on the model sizing pics and went up 2 sizes, from a M to an XL and it fits but is definitely long on me and a little baggy but I guess thats good since I'm 15 weeks pregnant and have room to grow into it but if you want it to fit like your regular size, only go up 1 size if even that.
NEG 	I think is very nice gun , for the money is good ! I have used contractors gun from graco and feel just like it . Plus extra filters. Great deal.r
NEG 	Not bad. Just a lil to big.
NEG 	Not a huge fan of the flavor but it works so I keep buying it! Spicy. My friend LOVES the flavor soooo
NEG 	Works but not as nice to turn and use to tighten.
NEG 	First sword I bought on Amazon and honestly not that disappointed, the only critique that I have is that it came and what looks like very used condition there's stains all over the sword itself and the sheath, it also had a very weird smell to it.
NEG 	Protects iPhone in a compact design but allows phone's appearance to show through.
NEG 	I love the ease of printing my own photos, but the cartridge and paper are expensive compared to getting prints at a local store.
NEG 	Really pretty color, nice quality, fits my phone perfectly, and has pronounced buttons for easy use. I only wish I could fit more than one card in the card holder slot.
NEG 	Some of the tips were damaged, however, they are very nice. Love the variety of colors.
NEG 	Will come in handy on the beach
NEG 	They are nice bags for the price. We used them for my daughter's birthday party as goodie bags and personalized them for each girl. While we were ironing on some of the letters the bag seemed to get to hot and now have little ripples in them not bad enough that they can't be used but that's why I gave them 4 stars since they said they could be used with iron-on transfers also the strings seem cheap but it goes with the price paid. They did turn out cute and I think the girls will love them!
NEG 	It fits tight and make sure you wash it by hand and don’t put it in the dryer
NEG 	These are really cute, however, I rated these 4. When completely screwed on, the flowers are not even on each side. I’d have to loosen the one end in order for them to match up.
NEG 	Works really well, but months later I still have to pick off little pieces of cotton on me from the towel after drying off.
NEG 	Daughter loves it. Is wearing it tomorrow for Halloween and will use it for dress up after that.
NEG 	Ii would have given it a 5 star rating, but the non-stick coating is delaminating from both the upper tray and the inside bottom of the basket. This surprises me a little bit, as I’ve always hand washed and it’s never been in the dishwasher.
NEG 	Exactly what I needed to hang my plates.
NEG 	Nice build, fits perfect. Great product for the price.
NEG 	All good except that the button for the tilt mechanism is way too high up for me to use, so basically, that function is useless.
NEG 	Not as laugh-out-loud funny as some of the other Vacation movies, but clever.
NEG 	For the value it works great. Although, I would recommend hosing it out occasionally.
NEG 	Spiritual concepts made personal through characters. Comforting, gentle thoughts.
NEG 	Would have given five stars if this included the labels.
NEG 	Work great. After a couple tailgates these start losing grain. No major complaints though.
NEG 	Works great but came with a corner broken.
NEG 	These are super cute. They look nicer in person. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are very wide. But other than that they are great.
NEG 	Love these excellent quality and my kids love them, but wish they made a truck or car to pull them with! Also the only complaint is that because they are close when attached, when turning curves the magnets will sometimes catch each other and mess up the creation!
NEG 	Works well for our bathroom counter. We have really tiny counters so this is perfect to keep things organized and out of the way. Easy to clean and very nice to have. I recommend this product.
NEG 	Arrived just as stated
NEG 	Good product. Feels solid which is nice but I have a bit of trouble latching it onto some tire stems without leaking a bit of air, but once it is on its fine.
NEG 	I liked the hero and heroine. Their chemistry felt real and compelling. The mystery’s ending, however, felt abrupt and unresolved.
NEG 	Enjoying my fire hd.
NEG 	Which movie & tv shows news.
NEG 	I love these crackers. But somehow these didn’t taste quite the same as the crackers that come in the small packages.
NEG 	The silver in the band isn't as silver or shinny as in pictures, but still looks good. Looks like it might last through some rough wear, but we'll see.
NEG 	This is a good sized screen but is not lined in the back however this dosent appear to be an issue if theres no light coming from behind the screen. My kids hook the xbox up to it and play video games on it and we had outdoor movie night and it worked great! It is a light frame and will need to be weighed down a little if its breezy outside. I am very happy with this purchase!
NEG 	These help me with toe alignment blisters
NEG 	Works for a bike carrier!
NEG 	Used for exercising with abdominal hernia Seems to be helping
NEG 	Used for medical purposes. Smell was pleasant and mild. No irritation. Pump makes it easy to use.
NEG 	Works good. I have a small dog who does not let toe nail clippers anywhere near her. This allows me to somewhat trim her nails. For a less scared dog, this will work even easier. It has two speeds and is lightweight and easy to hold. Charged fast.
NEG 	Very official looking. Slightly blurry but not enough to be problematic. Seems durable. I like that the fields of text are somewhat customizable to protect my privacy.
NEG 	I love the tools, they are great! Work well and made well. The stencils are just paper so they aren't the easiest to use because you have to be very careful with them in order to not ruin them. The tools are really handy and pretty much any design you decide to do there is a tool for. The tools are well worth the price of the set and the stencils are just a bonus.
NEG 	The blue tooth keyboard case was easy to pair to the iPad. It comes with a charger. The case is nice and slim its not bulky as you might think for a keyboard case. I like that there are multiple angle options for propping up the iPad. The magnetic closure is good and strong. I just wish that it would auto sleep and wake upon open and close.
NEG 	Pretty good but the material somehow bleeds or turns darker over time
NEG 	I like this duvet but it's not for everyone. I chose this one because it claimed to be an all season duvet cover and so far that's held up true for winter, I haven't gotten to test it out in summer yet. I needed something to keep me warm yet be light enough to not cause my fiance to sleep hot, I didn't notice that the covering was 100% polyester and thus he still sleeps hot yet not as much as before. This is the only downside I have found in this duvet so far besides the fact that it doesn't fit properly in the two cal king duvet covers i purchased separately, it's about 4 inches smaller than my covers. But all in all it is a thin duvet that keeps me warm and is soft to the touch so I'm happy with it
NEG 	Our two kitties like this wet food. We also feed them Stella & Chewies chicken & a high quality kibble so they get well balanced meals.
NEG 	The only drawback is the way they plug in. The large USB connection sticks out a couple of inches and therefore tends to get knocked around.
NEG 	Second time I bought this product. Gave one to my sister who also got a Samsung Galaxy Note 9.
NEG 	Ok but have an aftertaste when using with water
NEG 	This product was semi easy to put together and fits well in the location it was purchased for.
NEG 	Good size, easy to use. But they came very dull, and sharpening them from dull was not simple. But I'm happy with them
NEG 	It was a gift, don't think they have opened it. sorry
NEG 	They are a gift, so I don't know if they will wash well.
NEG 	I really like this product. It feels good to get a little head massage but I find it best to use when you're ready to go to bed or can at least relax. My eyes shake/vibrate when it's on and it's actually pretty uncomfortable for me. But I do love this product! I just have to close my eyes.
NEG 	The first one was broke due to poor packaging. The replacement came in beter packaging. Looks really cool and had several comments about it from Friends. I give it 4 stars do to the poor packaging and having to send back.
NEG 	Amazingly cute!! They are a Xmas gift so I still don’t know if theyre comfy but they look amazing
NEG 	I have had the elastic version of this belt for some time now in a navy color and really like it except for the fact that being elastic when I unbuckle it, it will pop out of my belt loops so decided to try the clear plastic one. I find the elastic type to be more comfortable than the clear plastic but works well also and does not pop out of my belt loops.
NEG 	Light came intact and safe but one of the two lights wasnt working. Oak leaf has great customer service and sent two new ones to me within the week. The lights are very pretty and add a great accent, they do feel a bit fragile though.
NEG 	Nice pillow covers. Great to put on over your existing pillow to update for the fall. Lightweight and should be easy to clean.
NEG 	My son loved his lego themed balloons. And so did all the kids at his party. The only reason for 4 stars is because some of the balloons lost their faces when it was blown up. Not many though. I’d still buy them again.
NEG 	I loved on how the writer explains everything in sequence, even if it some parts were way too technical and are not for everyone to comprehend. Found a lot of interesting/previously-unknown facts and felt that I actually got something out of the book.
NEG 	Awesome lock good outside in desert weather. The numbers dont unlock in the center and if its dark kind of a pain. But will buy another
NEG 	Work great just impossible to get completely clean
NEG 	Likes: great design, well built. Dislike: I have a tendency to want to lean slightly on the table but am afraid to with the 20 pound capacity.
NEG 	Good read that held my interest! It kept me guessing who the murderer was. Loved the different personalities of the main characters. Hope you're still writing.
NEG 	I like how it looks.
NEG 	Great product easy to install very sturdy
NEG 	My dog seems to like it
NEG 	doesn't have the range promised. Works pretty well, though.
NEG 	Bought for acne for my son. Does a good job. Does not foam up, but it does seem to be working just fine.
NEG 	Fun game for the family. I was a little disappointed that the box came with a hole in it. It was a gift for my my brother and didn't have time to return it. Bit of a bummer.
NEG 	This came out to be exactly what I wanted. It wasnt see thru and it provided the privacy I needed. The only thing was my dog liked to take the leaves off 🙄.
NEG 	Enjoyed this story very much. The mystery and romance were well intertwined. It almost Made me want to believe in ghosts.
NEG 	I really like this iced coffee. Great product. Also wonderfully packaged and shipped. I had an issue previously with way product was packaged and condition in which product arrived. Amazon replaced and perfectly presented.
NEG 	For the price I paid this unit is a good mix of versatile and portable. Good for visiting with friends or other small social occasions.
NEG 	Good product but too expensive
NEG 	Entertaining and not typical
NEG 	Easy to play. Good time waster.
NEG 	Was a great gift and since I am listening to it as well. I can say it is worth purchasing, especially if you are going on a long trip.
NEG 	I love this strap. I use it as a safety strap when I carry my DSLR with a large lens. I am able to secure it close enough that when I walk long distances, the strap carries some of the weight instead of it all being on my hand. Only problem with it, for me....the carabiner is metal and connects to the camera plate which is also metal. So, when I walk they clink against one another. Bad news for a wildlife/bird photographer. So, I am currently searching for a solution to that. Maybe a plastic connection or a small strap. We'll see. Update: I used a bolt cutter to cut off the steel snap with swivel from the webbing and replaced it with an aluminum carabiner. Problem solved.
NEG 	I like these rubber protectors because they provide grip and the clear protector was cool because my laptop has lights and they shine through it, but the only con of this was it stretched out and it doesn't fit my laptop properly anymore
NEG 	This is cute but not as I expected. About the size of your night stand. Can hold 50 files the way it's designed.
NEG 	They are leak proof, durable, and good for traveling, however some of the lips on the cups were messed up and the lids were also sometimes wonky. I ended up having to throw out some non-usable ones.
NEG 	Loved it! However, some of these come with a little design that has a pointy end (ex. The star) and at times it’s uncomfortable for the kids. But bc you get so many you have plenty of options of the safer ones.
NEG 	Very soft, and actually has deep pockets. Fabric is thin so will hold off on durability
NEG 	This works great, on my home made pie crusts. Friends think I have skills, but I don't. Very happy.
NEG 	This product is such a great idea, being able to write on the magnetic strip. I used it to assign tablets at work to employees for each shift
NEG 	I don’t think this thing came with instructions, but it was easy to set up regardless. Took about 15 minutes to set up. We had 3 adults in this tent and still had plenty room left to spare. You can fully stand up in this tent.
NEG 	Advice.. Measure twice & order once. Looks to be very good quality, unfortunately I ordered too large so waiting for the new one. Confident it will be of equal quality.
NEG 	This is a beautiful and well made wallet EXCEPT that the snap closure does not allow ant “give” when the wallet is filled. Snapping it closed is difficult. If that problem is corrected it would be perfect!
NEG 	Very pleased with my purchase. The only not con: the specially designed trays: for bowls, plates...they don’t work. This product would be 5 stars if they just supplied 4 flat trays as opposed to the differently designed trays. They don’t fit any plates or bowl I have. And I’ve tried all of them. For reference I have fiesta ware dishes and also replay brand kid dishes. None of the bowls or plates fit in the weird trays provided. But I’m still able to use it and it still works good enough. Pleased with the available drying space and pleased it doesn’t take up too much counter space. Easy to assemble. Very functional for use with window plants as well.
NEG 	So far my son really likes this Headset!
NEG 	Great addition to the Halloween costume
NEG 	Nice collection of one of our favorite sci-fi series with plenty of extras about the makings of the show and the evolution of the storyline. However, some scenes in the middle of some episodes lose their focus or definition for some unknown reason.
NEG 	Very pleased with this purchase ..
NEG 	Don’t be a fool and but HDMI cables from your local store. These are just as good if not better and at better price. Used these on an installation and they worked as they should.
NEG 	The ONLY reason I didn’t give this 5 stars is bcuz of the sting. It was kind of pointless since it didn’t really tighten the fit and then fell out first wash. But the fit itself is spot on! They’re extremely soft && cute. Prob my favorite comfy pants now !
NEG 	Bought the set for both specifically for relocation. They are cheap and get the job done, especially a set of 5 can move substantial amount of clothes (3 suits OR 6 dress shirts on hangers in each bag). It was perfect as the moving company provides clothes hanging boxes and I do not want to have the clothes contact them. The problem was that the zipper was fairly weak. I only used the zipper once on all of them, and the zipper on one bag already failed. The material is on the flimsy side as well. For the price it was a great one time temporary use, for something that you will reuse a lot, it'll be better to invest in something with better quality.
NEG 	Great product, wished price was lower
NEG 	One thing that drives a person nuts is trying to find a missing puzzle piece. Yep, one border piece missing and the company is unable to replace this piece. However, pieces fit snug and clean, which enables one to pickup three or four pieces that have been put together and move to the main puzzle. My wife, who has dementia was able to work with the larger pieces. Overall, this is a great puzzle.
NEG 	Anything made by Gorilla is great...this is no different. I used it to secure loose exterior faucet to brick....works like a champ.
NEG 	Very nice and great quality.
NEG 	A good value. It's great to have the latches; it's great to see through the tote to see what's inside.
NEG 	Great toilet paper but the rolls are really large. Didn't fit well unless I took some sheets off first.
NEG 	Came apart real easy. To small for growing African grey
NEG 	Easy to use, still learning.That I can get help of O should need it.
NEG 	Works as intended. I would add a couple of nice touches as a light up remote control and longer wall electric plug. Not a lot of instructions, but really is so simple to install anyone can figure it out. will order extra to gift.
NEG 	I have huge boobs so it hard to find anything that will fit right and I jean completely right. I how ever love the way it fits
NEG 	I ordered for a friend who wanted them. She thought they'd be larger in size but theyre sturdy looking. It's costume jewelry
NEG 	My only complaints about this tent is it had a weird smell to it for the first couple of days sure that's typical with any tent & the zipper is loud & sometimes catchy. All the poles & corner pieces are metal not plastic. I put electrical tape at each connection helped with the rattling & the squeaking.
NEG 	Great story that follows Marisol and Chase from Possess through Valentine's Day. It is a super sweet story that you don't have to have read Possess to enjoy. But is also a very nice addition to learn more about what happens to them if you have read the main story already.
NEG 	I liked the ideal of how it works and after first use, hearing strange sounds. In my opinion the hose connections seemed to be a little delicate.
NEG 	Product was as described. Looks good and blends well.
NEG 	This is lovely and exactly what I wasn’t looking for - but a large (my normal size) was a bit loose around the chest. The item description says this will only work for A-C, but I’m a DD and think it’s fine. It was right enough around “the girls” but was loose around the band. I’m 5’3’’ and 160lbs. I don’t know my normal band and cup size because I exclusively wear bralettes.
NEG 	I really liked it easy to use.
NEG 	Good grip on these cups because of the perforated outer shell design.
NEG 	This set worked perfectly for my daughters trolls themed 2nd birthday party.
NEG 	Loooks nice. Soft fabric. Material is just as expected. Well worth the money.
NEG 	I love the way the journal feels, and the pages are thin, but still sturdy enough to hold up to markers, glue, and whatever else you want to stick inside your journal. There's also a nice pocket at the back for holding inserts. I've gotten a different color of this journal before and have been overall happy with it. The journal has a Key Page, three index pages, two pen test pages, and a mindfulness page. the key and index pages are before the journal and not included in the numbered pages (which is perfect, I find the index very useful). The pen test, and mindfulness pages, however, ARE included in the page numbers. they're located at the end, and not terribly obstructive. But slightly annoying. According to the product description there should be 201 pages PLUS the pen test and mindfulness page. I've gotten their journals before, I have this exact one in a different color and it has 201 pages plus the extras so I'm not sure why the burgundy one doesn't. Not a huge deal, but frustrating considering I'm using this specific journal for a project and I want to use all 200 pages.
NEG 	I purchased these to use in a home office. They are made very durable and look nice. They hold markers and erasers nicely. They are designed to be mounted by screws, which are not included. Overall, I am happy with my purchase...
NEG 	In spite of some reviews, I think this is a decent, lightweight travel case for jewelry. I like the color, zipper and compartments. I was looking for something specifically designed to hold multiple necklaces with thin chains that tangle easily, and something that could handle multiple pairs of dangly earrings. I don't have a ton of rings and heavy bracelets, so I didn't need that kind of storage. This one will work. I just wish could find one that is more artistic (perhaps featuring the art of famous artists, or rock 'n' roll, edgy themes, etc.) and made out of organic cotton/linen or hand-tooled leather (boho) for a decent price. These plastic quilted cases are not exactly my style, and the cloth jewelry rolls don't seem to have the structure or storage I need. Thoughts? Anyone?
NEG 	They sound very good. I’m quite pleased with the audio quality. The metal machining is also very expensive looking but the edges are a bit sharp. The cord is sturdy and looks like it would last a long time, but I am disappointed in how easily tangled it is. The cord is a bit sticky, so it’s harder to just shake out the tangled parts like I would expect from a non tangle cord.
NEG 	Have to have the app open for it to receive data. That’s stupid

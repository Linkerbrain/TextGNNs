CCAT	Germany's minister for aerospace added his voice on Tuesday to industrialists calling for France to privatise its national company, Aerospatiale, as part of much-needed industry consolidation. "We can't have a restructuring of European industry if we don't have something that is close to a privatisation process. I think this is very important," Norbert Lammert, parliamentary state secretrary at the Federal transport ministry and coordinator for German aerospace industry told reporters at the Paris air show. Aerospatiale is the French Airbus partner Executives at Airbus partners British Aerospace Plc (BAe) and Daimler-Benz Aerospace have used the air show to urge the privatisation of Aerospatiale, to help speed up the conversion of Airbus into a single corporate entity -- which is seen as a big step in consolidating European industry. Lammert said the French Socialist party had been hostile to privatisations in the recent parliamentary election campaign so he did not expect a sell-off "in the next few weeks". But he added, "I think there will be political support. We should also have political agreement to support the industrial process". The fourth Airbus partner is Casa of Spain, which is also state-owned.
GCAT	Bosnians supporting opposition politicians in the northwest of the country around Bihac are so frightened of reprisals they may not vote in upcoming elections, a U.N. spokesman said on Wednesday. "U.N. monitors... believe that this intimidation may continue up to the elections," U.N. spokesman Alex Ivanko told reporters in Sarajevo. "It will have dire consequences for the whole election process because people that support opposition parties will prefer, for security reasons, not to exercise their right to vote." U.N. police operating in the Moslem-controlled Bihac area reported eight explosions there in the past week, all of them directed at people supporting candidates or parties in opposition to the ruling Moslem nationalist SDA party. "If the local authorities in Bihac are interested in having free and fair elections they only have weeks, if not days, to get their act together, although their committments are doubtful right now," Ivanko said. Active harassment and intimidation of the political opposition in the Bihac area began in June when an SDA loyalist struck Bosnia's former Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on the head with an iron pipe. Silajdzic resigned his government position and broke with the SDA in January, forming his own party to run in opposition to the SDA for a seat on Bosnia's collective Presidency. Ivanko said U.N. monitors in the Bihac area had received a letter from one of the local opposition parties accusing nine police officers and eight SDA supporters of intimidation. Last week, U.N. police Commissioner Peter Fitzgerald met interior ministers from Bosnia's Moslem-Croat federation and its Serb republic who agreed to instruct local police to support free and fair elections. "They (the interior ministers) either failed to issue these orders, which is possible, or there was some bogus communication breakdown throughout the country, which I think is not very much possible," Ivanko said. Ivanko said commissioner Fitzgerald would contact local police directly to get his message across even though "we have some unconfirmed reports that people are being intimidated by local policemen". Political intimidation also took place in Serb-controlled Teslic earlier in the week. Ivanko reported that a factory director was forced from his job on Monday because of his opposition to the ruling Serb nationalist SDS party. He was the second factory manager in Teslic to be replaced in the past week -- both by SDS supporters.
CCAT	Times Mirror Co said advertising revenues for Times Mirror's Newspaper Publishing Group for the four weeks ended December 31, 1996, fell 10.6 percent to $131,864,000 from $147,509,000 in the prior year. For the 1996 fourth quarter, advertising revenues totaled $434.5 million versus $434.8 million in year ago quarter. The December period and fourth quarter 1996 results reflect five fewer days than the comparable periods in 1995.   In the January period and first quarter 1996, operating results reflected six additional days compared to the comparable 1995 periods, the company said. For the fifty-two weeks January 1, 1996 through December 31, 1996, total advertising revenues rose 1.0 percent to $1,574,450,000 compared with $1,558,157,000 for the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995. The year-to-date results for 1996 contained one more day than the 1995 results.

ECAT	Poland's gross domestic product (GDP) will meet the government's 1996 GDP growth target of five to six percent if strong industrial output growth continues, deputy head of the Central Statistic Office said. Roman Sawinski told a news conference that GDP growth should remain high in the fourth quarter due to a strong rise in industrial output, expected to stay around the 7.3-percent year-on-year level from third-quarter 1996. "At such high levels of output, one should expect growth in fourth quarter to reach about seven to eight percent and to meet the target envisaged in the 1996 budget," Sawinski said. Sawinski said GDP bottomed out at year-on-year 3.5-percent growth in the first three months of 1996 before picking up to 5.2 percent in the second quarter. That compares with robust 1995 growth of seven percent. He said 1996 growth was mostly fuelled by a jump in domestic demand, spurred by investment and fast growth of real wages. "The fast pace of industrial output should solidify the high growth rate for Poland's GDP," Sawinski said. In October, Poland's industrial output rose 13.9 percent year-on-year, and average wages in the enterprise sector rose nearly seven percent in real terms. Retirement pensions rose 2.3 percent in real terms in ten months of 1996 following the last one-off increase in September. In the first nine months of the year, total investment spending in Poland reached 24 billion zlotys and was 26.5-percent higher than in the same period of 1995. -- Krzysztof Wojcik +48 22 653 9700

Speaking about Tuesday's Budget Policy Statement on Radio New Zealand's Morning Report, Peters said there was significant fat in the system and he was going to find out where it was. Asked how much fat there was, he said: "It's probably hundreds of millions if we are good enough at doing our job".   Peters said he was confident that members of the government would not cross the floor to vote against his proposal for a referendum on compulsory pensions. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746
CCAT	South Korea's Taehwa Shopping Co Ltd filed an application with a Pusan court on Monday to protect the company from its creditors, a Securities Supervisory Board statement said. The statement said high financing costs caused the company to file the application for court receivership. Analysts said Taehwa Shopping, based in the port city of Pusan, had faced worsening financial problems since department stores run by the nation's large conglomerates or chaebol opened outlets in Pusan, leading to fierce competition.   Analysts said Taehwa Shopping had invested substantial amounts to expand its department store and to build more branches. Taehwa Shopping posted 14.67 billion won in net loss on 144.92 billion turnover in calendar 1996 from a 3.02 billion profit on 180.51 billion sales a year earlier. The statement said Taehwa's assets totalled 296.39 billion won with 260.75 billion in liabilities last year. It showed Taehwa's corporate bond issuances, which mature on December 21, 1999, totalled 69 billion won.   The Korea Stock Exchange halted trading in Taehwa Shopping through Monday. The bourse said it would resume trade in the shares from Wednesday but the shares would be placed on a supervision list. -- Seoul Newsroom (822) 727 5647

ECAT	California state Treasurer Matt Fong said on Monday he sold $162 million in state public works board refunding revenue bonds. The $162 million sale, completed on Friday, was the third refunding sale in as many weeks, producing combined savings to taxpayers of more than $31 million. "In all three recent refundings, our preparation and continued monitoring of the market allowed us to take advantage of falling interest rates to generate millions of dollars in savings for California taxpayers," Fong said. The $162 million issue included the sale of $40 million in 1996 Series D California Community College refunding bonds. All three refundings were scheduled for sale on September 4 but were postponed due to market conditions, Fong said.
ECAT	The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that Hungary's low economic growth rate may pick up over the next few years and catch up with the growth rates in Poland or the Czech Republic. "I expect gradually increasing growth rate," said Willy Kiekens, a member of the IMF's board of directors, told a news conference. "I think it could catch up with the Polish or the Czech level in the next few years.   The rate of GDP growth dropped to 1.5 percent last year, according to preliminary figures, from 2.9 percent in 1994 after Hungary introduced an economic austerity programme last March to rein in its soaring budget and current account deficits. Economic growth was quicker in both the Czech Republic and Poland, countries which, similarly to Hungary, are in transition to a market economy and hope to join the European Union. The Czech GDP increased by some five percent last year, and almost seven percent in Poland.   Hungary expects a growth rate below one percent for this year and some two to three percent in 1997. Members of the IMF's board of directors visiting Hungary told reporters the austerity programme may have slowed GDP growth, but the measures were necessary to stabilise the economy and create the conditions of sustainable growth. "In the second half of 1994 and in the first half of 1995, the economy was in a very fragile situation," Kiekens said. "In mid-term, there is a positive correlation between economic adjustment and growth," said Bernd Esdar, member the IMF's board of directors.   Esdar added that "Hungary achieved tremendous progress" and as a result of the economic programme the country has been able to significantly reduce its budget and current account deficits and inflation, while real wages have slumped, however. Kiekens told Reuters that Hungary's economic growth is likely to pick up if the country continues to reduce inflation and provided its fiscal deficit, not including debt service on loans to be taken over from the central bank, drops in 1997 to three percent of GDP from this year's four percent target.

GCAT	Ruthann Aron, a former Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate and a member of the Montgomery County planning board, was indicted by a grand jury Thursday on new charges that she tried to poison her husband. The grand jury also indicted Aron, 54, on two counts of soliticing someone to murder her husband and a Baltimore lawyer, a state prosecutor said. Aron, was arrested last month as part of an elaborate sting operation set up after an informant called police and said Aron wanted the name of a hit-man. The Montgomery County Council also passed a resolution removing Aron from the seat on the planning board she has held since 1992, council president Marilyn Praisner said.
CCAT	Galileo Technology Ltd filed Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to register a public offering of up to 2.75 million ordinary shares.

ECAT	China's ballooning foreign reserves have not grown too large and the issue that needs attention is how to ensure the international balance of payments, a senior finance official said. The debate on whether the size of China's foreign reserves, which stood at $100.45 billion on November 12, was misinformed, the Business Weekly newspaper on Sunday quoted an unidentified official of the State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC) as saying. "What we should consider is not whether the reserves are too big or too small, but how to coordinate foreign exchange management with monetary policy in order to keep the balance of international payments and fulfil macro-economic targets," the newspaper quoted the official as saying. The central bank, the People's Bank of China, had never specified a target for the size of China's reserves, and these had been allowed to grow to ensure exchange rate stability, he said. The large size of the reserve was an unavoidable consequence of central bank currency operations as the bank had been forced to buy foreign currencies to balance supply and demand and to halt upward pressure on the domestic renminbi currency, he said. Since exports boomed in 1994, China's foreign exchange reserves had increased by 300 percent, the official said. There was no sign of a reduction in reserves in the short term because of weak import demand, partly as a result of a three-year-old tight monetary policy, he said. Even after the April 1 tariff cuts, China's foreign trade surplus had widened -- with officials expecting a $18 billion gap at the year end, he said. The official discounted inflationary pressure from the size of the reserves, saying the central bank had tried to offset the impact by recovery of relending, issue of bonds and launching repurchase of treasury bills. In the first three quarters of the year, 52.2 billion yuan ($6.3 billion) spent on buying foreign exchange was withdrawn from circulation through central bank operations, reducing the basic input of money to 144.9 billion yuan, he said. This move had been a factor in falling inflation this year despite the expansion of the reserves, he said. China's retail price inflation fell to a year-on-year 4.7 percent for October and officials have said they expect the figure to be about 6.3 percent for 1994 and to fall to around 6.0 percent next year. Retail price inflation rose 14.8 percent in 1995. However, the SAEC official warned that either a chronic surplus or deficit in the reserves could harm China's balance of payments.
ECAT	The Indicative Planning Council (IPC) for the Housing Industry, the Australian government's housing forecaster, on Tuesday revised up its forecast housing starts for 1996/97 to 127,000 from 124,000. The council also projected a further rise to 142,000 housing starts in the year to June 30, 1998, its first forecast for that year.   "The decline in dwelling construction activity has now slowed considerably from the rapid fall in 1995 and forward indicators suggest that a recovery is likely by the December quarter, 1996," the council said in a statement. "The upturn is expected to be relatively softer than previous upturns in the housing cycle, constrained by some remaining dwelling oversupply." The council includes representatives from industry bodies and national, state and local governments.   The council also revised its estimate for housing starts in 1995/96 to 124,550, from 123,600 in its previous outlook in July. "Underlying requirements for dwellings are estimated to average 138,000 per year up to 1999/2000," it said. "These estimates may be exceeded if recent increases in net overseas migration to Australia are sustained." -- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730

GCAT	One thousand police will be on hand at the second leg of the Italian Cup final between Vicenza and Napoli on Thursday. Police are concerned that many Napoli fans may travel north to the match without tickets. Vicenza's Menti stadium holds little more than 20,000 people and tickets have been sold out since last weekend. Both sides come into the game aware that it offers a last chance not to finish the season empty-handed. Napoli have a one-goal advantage from the first leg in Naples three weeks ago. A cup victory could represent an extra $2.5 million of revenue next season by way of participation in the Cup Winners' Cup. Victory would give the southern side their first trophy since the halcyon days of the late 1980s and early 1990s when Argentine Diego Maradona led to them to two league titles as well as to a 1989 UEFA Cup and 1987 Italian Cup win. Despite a good start to the season, Napoli narrowly avoided relegation from serie A this year and parted company with coach Luigi Simoni on acrimonious terms on the eve of the first leg of this final. "Given the way our season went it's a major achievement to have got to this final and I'm not off my head when I say that this cup could be more important than the two league titles won by Napoli", said goalkeeper Pino Taglialatela. Vicenza have guaranteed their first division survival but missed out on a possible UEFA Cup qualification. The club are currently in the hands of an official receiver following an investigation which led to the arrest last month of club president Gianni Sacchetto on fraud charges. Despite that, captain Giovanni Lopez, who missed the first leg of the final through suspension, believes his side have every chance of winning the cup. "The only thing that worries me about Napoli is their one-goal lead, as for the rest we can handle it," he said. Vicenza will be without defenders Davide Belotti and Uruguyan Gustavo Mendez, both suspended, while Uruguyan striker Marcelo Otero is injured. Napoli are without two suspended players in defender Francesco Colonesse and Brazilian midfielder Andre Cruz, while striker Alfredo Aglietti is doubtful because of injury. Teams (probable): Vicenza - Pierluigi Brivio; Fabio Viviani, Luigi Sartor, Giovanni Lopez, Massimo Beghetto; Alessandro Ianuzzi, Domenico Di Carlo, Giampiero Maini, Gabriele Ambrosetti; Roberto Murgita, Giovanni Cornacchini. Napoli - Pino Taglialatela; Roberto Ayala; Bertrand Crasson, Francesco Baldini, Mauro Milanese; Roberto Bordin, Raffaele Longo, Alain Boghossian, Fabio Pecchia; Massimiliano Esposito, Nicola Caccia.

ECAT	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Monday it had approved a third annual structural adjustment loan for Uganda, for $68 million. The loan, which will be available in two equal instalments, will be used to support Uganda's economic program in 1996 and 1997, the IMF said in a statement. Uganda's macroeconomic objectives for 1996 and 1997 are to achieve real GDP growth of seven percent, contain inflation at five percent, limit the current account deficit and increase international reserves, the statement said. "The achievement of these objectives will require tight fiscal and monetary policies," it said. Under the plan, Uganda will continue to sell off public companies through auctions and public flotation and promote wider stock ownership, the IMF said. The loan was made under IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, which aims to help for IMF members that are undertaking economic reform programs to strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth prospects. The loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent a year and are repayable over 10 years, with a 5-1/2 year grace period.

MCAT	The conventional capital markets have nearly stopped being a source of resources for Indian industry, the independent Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) said in its Monthly Review of Indian Economy on Monday. "Three-fourths of the amounts raised during May 1997 were through private placements," CMIE said. Public issues accounted for a meagre two percent of total flotations during the month, CMIE said. Interest rates on the corporate debt issues floated in May 1997 were lower than in recent past, indicating a fall in effective interest rates, the survey said. Debt issues worth 41.92 billion rupees were floated in May 1997. "This was the highest floatation seen in any month during the past two years," CMIE said. State-run mutual fund Unit Trust of India (UTI) brought down the interest rate on its MIP97-I scheme to 14 percent from 15 percent for similar schemes and the Industrial Development Bank of India issued 10.0 billion rupees bonds with a coupon of 13.5 percent. During the first two months of 1997/78 (April-March), 53.25 billion rupees were sought to be raised from the primary capital market which was nearly 78 percent higher than the 29.91 billion rupees raised during the year ago period, CMIE said. "There was clear dominance of debt over equity in the resources raised during the first two months of the year. Debt accounted for 84 percent of the total resources raised." May saw 13 private placements of debt, seeking to raise 30.0 billion rupees. The coupon rates ranged were as low as 13.5 percent for a five year paper going upto 15.75 percent. Major issuers were Industrial Development Bank of India, Indian Railway Finance Corporation and Steel Authority of India Ltd. -- Bombay newsroom +91-22-265 9000

The deal will enable fans to buy tickets to sports, theater, concert and family events directly through the Internet from Excite's entertainment, sports, My Excite, and travel channels by popularity, region and topic. "We are formalizing a relationship with Ticketmaster to make it easier for people to buy tickets from all of our Web sites," said Brett Bullington, executive vice president of Excite, which operates sites under the WebCrawler and Magellan search brands as well. Bullington said the companies would split revenues from advertising on co-branded pages on the service, but he declined to provide further financial details. Ticketmaster, which sold more than 60 million tickets last year with a gross sales value of nearly $2 billion, claims sales through its online site have risen by an average of nearly 25 percent a month since November to reach $2.5 million in May.

GCAT	Roelf Meyer, estranged ally of former South African president F.W. de Klerk, said on Wednesday he was forming a new political movement to challenge the ruling ANC and the National Party, which he quit at the weekend. "I am announcing today the establishment of a New Movement Process (NMP)," he told a news conference in Pretoria, saying he hoped the movement would grow into a party to fight the 1999 elections and change the new South Africa's political landscape. An architect of South Africa's post-apartheid politics of reconciliation, Meyer resigned on Saturday from the former ruling National Party (NP) and from parliament after a dispute with de Klerk over the party's political future. He played a crucial role in negotiating the peaceful handover of power in 1994 from white rule, but has effectively been sidelined by NP right-wingers who see him as too liberal. Meyer had wanted the party to disband before seeking to build a broad, moderate alliance to challenge President Nelson Mandela's ruling African National Congress. He said his new movement would have the role of such an alliance and would approach all sorts of people to try and become a viable political party to fight the dominant ANC. "The people of South Africa are yearning for a new politial organisation that will in fact leave the old order behind. At the moment all political parties are still of that old order," he said. "What this country needs is a successful competitor at national level. We must establish an alternative to government which can become a government of the future." Meyer said he would be tough on crime and push ahead to improve health and education for the country's poor. The ANC still enjoys the mass support it won as a liberation movement to fight the NP's apartheid regime. It won just under two-thirds of the vote in the historic all-race polls three years ago and is virtually certain of victory next time round. Its dominance of the political scene has led opponents to warn that South Africa could become a de facto one-party state. Meyer said in his efforts to prevent that, he would pursue his talks with the small white-led Democratic Party and with Bantu Holomisa, a popular politician thrown out of the ANC this year for disagreeing with its leaders. Holomisa has already formed a similar movement which he said he hopes to turn into a political party. The National Party, which won a fifth of the vote in 1994, was formed as an unashamedly white nationalist group and started implementing apartheid after winning power in 1948. Despite many efforts since the early 1990s, it has had difficulty altering its old image, especially among the blacks it is trying to woo. Most of its voters are whites or mixed-race people, many of whom who fear domination by the black majority.

ECAT	Canada will likely balance its budget by fiscal 1998-99, helped by low interest rates and healthy economic growth, Toronto-Dominion Bank economists said on Wednesday. The bank made the forecast in a report on Canadian government finances. Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin has a C$9 billion deficit target for fiscal 1998-99, although it is widely seen as too conservative. Once the federal budget deficit is eliminated, TD said the federal government may deliver a sizeable tax cut, which could take effect by 1999. "The federal and provincial governments can look forward to a lower debt service burden in the years ahead, which will permit them to offer more tax cuts, and invest in key programs", Teresa Courchene, TD senior economist said in a statement. TD said the debt burdens of Canada's federal and provincial governments were on a steady downward path. The bank predicted that by fiscal 1999-2000, the federal and provincial governments were poised to record a combined surplus for the first time in more than two decades. If federal and provincial governments ran even small surpluses, TD said the combined government debt burden could fall to about 70 percent of GDP within ten years, from its current ratio of about 100 percent. The combined federal and provincial debt is expected to top C$860 billion (US$620 billion) this year. ((Jeffrey Hodgson (416) 941-8105, e-mail: jeffrey.hodgson@reuters.com))
CCAT	High oil product stocks in Singapore has forced at least one refiner to store cargoes outside its refinery complex due to poor regional demand, traders said on Thursday. Sources said Singapore Refining Co (SRC) had shipped product, including a 30,000-tonne cargo of gas oil, to Singapore Petroleum Co's (SPC) offshore terminal at Pulau Sebarok to prevent tank tops at the SRC refinery. Other products were shipped to SRC shareholder Caltex for storage.   "All the (excess) cargoes were lifted out today. There was some hiccup there earlier. We took one cargo to Pulau Sebarok for bunker use," a source at SPC said. The high level ofproducts is pressuring middle distillates particularly, traders said. Data from Singapore's Trade Development Board showed earlier on Thursday that middle distillate stocks have risen to their highest level in at least three and a half years. The data showed stocks in the week ending June 11 rose 993,000 barrels to 11.236 million barrels, the highest level since at least January 1994.   Traders said Singapore refiners would resist the temptation to cut runs to alleviate the high storage levels. In addition, margins improved over the past few days to produce a 50-cent per barrel profit on simple processing of Middle East crudes, traders said. A basic refinery margin on Dubai showed a profit of 67 cents Wednesday and a more complex cracking margin was $2.84 in profit. Negative margins in May prompted at least one refiner, Esso Singapore, to cut runs at its 230,000 bpd refinery by 10 percent.   Traders said the high middle distillate stocks in Singapore were due to the arrival of large arbitrage cargoes from the West amid poor regional demand. "The refiners are struggling to sell their products bacause of the large amount of arbitrage cargoes still around unsold," one trader said. SRC is jointly owned by SPC, British Petroleum Co Ltd Plc and Caltex, itself a joint venture between Texaco Inc and Chevron Corp. --Singapore Newsroom (+65-870 3093)
CCAT	Sony Corp said Sunday that Sony Electronics Inc will install the infrastructure for a digital broadcast system for the CBS television network to produce the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. Larry Kaplan, senior vice president of Sony Electronics Inc's broadcast and professional services said the Olympics contract was worth "millions and millions" of dollars, but would not disclose an exact amount. The system will consist of two production studios, nine edit bays and more than 60 Sony digital recorders, the company said. Sony had been chosen by Westinghouse Electric Corp's CBS to integrate broadcast systems during the 1992 and 1994 Winter Games also, a release from Sony said.

CCAT	The Bank of France said on Thursday it made a 1996 net profit of 1.21 billion francs, compared to 1.37 billion in 1995. The central bank made a gross operating profit of 2.84 billion francs, compared to 3.23 million francs in 1995, it said in a statement. It paid tax on 1.27 billion francs of profit. The reduced profit was mainly due to lower interest rates in money market tenders. The central bank also continued a policy of provisioning started last year, it said, but gave no figure for 1996. It made provisions of 1.20 billion francs in 1995. The Bank was made independent from state control in 1994.

MCAT	Hungary's overnight rates rose to a closing of 23.625 percent on Friday from Thursday's 23.125 percent, on a market unusually lacking funds, dealers said. "When the demand for money is so strong, more than one factors must be in the background," said Sandor Tolonics of Budapest Bank. Dealers said the biggest Hungarian commercial bank OTP, which is usually a major lender, stayed away from the market on Friday while other large banks were on the borrower side. They added that the two-week reserve period only began this week and banks were filling their reserves carefully.
MCAT	U.S. West Coast crudes rose with benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI), but discounts for Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude were unchanged as players failed to strike any new deals. October WTI got a boost from reports of a large draw in U.S. crude oil stocks, which fell 3.3 million nationwide last week, a trade group reported. October WTI was pegged $24.10/24.20 a barrel. But October deliveries of ANS remained at $2.15 a barrel off WTI, with buyers holding out because of a supply glut and too many sellers.   A number of refinery outages, both planned and unplanned, were reported by traders. A gasoline-making unit at Chevron's El Segundo plant was due to come off line at the end of September, and coker and crude units at Texaco's Los Angeles refinery were due down this week, traders said. Traders said Mobil's plant at Torrance, California, was planning a crude unit outage in January. Planned maintenance on Unocal's crude unit was also scheduled for the same month. Meanwhile, Arco's Carson plant was reportedly buying distillates during the past week because of coker problems.   The shut coker could back up crude into the market, traders said. Powerine refinery in Santa Fe Springs, California, was beginning the process of starting up but no date was set for production of refined products, a company official said. The official denied an earlier report that the refinery would make products by September 21. The 47,000 barrel-per-day refinery has the capacity to make 20,000 of CARB gasoline and 10,000 bpd of CARB diesel. Kern River was quoted at discounts of around 35/25 cents to posted pricings at $15.75 a barrel. But one trader heard unconfirmed deals at parity to postings. Values for Wilmington stood at $17.00/17.20 a barrel.
MCAT	German equities treaded water at higher levels in afternoon electronic trade on Tuesday, with dealers looking around for significant new data to help the market find new direction. At 1422 GMT the IBIS DAX index stood at 3,342.96 points, up 14.55 points or 0.44 percent, stuck in the middle of a narrow trading range which saw it reach a high of 3,357.75 points and a low of 3,325.75 points. "It's all a bit drifty this afternoon. We had a busy morning with lots of corporate data, but this afternoon the index is virtually unchanged," said a Frankfurt broker.   The strongest gainer in afternoon IBIS trade was Deutsche Lufthansa AG, which was up 1.07 marks, or nearly five percent, at 23.10 marks in late trade. Dealers said that there was positive sentiment in the market on the course of the airline's privatisation programme, while other dealers said that there were technical reasons for the share's upward mobility. Also performing strongly in late electronic trade was chemical giant Hoechst AG, which was up 1.93 points, or nearly three percent, at 66.90 marks.   Dealers said that Hoechst stock had underperformed its counterparts in the chemical sector for some time, and was undergoing a delayed reaction. They said the stability of the dollar also helped. it reported a 54 percent jump in first quarter pre-tax profits to 181 million marks on sales rising almost as strongly to 1.03 billion marks. Preference shares in SAP were up 6.40 marks, a rise of 2.20 percent, at 297.50 marks, in late trade. Electronics giant Siements was also higher.   Siemens was up 1.05 marks at 90.80 marks, off earlier peaks, amid high market expectations of strong first-half 1996/97 figures when the group reports on Wednesday. The market was further underpinned by a stronger opening on the Dow Jones Industrial index, while weaker-than-expected inflation figures from North Rhine-Westphalia underpinned sentiment. -- Clifford Coonan, Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
ECAT	Canada's central bank governor switched gears on Thursday, saying the bank has moved to a more neutral strategy on monetary policy -- a sharp change from his stimulative approach of the past year. Until now, the Bank of Canada has kept monetary conditions loose by lowering key interest rates many times in the past year in hopes of stimulating the sluggish Canadian economy. But on Thursday, central bank Gov. Gordon Thiessen said the Canadian economy was poised to grow by about 4 percent in 1997 and that inflation was almost non-existent, giving the bank leeway to stop lowering rates. "What we see is a need to move from stimulative monetary conditions to a setting which is more neutral," Thiessen told a news conference after releasing the bank's semi-annual Monetary Policy Report. "Monetary policy in Canada has shifted," Michael Gregory, strategist for Lehman Brothers in Toronto, said in a phone interview. "What they're doing is removing ease. This is a sea change right now." The Canadian dollar and bond markets rallied on Thiessen's comments. In the hour after his remarks, the 30-year benchmark bond rose C13 cents to C$111.18 to yield 7.056 percent, while the Canadian dollar strengthened to C$1.3752 (72.72 cents) from Wednesday's close at C$1.3893 (71.98 cents). Canada's currency has been volatile since the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates in March and the Bank of Canada did not follow suit. With the Bank of Canada now showing a willingness to raise rates, "it allows the market to focus on our bullish fundamentals," said Rob Palombi, senior fixed-income analyst with MMS International in Toronto. Thiessen predicted more strength in the currency over the long term. While Thiessen's comments prompted immediate market predictions of rising rates in the coming months, Thiessen said any rate hike would likely be small. Although he was enthusiastic about the prospects for the Canadian economy, Thiessen said demand was well below capacity and that the size of Canada's debt compared to gross domestic product still needed to come down. The bank said slack in the Canadian economy was still significant, but was shrinking. In its report, the bank said the gap between actual production and the capacity to produce narrowed to 2.5 percent by the end of 1996, down from 3 percent earlier in the year. "Our view is it will continue to narrow ... this year and next, we believe," Thiessen said. "What we're looking for is to essentially eliminate that gap over time and to bring the economy back to a rate of full capacity utilization." Canada's high unemployment rate of 9.6 percent is linked to the slack in the economy, but there were signs employment was also improving, Thiessen said.
GCAT	From a small rented office above a discount store by a north Sydney beach, a group of party volunteers are out to reshape Australia's political landscape. Their phones ring steadily and the fax machine spews out messages of support for their leader, Pauline Hanson. On the wall is a poster of Hanson herself, wrapped in an Australian flag in a Boadicea-like pose which sums up her appeal to the country's disaffected voters. It is classic populism -- fearless Pauline will see off the invaders -- and it seems to be working. According to the latest opinion polls, "Pauline Hanson's One Nation" party has become a potent force in Australian politics less than three weeks after it was launched by the woman behind the nation's race debate which flared up last year. One poll said 10 percent of electors would vote for a Hanson candidate for the lower house of parliament and even more for seats in the Senate. Another poll said one-quarter of electors would consider voting for her party, rising to nearly 40 percent in Queensland state where until recently Hanson ran a fish-and-chip shop. Reacting to the polls, Prime Minister John Howard dismissed Hanson as a populist whose appeal would be transient. Mid-term opinion polls counted for little, he said. "It's easy to feed off unhappiness and insecurity at a time of change, but ultimately you've got to offer a rational alternative. If you can't offer it, then that support will recede," Howard said. But he would say that -- although Hanson's success could prove a valuable weapon against a hostile parliament in coming months, Howard's Liberal-National coalition could be hardest hit if her party genuinely took root. A PARTY WITHOUT A PLATFORM Despite its opinion poll support, Hanson's One Nation is not yet a proper political party. Its registration with the Australian Electoral Commission will be complicated -- more than 70 groups and individuals ranging from Aborigines to Chinese to Holocaust survivors have lodged submissions to block what they see as a racist party. It is also a party largely without policies, except for the obvious ones: stop all immigration until Australia's unemployment is solved, restrict foreign ownership, restore tariff protection and repeal a 1994 law giving Aborigines the right to claim back ancestral lands. But as its name implies, "Pauline Hanson's One Nation" does have a boss, a shrill red-headed single mother of four known to her staff as "the leader" and to her fans simply as Pauline. Hanson won international fame last year after her maiden parliamentary speech in September. After being ditched by Howard's Liberals for comments seen as racist, she won what had been considered a safe Labor seat with a massive swing. The speech itself, in which she warned Asian immigrants could swamp Australia and complained of a "reverse racism" that favoured Aborigines, went at first largely ignored. But media interest ballooned and Hanson and the "race debate" came to dominate front pages and news bulletins for weeks, attracting wide international interest and warnings from Asia that Australia could not afford to turn in on itself. THE SELLING OF PAULINE In One Nation's headquarters in Manly, a popular seaside suburb in north Sydney, Hanson's party is being organised and promoted by David Ettridge, a marketing specialist who has worked as a fundraiser for a charity helping children in Africa. Ettridge, 51, has been portrayed in the Australian press as the new power behind Hanson's throne. It was he who managed to turn the Pauline Hanson Support Movement -- her fan club -- into a fledgling political party. An approachable man with a quick sense of humour, Ettridge appears an unlikely right-wing puppet-master. His work with the charity World Vision "makes it very hard for anyone to call me a racist, to say that Pauline Hanson is associating with racists". And he is clearly on a buzz. Ettridge says the first batch of 10,000 membership applications printed up for the party have almost all been sent out and a Pauline Hanson home page on the Internet has received thousands of hits. Ettridge says the task over the next 18 months is to transform protest votes into lasting political allegiance. The party was eager to test itself in a by-election and would soon be making up a shortlist of candidates. The pollsters themselves say the polls cannot be given too much weight. Jim Alexander, chief executive of AGB-McNair -- whose poll for the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper said one in four Australians would consider voting for Hanson's party -- pointed out that 60 percent of people said they would not ultimately vote for it. Ettridge says Hanson has all it takes to become a real party leader and those who predicted earlier this year that she would fade away have been proved wrong. "At the same time that Canberra is self-destructing, with the integrity of politicians at an all-time low, Pauline is a fresh face, she speaks her mind, she identifies with mainstream Australia, and she speaks the truth," he says. A straw poll on the streets of central Sydney appeared to back him -- many passers-by attacked Hanson but others praised her for saying what she thinks while other politicians safely stick to the party line. "I have a proverb," says a Sydney florist who refused to give his name. "Show me an honest politician and I'll show you a liar. Pauline's not a politician, she's a real person."

A Henkel spokesman said no statement was planned after Loctite directors rejected its bid for control as inadequate and said they were "determined to seek to sell the company at a price that fully reflects its value." Henkel has bid $57.75 a share for the 65 percent of Loctite it does not already own. The offer was below the $59-3/4 price at which Loctite was trading late morning in New York. -- Bonn newsroom, 49-228-26097150

This is the third consecutive annual surplus for the Canadian province. Manitoba will transfer C$100 million from its Fiscal Stabilization Fund to offset federal reductions in transfer payments, Stefanson said. Otherwise, it would post a C$73 million deficit inl 1997/98. Manitoba will pay off C$75 million of its debt to bring it under C$13 billion for the first time in five years.
CCAT	German diversified industrial group Veba AG will see internal financing clearly climb in the years ahead despite higher investment, chief financial officer Hans Michael Gaul said late on Thursday. Gaul said higher internal financing would help improve the company's financial flexibility, allowing it to take advantage of strategic options. Group chairman Ulrich Hartmann said at the same event that Veba's return on equity capital would improve in 1996. "We will make another step this year toward our goal of 15 percent return on equity capital after taxes," he said. Last year, the return equity return was 11.4 percent. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
ECAT	Brazil's Ministry of Industry and Commerce has recommended setting up special credit lines to help specific sectors of the national industry restructure and cope with foreign competition, a senior official said. Antonio Sergio Martins de Mello, secretary of industrial policy at the ministry, said the aim was to boost competitiveness, but that greater protection against imports in the form of higher tariffs or other barriers was not in the cards. "We believe the best protection is increased competitiveness," Mello told Reuters.   A report by the ministry, which singles out 15 sectors for special aid, is being studied by the Finance Ministry. The recommendations follow a series of measures, such as limited credit lines and the reestablishment of an export insurance agency, designed to boost overseas sales and plug a widening trade gap, seen at up to $5.2 billion in 1996. The 15 areas identified as in need of some help are capital goods, electronics, car parts, textiles, leather and shoes, metals, chemicals, marine construction, furniture, paper and cellulose, agricultural machinery, information technology, toys, fishing and civil construction.   Several of those sectors, in particular the toy and textile industries, have already won tariff safeguards from Brasilia, leading to some concern among Brazil's international trading partners of a step back from trade liberalization. But Mello said tariff measures would only be applied in cases of unfair trading and not as an instrument to boost the fortunes of local businesses. "We are talking only about restructuring (industries) here," he said. Newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo Monday quoted the economic policy secretary of the Finance Ministry, Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros, as ruling out any "protectionist" moves. "The basic instrument of trade policy will not be tariffs, but the use of credit mechanisms and restructuring," Mendonca de Barros told the newspaper.

ECAT	The economy grew moderately in mid-summer with several regions reporting more robust activity, but there were few signs of rising prices or wage pressures, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. "Economic activity generally expanded at a moderate rate in many districts in June and July, although several reported that growth was more brisk," the central bank said in its periodic summary of economic activity. "Prices for most goods were stable, although reports indicated that lumber and some agricultural prices rose," the report, known as the Beige Book, said. The report, compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, was likely to bolster the widespread belief among investors that Fed policy-makers will hold interest rates steady when they meet on Aug. 19. The Fed raised short-term rates in March in a bid to ward off inflation, the first increase in more than two years, but has held them steady since. A survey of 33 economists by Reuters this week found that none expect the Fed to raise rates at the next meeting. The Fed said prices were stable overall and were being held in check by "competitive pressures" in much of the country, though several regions said prices were rising for agricultural and energy products. The central bank said labor markets had tightened further, with reported shortages of skilled workers, but "subdued" wage pressures. "Despite the persistent labor market tightness, wage pressures remained generally subdued," it said. Investors were rattled by a government report last Friday that unemployment fell to 4.8 percent in July, its lowest level in nearly 25 years, raising concerns about inflation. But separate government reports show wholesale prices have fallen for a record six months, while consumer prices so far this year have risen at the slowest pace since 1986. While consumer spending picked up in the June-July period, helped by summer weather, automobile sales were "slightly softer", the Fed said. "Manufacturing remained at a high level or expanded further across most industries, particularly for nonautomotive durables," it said. But most manufacturers said their inventories were at "generally desirable levels."
MCAT	Turkey's state-owned oil company Tupras has accepted offers of Iranian, Syrian and Kazakh crude for its 300,000 tonne sour crude tender, traders said on Tuesday. Official confirmation was not available but traders believed Tupras took 130,000 tonnes of Iranian Heavy and 70,000 tonnes of Syrian Light from a Swiss trader, 60,000 tonnes of Iranian Heavy from a British major and 60,000 tonnes of Tengiz crude from a major U.S. equity holder. The Iranian heavy was heard priced at $1.50 below Dated Brent, while the Syrian was believed accepted at 20 cents a barrel over the official selling price and no numbers were reported for the Tengiz barrels. The tender, which closed last Friday, was for delivery in the July 15-25 window. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 8060
MCAT	Greek shares continued to show strength on Tuesday, firming 1.9 percent to 1,684 points and around 5.6 percent from Monday's lows when the 1,600 level support level was tested. Brokers said they expected the market to continue climbing in the near-term. "The market is seen clawing its way steadily to higher levels as fresh capital is flowing into equities uninterrupted by recent volatility in international markets," said Costas Karydis, broker at D-F Securities. This sentiment should prevail until the rights issue of OTE is completed, he added. State telecoms OTE plans a large rights issue and part-flotation in June. Foreign portfolios continued to off-load large holdings in large private banks and select construction stocks on interest rate and forex jitters but domestic buying interest snapped up most of the offer. "We may see foreign portfolios continuing sales of Alpha Credit , ErgoBank and Michaniki until short-term rates and the forex market completely return to normal conditions," Karydis said. But buyers consistently outstrip sellers and prices rebound despite temporary weakness, he added. In the previous week, the equity market's foreign component was spooked by a hike in interbank rates in response to a weaker drachma. The market was seen very sensitive to short-run interbank rates which had played a key role in shaping up sentiment. "Market participants have grown very sensitive to short-term interest rates. A halt in the downward trend of interest rates appears to be a sufficient reason to reverse the favourable market sentiment," said Karydis. The Athens general index added 1.90 percent or 31.39 points to end at 1,684.38 from Monday's close at 1,652.99. It opened on a firm note at 1,673 points and set an intra-day high of 1,697.52 shortly after. Industrials led the market with a 2.93 percent rise, followed by banks which appreciated 1.28 percent. The market saw continuing good levels of turnover. Tuesday's turnover amounted to 27.2 billion drachmas on volume of 5.2 million shares, including several blocks. Advancing stocks beat decliners 124 to 91 with 28 shares unchanged on 243 traded. The Merrill Lynch call spread warrant on OTE with a strike price of 3,800 drachmas was quoted higher at 1,119-1,149. Shares of OTE telecom , the underlying, firmed 200 drachmas to 7,400 drachmas. The Merrill Lynch American call warrant on a basket of 23 Greek equities that are part of the Athens general index was quoted higher at 708.88-754.13. The warrants expire January 9 1998. The ING Baring Financial Products American style call warrant based on a basket of six bank stocks was quoted higher at $86.55-$88.24.

GCAT	A summit in Helsinki between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin will now take place March 19 and 20, the White House said Thursday. The previous dates for the summit were March 20 and 21. A White House spokesman, David Johnson, said the change was made to accommodate Clinton's visit to Copenhagen, Denmark, on March 21 after leaving the Finnish capital. "When we had our advance team discussions and in the context of adding on the stop in Denmark, we decided it would be a more effective programme to have the summit take place on the 19th and the 20th and go on to Denmark on the 21st," he said.
GCAT	War in eastern Zaire is affecting an increasingly wide area, with more people fleeing and ever greater numbers going hungry, aid workers said on Friday. Spain, one of the backers of a proposed international intervention force in Zaire, said hundreds of thousands would die of hunger before effective help arrived. Food riots hit the eastern city of Goma on Friday morning. Armed rebels fired into the air to beat back more than 1,000 hungry people trying to seize the last food in a U.N. warehouse. "I have had nothing to eat today and nothing but water yesterday," said 60-year-old Fessu Mahkenya. No food has entered Goma, which has an estimated population of about 200,000, since rebel forces seized the city late last week. Virtually all its shops and hotels have been looted. An emergency health committee in Goma appealed on Friday for agencies to intervene and supply medicine and medical equipment. Goma's last foreign aid workers fled to Rwanda last Saturday after fierce battles which killed more than 400 people. "The whole international community is called to immediate action at the highest level before it is too late," said Jean Nicholas Kasereka Busara, who heads the city's health committee. "This tragedy will become far worse unless urgent measures are taken," said the committee, adding that 300,000 Zaireans had been hit by the conflict, which entered a fourth week on Friday. A Spanish government spokesman in Madrid said hundreds of thousands would die before effective aid arrived in the region. "The plan is going to work. The U.S. and international community will send troops," said the spokesman. "But it will be too late anyhow. Now people are starving, they are dying from hunger. When these troops reach Kindu (Zaire), it will be too late. Hundreds of thousands will be dead at that time." A complex multi-sided war in eastern Zaire has cut off more than one million Rwandan refugees from the outside world and also driven more and more uprooted Zaireans to hunger. A Spanish aid worker who fled Zaire on Wednesday told a meeting in Nairobi of virtual mayhem in the east as some 175,000 refugees fled two camps after looting aid agency warehouses. U.N. officials quoted him as saying competing armed groups of Zairean soldiers, Rwandan Hutu militiamen and refugees were rampaging in the region, looting camps and Zairean villages. He said the 175,000 refugees who fled Kahindo and Katale camps headed west through wide lava fields, which emit dangerous gases, and some died from lack of food and water. "We were amazed to see some of them climb up mountains. We could see the campfires at night," said the aid worker, twice threatened with execution by former Rwandan troops. Weeks of hand-wringing by governments and aid agencies have so far produced no international consensus on what can be done. But diplomatic efforts on Friday concentrated on Rwanda, a key player because of its backing for the rebels in Zaire. U.N. special envoy Raymond Chretien on Friday started talks in the Rwandan capital Kigali with the country's leaders to seek their support for a U.N. force in eastern Zaire. "Without Rwanda's support, the whole operation could end up very, very messy or even impossible to launch," a U.N. diplomat told Reuters. The Rwandan Hutu refugees, half of them under 16, include tens of thousands of former Rwandan army troops and militiamen who fled their homeland in 1994 after the genocide of up to one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Armed Hutus, fearing death if they return to Rwanda, now guard what is left of the refugee camps in Zaire and have denied access to outsiders since an insurrection involving Tutsis and other Zaireans cut them off from foreign aid. On Thursday Zairean villagers near the huge Mugunga camp west of Goma said Rwandan Hutu fighters seized about 100 local children to use as human shields in case of a rebel advance on the camp. The food riots in Goma showed that Zaireans themselves, not just the Rwandan refugees, are caught up in a tragedy of growing proportions. Aid workers said on Friday the conflict was affecting wide stretches of the eastern Zaire borderlands and many villagers were fleeing into the bush and refugees into lava fields and up mountains. A U.N. spokeswoman in Geneva said on Friday the U.N. refugee agency had so far not received satellite photographs requested from Western states in late October to track the refugees.
CCAT	Australia's largest motoring organisation, the Sydney-based NRMA, said on Friday it was considering a plan to operate its own "superstore" used car yards which would remove haggling over prices and trade-ins. "It is wrong to suggest that this is an attack on car dealers," NRMA (National Roads and Motorists Association) chief executive Malcolm Jones said in a statement. "Buyers are already voting with their feet and over 50 percent of used car buyers currently choose to buy privately rather than from a dealer. These are the people we are looking at providing assistance to," Jones said.   NRMA, which provides roadside assistance services to stranded motorists as well as purchasing advice, said the superstore proposal was at the feasibility stage and the board was yet to make a final decision. NRMA is also a major general insurance operation. "NRMA is examining the feasibility of helping members to buy cars at a value for money price," Jones said. "A Superstore is a new trend emerging in the USA for buying vehicles as is using the Internet."   The proposal was strongly criticised by second hand car dealers quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, with one prominent dealer saying it would put 600 used car yards out of business. NRMA said a superstore would have touch-screen guides to buying a car, which would not be more than five years old, fixed prices with no bargaining, a fixed trade-in price and a return policy for unhappy customers. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
CCAT	Kuok Philippine Properties Inc said on Monday its board had agreed to infuse an additional 306.9 milion pesos in a Philippine-based real estate joint venture with Malaysia's Pelangi Bhd. Corporate secretary Cynthia Laureta told the Philippine Stock Exchange that Pelangi, which holds 40 percent of Carmona Heights Properties Inc (CHPI), would also pour in 204.6 million pesos. The new equity infusion came after CHPI increased its authorised stock to 1.6 billion pesos from the previous 1.0 billion pesos. Earlier, Kuok invested 378 million pesos, while Pelangi contributed 252 million pesos in CHPI. "The additional equity contributions of KPPI and Pelangi in CHPI will be used to fund the acquisition of land in excess of the initial targeted area of 700 hectares, which the parties have agreed to increase to a total of 1,105 hectares," the company said. - Manila newsroom 63 2 8418968 Fax 8176267
GCAT	French Communist leader Robert Hue appealed for left-wing unity at the start of his party's reform congress on Wednesday but acknowledged important differences with the Socialists, the biggest opposition party. "We want union (of the Left). Not the union of the past which leads to a dead end and failure but a new union, without hegemony, rich in its diversity," Hue told the 1,100 delegates. A central issue at the five-day congress is the Communists' attitude towards a future single European currency, which may determine whether they can join a broad left alliance with the pro-European Socialists for the 1998 general election. For the first time since the 1950s, veteran former hardline leader Georges Marchais was absent. Marchais, 76, who announced recently he would retire from the politburo at this 29th party congress, is recovering from a heart attack last week. Hue took over as Marchais' hand-picked sucessor as national secretary in 1994 but has worked hard to transform the party, which still claims 275,000 members -- a figure regarded as inflated by independent political analysts. He jettisoned the remnants of "democratic centralism" and declared that, contrary to Marchais's dictum, Soviet communism was not "globally positive". He has refocused the party to fight "ultra-liberalism" and "the predatory globalisation of financiers". The jovial, rotund Hue, a popular figure with his cropped beard and round spectacles, has succeeded in halting the Communists' electoral decline. He won 8.6 percent in last year's presidential election. An independent CSA poll published on Wednesday said nine percent of voters would cast their ballot for a Communist candidate, and another 17 percent did not rule it out. For the first time, the policy document to be approved by the congress was drafted in conjunction with grassroots party cells and the congress will vote on amendments offered by both liberals and hardliners. The key test will be the single European currency. Hue has called for a referendum before France joins monetary union, but hardliners have put down amendments condemning the euro. That would make it harder for the party to team up with the Socialists if the Left wins the 1998 general election. In his speec, Hue called on the Communists to "rise to their responsibilities" and be willing to join a Socialist-led government in 1998 on the basis of a common platform. "Important differences remain between us on the question of money and of the single currency. Above all the Socialist Party persists in its old approach of ignoring pluralism by presenting its own programme as representing "the Left'," Hue said. "Our party has a duty to participate in government to ensure the implementation of a policy of change. We consider the action of Communist elected officials -- and of possible Communist ministers -- will relay citizens' demands to France's institutions and rulers." The Communisty party had four ministers in a Socialist-led government formed by the late president Francois Mitterrand in 1981, which carried out sweeping nationalisations. It withdrew in 1984, accusing Mitterrand of betraying the Left. In a sign of the times, the general-secretary of the Communist-dominated CGT trade union, Louis Viannet, is to give up his seat on the politburo, renamed the national bureau, although he will remain on the central committee. CGT rail union leader Bernard Thibault, who led a successful rail workers' strike last year, will take his place. Dissident economist Philippe Herzog, the only senior who favours European monetary union, is also to leave the politburo.

GCAT	Five weeks after a disastrous election defeat, France's Gaullist RPR party on Sunday chose former National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin to revitalise the right and lead it back to power. Seguin won 79 percent of the ballots cast at a special congress of the conservative Rally for the Republic party, easily defeating five rival candidates in the contest to succeed the unpopular former prime minister Alain Juppe. Seguin promptly vowed to reunite and expand the right. Responding to fears he might use the party post as a stepping stone to the presidency, he pledged allegiance to Gaullist President Jacques Chirac, whose seven-year term expires in 2002. "We need a truce on grating words and petty resentments," Seguin told the congress of more than 4,000 party activists in the eastern Paris suburb of Vincennes. "This evening Jacques Chirac must know that our movement has decided on reconciliation, renewal and openness in order to better serve him," Seguin said. "To serve the president is to serve France." The rotund Seguin, 54, is a heavyweight orator who led the "no" campaign in a 1992 referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union. He has more recently said he favours the shift to the euro single currency and greater European integration. His ideology is a blend of populism and nationalism. He decided to pursue the party leadership after the right was swept from power by an alliance of Socialists, Copmmunists and Greens in a June 1 parliamentary election. Juppe, who had led the right's losing campaign, accepted responsibility for the defeat and stepped down as prime minister but initially hesitated to give up the RPR leadership post. He ultimately agreed to resign voluntarily. But in a parting shot, he thanked the congress, five years in advance, for supporting Chirac's reelection when his current seven-year presidential term ends in 2002. Following Seguin's victory, the congress was read a message from Chirac, who founded the RPR in 1976 to carry on the traditions of former president Charles de Gaulle. In his message, Chirac expressed confidence in Seguin's leadership and thanked Juppe for his past service. Juppe also pledged support for Seguin. The RPR congress was just one part of a recomposition of the defeated right, over which the weakened president, forced to yield much of his power to a left-wing government led by Socialist Lionel Jospin, has had only limited influence. Seguin has put his rhetorical talent to immediate use in attacking Prime Minister Jospin but has not yet come up with a coherent political line for the new opposition. He has also resumed weekly lunch meetings with Chirac to discuss political strategy. But Seguin has irked the head of state by cutting a deal with a party faction led by ex-prime minister Edouard Balladur, who challenged Chirac during the 1995 presidential campaign. Balladur was loudly booed when he addressed the party congress. In recognition of the strong anti-Balladur sentiment at the congress, Seguin put off his choice of a deputy party leader. The Balladurian wing of the party has pressed for him to name former budget minister Nicolas Sarkozy, who was manager of Balladur's 1995 presidential campaign.
CCAT	German chemicals group Bayer AG said it would spend a record 3.7 billion marks ($2.2 billion) on research in 1997 and said it had a good dozen drugs in development with a sales potential from 10 billion marks. Bayer chief executive Manfred Schneider told a company meeting late on Wednesday that 2.5 billion marks of the research funds were earmarked for healthcare and agriculture. Additional funds would be spent on new product development as well as on marketing efforts. Schneider said 57 percent of Bayer's research budget was spent in Germany but that amount was expected to drop in the coming years. He said, however, that Bayer was not reducing its work in Germany, where it employs 60 percent of the 14,000 people at the company involved in research. Schneider also said Bayer would introduce in the next two years two new medicines, including one against septic shock. The product pipeline for plant protection and animal healthcare products was also full, he said, noting products under development for plant protection were expected to add a minimum 500 million marks in new sales. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.688 German Marks)

CCAT	Polish insurance company Polisa SA, which expects to enter the Warsaw bourse in mid-November, aims to boost its market share by targetting the country's fast-growing number of small and medium sized enterprises. The firm's president Stanislaw Gutek told Reuters on Thursday he believed the strategy would enable Polisa to raise its market share to up to 4.5 percent in 1997 and then 10 percent in the next few years, from the current 3.7 percent. "We believe the area of small and medium-sized firms is our future, taking into account their growing number and needs ... but this doesn't mean we are not eyeing bigger clients, especially now, when our large capital lets us do so," he said. The reserve and share capital of the company, Poland's third largest insurer and which provides non-life insurance, totals 41.5 million zlotys. It reported net profit of 2.6 million zlotys on 123.1 million zlotys gross premiums in 1995. Gutek said Polisa felt strong enough not to have to eagerly hunt for an investor, but said that it might find one in the second half of 1998. Polisa would be interested in a minority investor from either inside or outside the insurance sector, which would take a 10 to 15-percent stake, he added. "We have time ... but let's say we are flirting with several foreign institutions that could boost our capital in future. We are open for Polish investors as well," he said. Gutek said Polisa was also considering taking part in a planned consolidation of Polish insurance firms. "We see some possibilities for cooperation, carrying out common policy, mergers with other firms or purchasing ailing insurers, but we have to talk about it to our shareholders before we reveal any details," he said. He added that one of these possibilities could materialise in the beginning of 1997. Gutek said Polisa did not plan to build up a holding company, but said it was entering areas which might prove profitable, such as the life insurance sector through Polisa Life SA, in which Polisa has a 26-percent stake. He said Polisa had a 37-percent stake, to be diluted to 26 percent, in Agro-Polisa, a firm which was to provide insurance to farmers and was now waiting for a finance ministry licence. "We believe the farmers' insurance market, although quite difficult because farmers are reluctant to buy any form of insurance, has a future in Poland," he said. The largest of Polisa's shareholder, BIG bank subsidiary Bel-Leasing, has a 10.9-percent stake in the firm. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700
ECAT	Bank of England Governor Eddie George strongly advised Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to raise UK interest rates by a quarter point at their January 15 monetary meeting. George said there was a good case for a half point tightening, but said the Bank would not press the case. "The Bank still thought it was likely that a monetary tightening of a half of a percent would be need fairly soon to moderate the growth of domestic demand," the minutes show him as saying.   "But the Bank did strongly recommend a quarter percent rise this month," the minutes said. While George said that the recent rally in sterling would not be sufficient to offset stronger inflationary pressure emerging in 1998, Clarke said the currency's appreciation persuaded him that interest rates did not have to rise. "The Chancellor said he did not believe that enough account had been taken of the strength of the exchange rate," the minutes said. Clarke said he could see a case for raising interest rates taking the housing market and money supply figures in isolation. But other indicators were more mixed.   George said the government's 2.5 percent inflation target would be put increasingly at risk in the course of the next year despite the further strengthening of sterling and the lack of any immediate signs of inflationary pressure at the producer stage. He also noted broad money supply growth had risen further since the summer. "That was very unlikely to be compatable with the inflation target in the medium term". But Clarke said there were some signs domestic demand may have eased. "Although consumption was still strong, early indicators from the December CBI distributive trades survey and the British Retail Consortium suggested that the rate of growth may have eased off somewhat," the minutes quoted Clarke as saying. -- Kate Kelland +44 171 542 7715

MCAT	CME live cattle futures closed sharply higher as the market resumed its recent uptrend after a short-lived downside correction, dealers said. Prices had been lower early but recovered to little changed levels with R.B. and H. Financial Services a noted buyer of August, and stops were triggered as the market moved into positive territory, floor sources said. "We hit stops and then we had a lot of technical type buying," one floor trader said. R.J. O'Brien was also a featured buyer of August and Iowa Grain of October. Cargill Investor Services sold October late, dealers said. They noted active trade in the cash market at $64.00 per cwt, steady with the bulk of trade last week. There was some concern earlier in the day that feedlots might be prepared to accept a lower $63.00 but it evaporated as the run-up in futures gathered momentum. August live cattle closed 0.925 cent up at 66.700 cents, just below the day's high of 66.825 cents. August set a contract high last week of 66.900 cents. Feeder cattle futures also closed up sharply, boosted partly by spillover buying from the live cattle pit.   Dealers said ADM Investor Services were among buyers of August feeders, Saul Stone was a noted seller and R.J. O'Brien was on both sides. August feeders closed 0.600 cent higher at 82.675 cents a lb after peaking at 83.200 cents. Last week the front month set a contract high of 83.400 cents. Other months ended up 0.600 to 0.125 cents. September buyers included ABN-AMRO Chicago Corp, LIT and Saul Stone with Lind Waldock and Cargill Investor Services among sellers. Dealers noted the latest CME feeder index, for July 22, was off $0.05 per cwt at $81.99. In feeder cattle options ADM Investor Services were a seller of September calls with a strike price of 82 cents. Boneless beef futures saw active interest in buying August and selling October. August closed up 0.80 cents at 98.00 cents a lb with October off 0.10 at 97.00 cents. August trimmings ended steady at 49.30 cents a lb. ((Nigel Hunt 312-408 8720))

ECAT	New Zealand economic activity has been crunched, particularly the tradeables sector, but the worst is over, the National Bank of New Zealand said in its December economic forecasts on Monday. It forecast the New Zealand economic cycle would bottom at 1.5 percent growth in 1997, something it said was a remarkable performance, but then would grow between 3.0 and 3.5 percent in 1998 and 1999.   The bank said the deferral of tax cuts to 1998 from 1997 by the new coalition government would have mimimal impact on aggregate growth in the short-term but would reduce household income growth. The deferral would also be more inflationary, meaning interest rates and the exchange rate would be higher than they would otherwise be. National predicted spending would surge in 1997 with major projects planned in the utilities, wood, paper and the food sectors.   It said the external account would be an area of concern with a rising invisible deficit pushing the current account deficit towards five percent of GDP by 1999. Inflation is picked to have peaked at its current rate of 2.3 percent and was poised to slow to 1.0 percent in 1998 before swinging up again in 1998. Short-term interest rates are forecast to fall to 7.5-8.0 percent in the first half of 1997 while long-term rates are seen falling into a 6.5-7.0 percent band in 1997.   But the declining trend in interest rates will reverse in the first half of 1998 as inflation and monetary pressures are exerted. The bank said there is room for the exchange rate to ease modestly in 1997 "but not by the 10-15 percent many are touting". It picks the trade-weighted currency index to be flat in 1997 and appreciate 1.5 percent in 1998. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746
GCAT	Not too many countries issue commemorative telephone cards to mark World Cup qualifiers -- but Malta have done just that before their group six game against the Faroes Islands on Wednesday. It was issued as part of the drive to get the Maltese public behind their team for what is a crucial qualifier for both countries. Not that it will have the slighest bearing on a place in the finals in France next year -- but because it may determine who will end up with the wooden spoon at the bottom of the group. For the two teams go into the match having lost all 11 qualifers they have played between them, scoring five goals and conceding 49. So plenty of pride will be at stake when the two tiny island nations meet at at the Ta'Qali stadium. Malta are currently bottom of the group having lost all six matches with a goal tally of 0-27 while the Faroes record is not much better -- in fact it is almost as as bad -- played five, lost five scored five, conceded 22. If they can't work out which team is the least worst on Wednesday, they meet again in the Faroes on June 8. Ticket prices have been slashed in a bid to revive flagging public support, and state telephone company Telemalta has issued the commemorative phone card with a picture of the Maltese team "We are expecting a win. The Faroes are not inferior to us, but they are certainly not better either," said Joe Mifsud, a senior UEFA official and the president of the Malta Football Association. Maltese national coach Milorad Kosanovic, a Yugoslav, said there was plenty of enthusiasm in his squad. Buoyed by the news on Tuesday that his only doubt, skipper Silvio Vella had passed a fitness test after being injured in training, Kosanovic said he was looking forward to this match. His team would be especially careful of the Faroes one potent weapon -- their swift counter-attacks. Faroe Islands coach, former Denmark midfielder Allan Simonsen was more philosophical, saying when he arrived in Malta on Sunday that he preferred playing against top teams because that was the only way soccer could improve. "Our nation is a cluster of islands and it is difficult for the players to train together except for a few days before each match," he said. Malta go into the game after losing 6-0 to Yugoslavia, 6-0 to the Czech Republic, 6-0 and 2-0 to Slovakia and 3-0 and 4-0 to Spain. The Faroes have lost 3-1 and 8-1 to Yugoslavia, 2-1 and 3-0 to Slovakia and 6-2 to Spain. All that matters now is avoiding bottom place when the qualifiers end in October.
ECAT	Malaysia's broad monetary aggregate, M3, expanded by 22.7 percent year-on-year in 1996 against 22.3 percent in 1995, the central Bank Negara said in its annual report for 1996 on Friday. During the year itself, the M3 aggregate fell sharply due to a tightening of monetary policy. "M3 growth ended the year with 22.7 percent from a high of 27 percent at the end of March and April," the annual report said. Similarly, M2 growth moderated to 20.9 percent from a peak of 27.9 percent at the end of April, 1996, and 24 percent in 1995. However, M1 expanded at a faster 18.3 percent in 1996 against 11.7 percent in the previous year. "This is a rate (of M3 increase) we would feel uncomfortable with, particularly since it came from credit growth," said a spokesperson of Bank Negara at the annual report presentation. "We would be more comfortable if it is below 20 percent, but we don't do monetary targetting," she said. -- Kuala Lumpur newsroom (603-230 8911)
MCAT	U.S. gasoline prices jumped higher Tuesday on brisk buying interest in the spot market and the NYMEX rally. Distillate prices, however, showed little movement, as ample supplies kept differentials nearly flat for the day. On the NYMEX, August gasoline jumped 0.98 cent to settle at 58.92 cents a gallon and August heating oil firmed 0.22 cent to end at 53.00 cents a gallon. U.S. GULF Continued steady refiner buying interest buoyed conventional M1 gasoline differentials, according to traders, in the wake of Monday's pipeline scheduling deadline. Prompt regular conventional M1 gasoline changed hands as high as 0.75 cents under the August NYMEX price, up about 0.75 cent from late Monday levels, before slipping back to between about 0.90 and 1.15 cents under the futures by the end of the day. "It's worked its way back down now, but there was some good refiner buying in there today," according to one Gulf Coast trader. Barrels that hit a Colonial Pipeline scheduling deadline Monday evening reportedly traded on an upline basis at 0.25 cent under the August futures, traders said. NEW YORK HARBOR Conventional M2 gasoline differentials also gained, with prompt barrels talked between 2.00 and 2.20 cents under the August NYMEX, a gain of about 0.25 cents from Monday. "There's nothing coming in on the cargo side till the second half of the month," one trader said, which has forced buyers to chase prices up. Cargoes from Europe remained scarce, according to players, with only a handful of deals seen done in the past week. One 60-tonne gasoline cargo reached the U.S. East Coast recently, while another headed to Aruba, traders said. Two small cargoes from France also reached the U.S. in the past several days. MIDCONTINENT There was little news in the Midcontinent markets Tuesday afternoon although trade was fairly active for Group Three high sulphur and regular unleaded gasoline. Differentials for prompt unleaded barrels in the hub firmed about a quarter cent to 1.75 to 2.15 cents a gallon over August NYMEX futures amid demand. Traders said several players found themselves short and jumped into the market. Barrels for delivery by Friday were done at 2.15 cents over the print. High sulphur diesel differentials also firmed by about a quarter cent on short covering to deals done at 0.25 cents below August heating oil futures. Low sulphur diesel held steady 1.75 to 2.00 cents over the print. In Chicago, activity was reported quiet. Prompt unleaded gasoline differentials remained stable at 1.75/2.00 cents over the print.

GCAT	The top prosecutor of Honduras said on Wednesday that his country is a haven for money laundering. "In Honduras it's easy to launder money, the system allows it," Edmundo Orellana told reporters. "It's permitted because there is no law in Honduras that obligates a Honduran to explain the origin of his wealth." Honduran authorities estimate that $300 million in illegal drug profits is laundered through the country each year. Money laundering is not classified as an offence in Honduras, although legislators have been working on a bill to outlaw it since last year.
GCAT	Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hizbollah claimed responsibility for Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel which wounded at least one civilian and caused some damage early on Tuesday. "The Islamic Resistance declares openly that it shelled the settlements in north occupied Palestine with a number of Katyusha rockets, causing many casualties," a Hizbollah (Party of God) spokesman told Reuters. Dozens of Katyusha rockets fired from Lebanon slammed into northern Israel early on Tuesday, wounding at least one civilian and causing some damage, witnesses said. The attack just after 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) occurred a day after violence in Lebanon, some of it involving pro-Israeli militia, killed at least nine civilians. Timor Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL), told Reuters that about 80 Katyusha rockets were fired from several locations in south Lebanon and some had landed in northern Israel.

CCAT	Investment house Williams de Broe said on Thursday that it has bought 14 percent of one of the leading dairy products firms in the Baltic state of Lithuania, Rokisku Cheese. Williams de Broe Baltic equities chief Petri Karjalainen said Rokisku was the leading cheese maker in the Baltics and Russia. He would not reveal the price of the shares. "We are very excited with its prospects for exports for its cheese products, which are first class," he told Reuters. He said the company hoped to export to the other Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia, Russia and the United States. The company was formed in 1964, privatised in 1991-93 and was now 100 percent privately-owned. The other investors in the company are all local Lithuanians, Karjalainen added. He said the Williams de Broe investment would give the company a tax break as any foreign investment over two million dollars earned tax privileges in Lithuania. Williams de Broe last year bought a stake in Estonian drugs firm Tallinn Pharmaceutical and is active in all the Baltic stock markets. -- Riga Newsroom, +371 721 5240
CCAT	Italy's Fiat said results for the first 10 months of 1996 were in line with its most recent forecasts, according to a company note issued after a group board meeting on Tuesday. Fiat has spoken of a difficult 1996 and its latest results for the nine months from January to September showed a pretax profit falling to 1.759 trillion lire from 2.743 trillion lire. But Fiat has said its fourth quarter will benefit from the sale of fund management arm Prime and the flotation of its stake in its farm machinery group New Holland. The statement added that Fiat is preparing to open at the end of this week new factories in Argentina and India. The Argentine plant will produce a booted version of Fiat's Palio "world" car already built in Brazil and, in India, it will see the opening of a Iveco-Hinduja joint venture plant for trucks. -- Milan newsroom +392 66129502
GCAT	It is a hot, steamy Asian night and a young girl waits seductively in the doorway. The image is commonly found in leaflets selling sex tours in third world countries. The other half of that image appears in court. Last month, 44-year-old Steven Roy Mitchell of Walton-on-Thames, England was pictured in newspapers clasping a Bible as he went to jail for 17 years. Mitchell was convicted by a Manila court of having sex with two brothers, aged eight and four. Mitchell's conviction is one of a couple of recent cases that have stunned the Philippines' sex industry, which thrived by telling customers there was no fear of reprisals. "May this decision be a warning to all foreign tourists who come to the Philippines that this country can no longer be made their 'playground' for illegal activities, like paedophilia and child abuse," the judgement on the Mitchell case said. The government's recent crackdown against paedophiles has gained international support, with London's Scotland Yard sending two experts to train the Philippine police. The two-week course held last month taught detectives how to investigate a case in a way that would secure a conviction. "I investigated no less than 50 cases (of paedophilia) since 1982 of which only 10 went to court, and they are all pending there," said Mamerto Espartero, the Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation's senior agent for Metro Manila. Espartero, who took part in the Scotland Yard course, said that until recently most paedophilia cases got bogged down because the evidence was insufficient. "Often child victims do not want to testify because usually the violators are relatives or neighbours," he said. Poverty, the reason why many children turn to prostitution, also hampers investigation as often parents are paid for their silence, he said. The new drive against paedophiles is bringing various government departments together. At the Scotland Yard course, detectives trained along with prosecutors, immigration officials and doctors. "Working together like this is going to be our biggest advantage in our fight against paedophiles," said Bernadette Madrid, head of the Child Protection Unit at the Philippine General Hospital. A joint effort would mean doctors providing crucial evidence like X-rays of damage to the genitals. Prosecutors would advise police on flaws in the evidence-building and immigration officials would watch for offenders trying to run away. Mitchell's imprisonment was the second case involving a foreigner convicted of a paedophilia crime in the Philippines. In May, Australian businessman Keith Fitzgerald was jailed for up to 17 years for paying a 12-year-old girl to have sex with him. "(But) you must not just be looking for the paedophile being a foreigner," was the advice given by detective Sharon Stimpson, one of the trainers at the course. "It could be people who are living here who are in positions of trust. The best way of combating it is to believe what the child says even if it's somebody very surprising who the finger is being pointed at," she said. Stimpson said the Philippines' drive against sexual abuse of children would mean law enforcement would get "proactive," that they would go out and look for paedophiles rather than wait for victims to come and complain. Philippine police say an active hunt for child abusers is definitely on the cards now that the government has approved the formation of a special cell to fight paedophiles. If that happens, the results could be surprising. End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism (ECPAT), an organisation fighting paedophilia, says the crime is more widespread than is known. It has published a book that says the popular image of a child sex abuser as a nasty character is far from the mark. "Most long-term, persistently offending paedophiles are men who have been regarded as model citizens, somewhat conservative in their dress, their religion and their politics," it said.

MCAT	Dealers said the most direct comparison for today's deal was the 10-year bond Argentina issued in March at 475 b.p. over Bunds which has since tightened to 410 b.p. over. Only Argentina's small, illiquid September 2003 deal was in line with today's spread, they aded. A syndicate manager at CSFB countered: "Argentina has got an unparalleled franchise in the mark sector. They've established a curve this year and have a following in Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux." DMG reported good initial response from its regular outlets for Argentina paper.   Last week Argentina tapped international markets with a 600 billion lire 10-year financing and a 50 billion yen six-year Samurai transaction. The deals came after comments in early November by Argentine finance secretary Pablo Guidotti that it was considering issuing up to $2.0 billion in bonds this year to finance 1997 spending. Argentina is rated B1 by Moody's Investors Service and BB- by Standard & Poor's Corp. Union Bank of Switzerland launched a subordinated 250 million stg 10-year bond 39 b.p. over gilts.

CCAT	Taiwan's financial shares, led by the "big three" state-run banks, surged at mid-morning on Monday as the sector left electronics its wake as the market's trendsetting sector, brokers said. After 75 minutes, at 0215 GMT, financials were up 4.99 percent, while the overall index was up 1.02 percent -- and the electronics was down 4.73 percent on profit-taking. The big three state banks -- Chang Hwa Bank, First Commercial Bank and Hua Nan Bank -- all were up the daily seven percent limit to T$133, T$134.5 and T$135, respectively.   "Sentiment is quite bullish," said Golden Securities analyst Albert Lin. "Though electronics are suffering a correction, financials have emerged to lead the overall upward momentum." Lin said buying focus had turned to financials as the sector had been consolidating in recent weeks during a dazzling bull run by electronics that led the overall index sharply higher. Brokers said they expected the big three banks' planned privatisation to accelerate now that the constitutional assembly has completed amendments that will all but phase out their principal owner -- the Taiwan provincial government.   In late May, the government announced a 12-18 month plan to release 15.9 percent of First Commercial's shares, 7.5 percent of Hua Nan's and 4.65 percent of Chang Hwa's. After the offer, the government stakes in the big three would drop to below 50 percent, with the bulk of shares falling into private hands. "Now that the constitutional reform is completed, many think the government will speed up the privatisation of the big three banks, a move that will increase operational efficiency of the three banks in the long term," Lin said. -- Taipei newsroom (886-2-5080815)
CCAT	South Korea's Ssangyong is to export 1.8 million barrels of gasoline to oil giant Saudi Arabia, but traders on Friday said this was no panacea for the oversupplied Asian market. Analysts estimate the exports will only soak up part of Asia's surplus production. "At least some cargoes will move out of Asia so there will be less pressure," a gasoline trader said. "But I don't think it will have a major impact with the market so depresssed."   The Hawaii-based energy group East-West Centre estimated that Asia production would produce a 75,000 barrels-per-day surplus (bpd) in 1997. South Korea's Ssangyong Oil Refining Co said Friday it would export the gasoline to Saudi Aramco over six months from this July. Aramco, the world's largest oil company in terms of reserves, has a 35-percent share in the 443,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) South Korean refinery and provides the bulk of Ssangyong's crude requirements.   "We have had a close relationship with Aramco since 1991 and this deal won't change much but will help sustain our relationship," said a spokesman for Ssangyong. He also said the agreement was Ssangyong's first long-term contract to export gasoline as well as its first gasoline term sale to an oil-producing country. For Saudi Arabia, the deal will help it relieve an imbalance in its production of gasoline. Most Saudi Arabian demand is in the capital Riyadh and the populous Eastern Province, but most production is on its western seaboard.   Aramco has a $3 billion plan to upgrade its major oil refineries to keep pace with soaring domestic demand, but imports can make economic sense. The kingdom's population of 17 million consumes some 200,000-220,000-bpd of gasoline but demand is expected to rise to 260,000-bpd by the end of the decade. Aramco regularly imports gasoline from its Gulf neighbour Bahrain, but has also sourced some requirements from Asia, industry sources said. "It will buy what is cheap and close," a trader said.   Gasoline has gradually been drifting out of Asia because of the surplus production, mainly from Thailand and Korea. It has been supplied as far afield as Africa, Australia and the U.S. West coast. In April, South Korean refiner LG-Caltex, a joint-venture between the LG-Group  and the U.S.'s Caltex made its first sale to the Middle East, selling a cargo to Aramco. South Korea gasoline exports were boosted to up to 1.5 million barrels per month in April when Ssangyong started up its 50,000-bpd residue fluid catalytic cracker (RFCC).   After its deal with Aramco, Ssangyong which normally has one to two 300,000-barrel cargoes available for export each month, may disappear from the spot market, a trader said. "It depends on domestic demand," he said. South Korea has been absent from the spot market during the summer months and is not expected to re-emerge until September. --Singapore newsroom (+65-870-3086) With Contributions from Jean Yoon in Seoul
ECAT	Czech consumer inflation continued its gradual downtrend in January, but analysts said they do not expect a loosening of the central bank's tight monetary policy in the short-term. The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday said January inflation, month-on-month, was 1.2 percent, putting the year-on-year rate at 7.4 percent, down from 8.6 percent the previous month. The key sliding average inflation figure, which uses 1993 as a base, edged down to 8.7 percent from 8.8 percent in December, and was down from 9.1 percent in January 1996. "The January number is very good, about one percentage point lower than a year ago," Kamil Janacek, cheif economist at Komercni Banka told Reuters. "If prices and some deregulations develop accoridng to plan in the next months, and thanks to producer prices being under five percent...there is a high probability that 1997 inflation could end at around, or just under, eight percent," he added. The CSU said in a report that the biggest influences on the January inflation rate were food, drinks and tobacco products which rose 1.3 percent in the month, transportation which rose 3.6 percent and housing which rose by 1.3 percent. It added that of the 1.2 percent month-on-month rate, seasonal influences accounted for 0.23 percent, putting the seasonally-adjusted monthly rate at 0.97 percent. CSU figures show price deregulation influenced the seasonally-adjusted rate by 0.63 percent, while seasonally-adjusted core inflation was 0.34 percent. Despite the downtrend, most analysts agreed that there seems little chance the Czech National Bank (CNB), the central bank, will ease its tight monetary policy in the near future despite the sustained downtrend in CPI. Curbing inflation has been at the heart of almost all of the CNB's policies, and both CNB and government officials have said they expect rates to remain high, at least over the near term. "The month-on-month rate appears favourable," Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings, said. "While there may be some room for it, I doubt the central bank will lower rates immediately -- maybe in the second quarter at the earliest," he added. Last summer the CNB raised its key discount rate one percentage point to 10.5 percent, and hiked minimum reserve requirements to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent of deposits to squeeze off surging domestic demand. The moves have appeared to signficantly slow growth in the money supply, which is now at the lower end of the central bank's 13 to 17 percent growth target. But central bank officials have warned that wage growth -- which was up 21.2 percent in nominal terms in December according to preliminary figures -- and its influence on inflation is a growing concern. "The government has to somehow limit wage growth. It's just too high and this must be addressed before the central bank will move rates," said one London-based economist. Foreign exchange traders said the crown was unaffected by January's CPI figures since they were in line with forecasts. The crown was fixed by the central bank on Monday at 5.28 percent above its dollar/mark basket midpoint, slightly stronger than its +5.14 percent fixing from last Friday. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003
CCAT	The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) will vote next month whether to allow all customers to choose their electricity supplier as of 1998, or to retain the existing phase-in plan, a commissioner advisor said Tuesday. A draft proposal before the commission calls for abandoning plans to phase in open access over as many as five years in order to offset the market power of existing monopoly utilities. State legislation passed last year called for all California customers to be able to choose their electricity supplier no later than January 1, 2002. At a regular meeting on Tuesday the CPUC decided to hold the proposed decision until April 9, so that comments can be filed through March 21. The state's three major investor-owned utilities, Edison International's Southern California Edison Co, PG&E Corp's Pacific Gas & Electric Co, and Enova Corp's San Diego Gas & Electric Co have argued for the phase-in plan based on practical and commercial logistics. The CPUC is scheduled to vote on the change April 9. ((--D Beasley, Los Angeles bureau + 1 213 955 6761))

MCAT	Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 rubber prices were generally stable on Friday but traders were cautious following the government's decision to float the rupiah, traders said. "Traders are generally cautious because we seem to be losing direction. We are still closely monitoring developments in the currency while buyers are expected to put pressure on the price," said one trader in Palembang, South Sumatra. The rupiah fell to a new low of 2,890 against the dollar in early trading on Friday. One foreign bank dealer said an easing of overnight rates to 30 percent from 125 percent prompted some dollar buying, triggering other operators to cut short dollar positions. Some rubber traders said buying interest seemed to be zero. "Buyers seem to have launched their attack on the prices. Buying interest has been zero in the past few days, which is widely interpreted as their tactic to ask for cheaper prices," said one trader. "Many traders just do not have any idea on how much cheaper they can sell rubber," he said. Traders said SIR20 was on offer at 42.20 U.S. cents/lb fob Palembang for October shipment, 42.00 fob Pontianak and Jambi, 42.75 fob Medan, 42.50 fob Surabaya and 42.375 fob Padang. Traders said the current drought had started to have an impact on a number of rubber plantations. "In South Sumatra, for instance, it has not rained for three months, which caused many rivers to dry up," said one trader. "The drought has also affected the flow of latex. Some people are holding the raw material, either because of the drought or because of the uncertainty in the currency," he said. Other traders said transport had become expensive in a number of places because river transport was ruled out in the wake of low water levels. The official Antara news agency reported on Friday the government planned to seed clouds in September and October in order to induce rain. The agency said the rain-making efforts would be carried out in Java and part of Sumatra island, adding that the artificial rain would ease the impact of the current drought, which is expected to affect rice-producing areas. -- Lewa Pardomuan (6221) 384-6364; Fax (6221) 344-8404 -- E-mail: jakarta.newsroom@reuters.com
ECAT	Russian Economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin said on Tuesday he hoped the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would not delay payment of the next tranche of a $10 billion loan, saying to do so would be "very unjust." "I don't want that to happen. I think that would be unjust. If we take as a base the formal requirements it is clear that this is possible, but in the situation which Russia is in I think it would be a very unjust thing," Yasin told Reuters during a visit to Milan. Asked whether he was confident that the IMF would not delay payment, he said, "I am confident." Yasin, speaking through an interpreter after inaugurating a Milan centre for the promotion of investment in Russia, said the current IMF talks were very tough. An IMF mission arrived in Moscow last Wednesday for talks expected to last about a week. Sources close to the discussions said on Monday that the IMF was worried about low Russian tax collection. Asked how the talks had kicked off, he said "things are still very difficult. Russia can't collect taxes as it should and if it can't collect enough taxes, there will be problems with the budget...and there are problems." Tax revenues totalled a low 2.2 trillion roubles in cash in the first nine days of October. Overall tax receipts are about 40 percent below targeted levels. The IMF had delayed payment of one of the summer tranches of the loan because of tax shortfall worries but later released that $300 million tranche. "The Russian government has undertaken a series of extraordinary measures to collect taxes but unfortunately there are no results yet," Yasin said. Yasin said it was too early to predict the outcome of the IMF deliberations or to say what measures would be taken to change the 1997 draft budget which has been rejected by the Duma lower house of parliament. The 1997 draft budget provides for a 3.3 percent deficit of GDP compared with 3.85 percent in 1996. The Russian budget deficit was 9.2 trillion roubles in September, or 3.8 percent of GDP under the methods the IMF uses to calculate the gap, finance ministry data showed. The September figure compares with a 5.3 percent deficit IMF target for the whole of 1996. "This budget deficit will not grow," Yasin said. He said last week that stepping up borrowing would disrupt the entire process of resuming economic growth and restoring Russia's economy.
MCAT	Shanghai soybean futures ended mixed on Thursday on uncertainty about the short-term market trend, traders said. The key November 1997 contract ended at an intraday low of 3,288 yuan ($397) per tonne, losing 11 yuan. It opened at a high of 3,300 yuan per tonne. July rose 103 to 3,260, September five to 3,258, the January 1998 contract fell 64 to 3,236 and March put on five to 3,300 yuan per tonne. Combined volume rose to 26,800 tonnes from 14,800 tonnes.   "Longs and shorts fought intensely around the 3,300 yuan level today but soybeans met strong resistance above that level," one trader said. "A lack of speculative money will keep the long position holders weak in the long run," he said. Traders said they expected soybeans to consolidate around current levels on Friday.

CCAT	Standard & Poor's said on Tuesday it rated a $1.0 billion Euro medium term note programme by NV Energieproduktiebedrijf UNA at AA long-term and the outlook on the rating was stable.   "The rating reflects UNA's stable operating and financial profile as one of the four principal electricity generating companies in the Netherlands, the company's manageable capital expenditure programme, and the limited exposure to commercial risks entailed by the current Netherlands electricity supply industry structure," S&P said in a statement. But it added, "UNA faces some uncertainty regarding the future structure of the Dutch electricity market." UNA shows relatively high financial leverage but cash flow interest cover remains adequate, S&P said, and UNA's financial profile is expected to strengthen over two to three years.   S&P said competition from self-generation, independent power producers and import power sources would put presure on the Dutch generating sector in the years ahead. "UNA's efficiency, ownership ties and incumbent position in the sector will help the company adapt to these pressures," the agency said. S&P will monitor parliamentary discussions on sector restructuring as they evolve in 1996, it said. --International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 6784

CCAT	Stock in MCI Communications Corp was six percent higher on Friday on renewed rumors that either GTE Corp or British Telecommunications Plc was to buy the company. None of the companies would comment, citing policy on market speculation. MCI stock was 1-1/2 firmer at 26-5/8 at 1200 EST/1700 GMT and topped the Nasdaq actives list. "I've heard this GTE rumor before and it doesn't make sense," said analyst Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. He said GTE is already offering long distance to its own customers and does not want to buy MCI's customer base.   Analysts see more logic to the BT side of the rumor, as the British carrier already has a 20 percent stake in MCI and the two companies share Concert, a joint venture serving multinational corporations' communications needs. However, BT is blocked from increasing its MCI stake very far by a federal rule on foreign ownership of U.S. telecommunications and media assets, they said. "I don't think you can get around rule 310 B however you do it," Klugman said of the 1934 legislation that bars a higher stake.   -- Nick Louth, New York Newsroom 212 859 1712

"I don't think the negotiations will take place," the 34-year-old rebel colonel said from his base near the southern town of Kurgan Tyube. But a spokesman in Dushanbe for the predominantly Russian peacekeeping force in the central Asian republic told Reuters that no talks had been scheduled. Kalininabad, some 120 km (80 miles) south of the capital Dushanbe, is close to Khudoyberdyev's headquarters. He did not say whether there had been any casualties in the air raid. The commander of an elite government armoured brigade who has mutinied twice before, Khudoyberdyev moved his armour towards Dushanbe at the weekend in the wake of heavy fighting between two warlords in the Tajik capital. He lost a strategically important aluminium smelter west of Dushanbe to Rakhmonov's guard on Monday. An armed standoff ensued and continued on Tuesday. Khudoyberdyev said he was ready to return to barracks if the presidential guard did the same. "I agree to peace talks and I want peace in Tajikistan," he said. "If the presidential guard go back to barracks, my forces will return to Kurgan Tyube". Reporters were not allowed past a government checkpoint five km (3 miles) south of Dushanbe. A senior interior ministry official at the post said it had been quiet overnight around the contested town of Fakhrobad, about 30 km (20 miles) south of Dushanbe, and that fighting had not yet resumed on Tuesday. Khudoyberdyev, regarded by Western diplomats as politically ambitious, has not revealed his goals. "I'm not trying to move on Dushanbe," Khudoyberdyev said. "Government forces provoked us by moving toward Kurgan Tyube -- we had to defend ourselves". The outbreak of fighting has no connection with Tajikistan's armed Islamic opposition, with whom the government signed a peace accord in June aimed at putting an end to four years of civil war. War and instability in Tajikistan, a mountainous country of 5.7 million people, has carved the republic into fiefdoms under the control of maverick armed groups much like those in neighbouring Afghanistan. On Sunday, Rakhmonov issued a three-day ultimatum to  Khudoyberdyev to lay down his arms or face "destruction".
GCAT	New Zealand were poised for certain victory over Pakistan after another remarkable performance on the third day of the first test on Saturday. Chasing a victory target of 276 with more than two days to spare, Pakistan had slumped to a miserable 46 for five after losing skipper Saeed Anwar on the second ball of their second innings. At stumps, Salim Malik was on 15 and debutant Mohammad Wasim was on nought when play was halted seven overs early due to poor light. Pace bowler Simon Doull, the chief destroyer in the first innings, was again the tormentor, claiming Anwar and Ijaz Ahmad in the space of five balls. Anwar was trapped leg before the wicket, the 15th batsmen to be dismissed in this way in the match so far, two short of the world record lbw dismissals of 17 at Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, when Pakistan played the West Indies in the 1993/94 series. Ijaz, like his captain, also fell cheaply for the second time when he exposed his leg stump after scoring only eight. Inzamamul Haq was third out at 25, caught smartly by Bryan Young at second slip off Chris Cairns for 14, and a run later Pakistan lost their fourth wicket when nightwatchman Saqlain Mushtaq was removed by Justin Vaughan. New Zealand then capped off a magnificent day with their fifth wicket of opener Zahoor Elahi, who was taken low down by Young off off-spinner Dipak Patel for eight. New Zealand have won in Pakistan only re,  when Graham Dowling's side triumphed at Lahore by five wickets in 1969. The visiting side owed their second innings total of 311 to the brilliant knocks of 92 and 93 by Stephen Fleming and Cairns after resuming at 88 for five. The two Canterbury batsmen shared a sixth-wicket stand of 141 in 34.3 overs to put their side in a strong position. Cairns, dropped at seven by Inzamam off leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmad, rode his luck to smash a sparkling 93 off 89 balls, slamming 12 fours and three sixes. The left-handed Fleming was stranded at 92 after last man Doull was stumped for 26. The two added 48 runs for the last wicket to prolong Pakistan's agony. Fleming, overnight on 12, batted with great assurance and hit 13 fours and a six in his stay spanning 281 minutes and 197 balls. Fleming and Cairns led the fine recovery after Nathan Astle had fallen at his overnight three and Mark Greatbatch's stumps wred by Waqar Younis. Mushtaq who caused a minor middle collapse in which Chris Harris, Lee Germon and Dipak Patel fell quickly, finished with six for 84 for a match bag of 10 for 143, the second 10-wicket haul of his career.
CCAT	Shares in British alarm and emergency communication systems firm Tunstall Group were marked down on Thursday after weaker-than-expected full year results were released. At 1150 GMT the share price was quoted at 261p -- down 32-1/2p -- but no stock had been traded. Tunstall's preliminary results statement for the year to September 30 showed pre-tax profits static at 8.2 million stg while turnover increased to 78.0 million stg from 60.7 million. The figures disappointed analysts who had forecast pre-tax profits of 8.4 million stg on average.   Tunstall chairman Michael Dawson blamed lacklustre performance on anticipated orders not materialising and a lapse in control of overheads and margins which, he said, had now been rectified. --Catherine Bremer, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
MCAT	The following is a direct contribution from commodity statistician F.O. Licht in Ratzeburg, Germany. Please address any queries to Helmut Ahlfeld on +00 49 4541 88920. COFFEE - World market for May 15, 1997 Robusta futures in London closed sharply higher in late Thursday trading, lifting bench mark July to a new one-year high on renewed fund buying. May closed $65 higher at $1,875 per tonne, while July added $63 to close at $1,933 per tonne. The market has become extremely nervous ahead of the Brazilian frost season as inventories in both consuming and producing countries are near 20 year lows. Any sign of cold weather in top-grower Brazil is likely to spur panicky buying. Two severe frosts in 1994, one in late June and another in early July, cut Brazil's 1995/96 crop by some 50 per cent and sent futures prices to near 10-year highs. In New York another rally was sparked by long-term weather outlooks calling for a cool air mass to make its way into Argentina - and possibly sweeping into southern Brazil - next week. Bur forecasters warned that the chance of damaging frost was slim. The probability of climatic problems this year is very minor as statistically they do not repeat themselves very often, Oswald Arana, president of the Brazilian Coffee Exporters Federation and also a coffee producer, said. The key danger months are June, July and August, although a frost has been recorded at the end of May in the last 100 years. Spot May soared 15.55 cents/lb to close at 277.05 cents/lb while July added 14.60 cents/lb to close at 255.20 cents/lb. The outlook remains bullish, although there could be vicious technical corrections the higher the market goes. FUNDAMENTALS UNITED STATES - Supplies of green coffee housed in US warehouses rose in April by 198,000 60-kg bags, to 1.855 million bags, the Green Coffee Association of New York reported. Estimates had ranged from a slight decrease to a 250,000 to 300,000 bag increase. Port of New Orleans posted the largest gain in coffee stocks rising by 201,000 to 752,000 bags, the GCA said. Inventories decreased by 41,000 bags in Laredo, Texas, a major receiving point for Mexican coffee while stocks in San Francisco rose by 18,000 bags to 159,000 bags. Stocks in Houston declined by 37,000 bags to 121,000 bags. UNITED STATES - The CSCE reported certified coffee stocks increased by 1,770 60-kg bags to 37,182 bags as of May 14. There were 18,040 bags of coffee pending grading, the Exchange said. UNITED KINGDOM - LIFFE certified coffee stocks rose to 4,858 5-tonne lots in April from 4,008 lots in March, the Exchange said. For May coffee, members have an option of grading under the new or the old system, which expires at the end of this month. Coffee graded under the old rules will have to be re-graded, which would incur additional costs. BRAZIL - Brazil's 1997/98 coffee crop should reach 24 million 60-kg bags, up from a previous forecast of 23.2 million bags, the Brazilian Coffee Exporters Association (Abecafe) said. Of the total, 19.5 million bags are forecast to be of arabica coffee and 4.5 million bags of robusta against the February figures of 18.7 million and 4.5 million bags respectively. No figure was given for the 1996/97 crop. The Association still expects to see a production deficit of around 4 million bags in 1997/98 despite the higher estimate. Given expectations of the shortfall, Abecafe is calling for a 'transparent and co-ordinated' plan for the sale of government stocks throughout the 1997/98 crop year. BELGIUM - Belgium imported 2.375 million bags of coffee in 1996, 15 per cent more than was imported the previous year. Main suppliers of green coffee in 1996 were Ivory Coast (106,100 vs 62,200 bags), Uganda (185,300 vs 41,700 bags), Brazil (293,500 vs 231,800 bags) and Colombia (165,900 vs 73,400 bags). The country exported 1.561 million bags of coffee in 1996, 30 per cent more than the 1.204 million bags exported the previous year.

ECAT	The Slovak trade deficit widened to nearly 28 billion crowns year-on-year in the first four months of 1997, prompting analyst calls for central bank moves to ease its tight monetary policy. The statistical bureau (SUSR) on Tuesday said the trade deficit totalled 27.908 billion crowns for the January-April period, up from 21.498 billion for the same period in 1996. SUSR said the deficit was boosted by a large increase in imports, mainly cars and other vehicles, coupled with a slowing in export growth. But analysts said the figure also showed that the future development of country's economy might be in peril unless the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) softened its strict monetary policy, characterised by high interest rates. "The widening of the trade gap is, simply said, very bad considering the current pressure on our currency," Vladimir Kuklis of CSOB bank told Reuters. "The NBS should change its policy before the economy stops producing and therefore exporting," he said. The NBS has been fighting to keep the Slovak crown strong setting the currency above market rates by its daily fixing while keeping the market short of liquidity to prevent foreign borrowing of crowns for short-selling. "I can imagine decreasing bank minimum reserves and softening the restrictive effective rather than enourmously high rates which, anyway, did not make the crown less immune against the attack we have seen in these days," Kuklis said. SUSR said exports totalled 95.270 billion crowns, an increase of 16.7 percent over January-April 1996. Imports, led by a 37.5 percent rise in fossil fuels and mineral oils, rose by 19.5 percent year-on-year in the first four months of 1997, totalling 123.178 billion crowns. Technological imports for upgrading the ageing Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear power plant and completion of the Mochovce nuclear plant also figured heavily in the deficit. Iron and rolled steel were the main exports, rising 13.4 percent year-on-year, while the fastest rising item on the export side were cars which were up 118 percent against January-April period of 1996. "There are more questions over the future of the entire economy...than we expected just a few weeks before, due to the latest developments," said Peter Krutil of Creditanstalt. Added Kuklis: "If the gap were the result of high technology imports everything would be O.K. in a type of economy such as ours. But if we accelerate the plunge by buying mobile phones." The Czech Republic remained Slovakia's main trading partner, accounting for 27.9 percent of exports and 23.2 percent of imports. Exports to Germany accounted for 24 percent, followed by Austria and Italy, with 6.3 and 5.4 percent, respectively. -- Bratislava Newsroom, 421-7-521-8402
CCAT	Israel's Dead Sea Works Ltd said on Tuesday that targeted marketing had enabled it to boost third-quarter earnings, despite lower sales due to a weaker world market for its main product, potash. "Selective targeting of sales to strong agricultural markets ...effectively maintained the level of sales prices despite the decrease in demand," the company said in a statement. Volume sales of potash, an agrochemical, fell to 505,000 metric tonnes in the quarter from 688,000 a year earlier, the company said. Earlier, it reported a decline in unconsolidated revenues to $80.129 million in the quarter from $100.340 million a year ago. Net income, however, rose to $10.874 million, or $0.04 a share, from $9.757 million, or $0.03 a share. Gross profit also rose, by 1.3 percent, and operating profit by 16.1 percent in the three months. Dead Sea Works, a subsidiary of Israel Chemicals Ltd, attributed the improved profitability to increased production output and cost-cutting measures. Dead Sea Works has been reporting on a consolidated basis since the second quarter of this year to reflect its new joint venture holdings in Dead Sea Magnesium, which it controls with Volkswagen, and in the U.S. company Clearon Inc. But the company provided no year-on-year comparisons. Dead Sea Works said construction of the Dead Sea Magnesium plant was nearing completion and that production was scheduled to begin early next year. - Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
ECAT	July producer price index data, released at 0900 GMT, failed to excite South African markets on Monday, coming in bang in line with the Reuters consensus forecast, up 6.6 percent year-on-year. But the breakdown of the figures confounded many analysts with no perceptible price pressure from imports during the month. The month-on-month rate of increase in imported products was nil, giving an annual rate of 4.9 percent. Some economists had predicted the imported component would rise over six percent, reflecting the sharp fall in the rand this year. Locally produced items, however, increased 1.1 percent month-on-month, or 7.3 percent year-on-year. The Central Statistical Service said there were relatively large monthly increases in the price indices for agriculture (up 1.4 percent), fishing (+4.6), food at manufacturing (+2.0), beverages (+2.1), leather (+1.4), footwear (+6.4), wood (+2.2), paper (+1.4), chemicals (+1.8) rubber and plastic (+3.4) and gas and water (+10.2). -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003
GCAT	Former Australian Labor senator Mal Colston, seen a key player in the Senate power balance, said on Tuesday that he was likely to vote against the government's new labour relations legislation when it comes before the Senate later this year. But he said he he had yet to decide which way he would vote on the government's legislation to sell a third of telecommunications firm Telstra Corp.   "I've indicated fairly clearly that I'm disinclined to support the industrial relations legislation," Colston said in an interview with Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. Colston resigned from the opposition Labor party on August 20 to become an independent and was voted deputy president of the senate with the support of the governing Liberal and National parties. The government currently is two votes short of a majority in the senate and Colston's new independent status was seen by the government as improving its chances of passing legislation such as the Industrial Relations and Telstra bills.   Colston said in his resignation letter, his only public statement before this interview, that his Senate voting patterns would be influenced by his long-held Labor beliefs and by his acceptance that the government had an electoral mandate to pursue a number of issues. The Liberal-National coalition government elected on March 2 campaigned to reform industrial relations laws and to sell a third of Telstra. "I think it's fairly clear it has a mandate for its industrial relations legislation, but I'm not going to support that," Colston said.   He said he had some concerns about the Telstra sale bill, which has already been blocked once in the Senate, but that he had not made a decision yet. "At this stage I'm not indicating which way I'm looking at the Telstra issue," he said. Colston said he was taken aback by reported comments from Telecommunciations Minister Richard Alston on Sunday that the government would eventually sell all of Telstra. But Prime Minister John Howard's comments on Monday that the government was only committed to a one third sale had corrected that, Colston said.   Fellow independent senator Brian Harradine was widely reported on Monday as being concerned by Alston's comments and was reconsidering his position on Telstra. Colston, a senator from Queensland, said he was concerned that Telstra employees working outside metropolitan areas in Queensland continue to do so once it is privatised. He said also it was not clear that the Telstra sale was one of the issues the government had a mandate for.   "I don't think it's as clear as that because that partial sale of Telstra is tied up with a number of other things and I'm not prepared to say at this stage there's a clear cut mandate, but I'm not prepared to say there isn't," he said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800
CCAT	German chemicals group Hoechst AG has signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture with Thai Petrochemical Industry Plc to produce polypropylene in Thailand, company sources said. The companies are set to sign an agreement in February in which Trespaphan GmbH, Hoechst's polypropylene film subsidiary, will hold a 51 percent stake. TPI would hold 49 percent, they told Reuters on Thursday. The companies would jointly invest in building a new plant at TPI's existing facilities in eastern Rayong to produce 25,000 tonnes of polypropylene a year, the majority of which will be exported to ASEAN countries, the sources said. TPI's propylene cracker would be on stream in February and provide raw material for the polypropylene production joint venture, TPI executives said. Investment costs and likely starting date have yet to be disclosed. Polypropylene is used primarily in wrapping products.
CCAT	Bulgaria's Finance Ministry has replaced the board of directors of Bulgaria's debt-ridden Balkan Airlines in a bid to stabilise the state carrier's finances, Bulgarian radio said on Monday. The radio said Valeri Doganov would manage the firm. Doganov was the airline's executive director in 1994. Last month trade unions accused the board of being unable to manage the firm. Balkan, hit by heavy losses in recent years, is expected to increase its debts by $15 million this year, transport ministry officials said. -- Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561
MCAT	U.S. Treasuries moved narrowly by midday Tokyo on Tuesday as the market cautiously awaited the release of U.S. retail sales data on Wednesday for clues to whether the recent downward trend would continue, traders said. Light short-covering was detected in thin Tokyo trading, but lingering selling pressure following the bonds' steep fall on Friday was keeping trade in a tight range, they added. A trader at a Japanese brokerage house said market players were hesitant to take biased positions ahead of the data while trying to find out if Friday's nosedive was a temporary retreat from the recent strong rally.
CCAT	LONDON, April 30 ( Reuter)- Lockheed Martin Corp, will decide by mid-June on whether to proceed with the joint development of a new tanker/transport aircraft, Flight International said. The three companies have completed a "Phase I" study for what Lockheed-Martin describes as the New Strategic Aircraft (NSA), Flight said in its latest issue. It added that Lockheed-Martin Aeronautics sector president Mickey Blackwell told Flight that the U.S. group and the two European companies are discussing whether to proceed jointly to concept development. The possibility of a joint programme "looks favourable" but added that Blackwell said it is not clear whether development would be with the two European companies individually, or collectively or with Airbus Industrie consortium itself. The NSA is seen as a replacement for both Lockheed's  C-141 strategic airlifter and the Boeing KC-135 tanker aircraft at a cost of around $100 million, but not as a competitor for Europe's proposed Future Large Aircraft(FLA). It quotes Blackwell as saying Airbus has offered Lockheed "substantial" work on both its stretched long range A340 aircraft and the proposed A3XX large airliner. --Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+5017
GCAT	Australia coach Greg Smith has played down the risk involved in switching Tim Horan to an unfamiliar fly-half role in the first test against France on Saturday. Smith's strategy of taking on France at their own running game will depend heavily on the success of his bold gamble in switching Horan from his normal test position at centre. "With his experience and collective skills, we believe Tim is worth a go in the number 10 jersey," Smith said. "We need a fly-half who will take us into the future...I doubt very much that Tim Horan will fail." Horan, who has played all but two of his 47 tests in the centre, was preferred at number 10 ahead of specialist fly-halves David Knox, Scott Bowen and Elton Flatley. Horan admitted his selection could be regarded as a gamble by the Wallabies given his lack of experience in the position. "I suppose it could be seen that way but I feel confident about taking on the job," the Queensland veteran said. Smith has opted for speed and mobility in his team selection with the aim of attacking the Five Nations champions from all positions. Australia will try to match French attacking flair with a game that relies on each player being capable of running at speed at opponents, he said. "We will try to do the same. We've picked 15 players who are all mobile and who can all have an impact with the ball. Horan, whose tackling strength was thought to be a key factor in his being preferred to Knox, said his priority would be defence. "My aim every time I go out on the field is not to miss a tackle," said Horan, whose previous appearances for Australia outside the centres were on the wing. "I've got to make sure my defence is capable of stopping them before the advantage line," said Horan, who played at full-back for Queensland during this year's Super 12 competition. Smith rated France and South Africa on a par as rugby powers, behind only New Zealand in his estimation. France coach Jean-Claude Skrela said France would not be trying to prove a point for European rugby against Australia. Asked whether the result would indicate the relative strength of northern and southern hemisphere rugby," Skrela said:"We are not playing for Europe or for the Five Nations, we are playing only for France." Skrela was forced to shuffle his back line after injuries ruled out centre Christophe Lamaison and fly-half Alain Penaud. Richard Dourthe was named in midfield while David Aucagne comes in at fly-half in two of the six changes from the side that clinched the Five Nations grand slam in March. Lock Olivier Brouzet forced his way into the side at the expense of Hugues Miorin, while prop Christian Califano returns after missing one game because of suspension. Winger Philippe Bernat-Salles was also recalled and Philippe Carbonneau was named at scrum-half. France, who have beaten Queensland, ACT and Victoria so far on tour, will face Australia in the second and final test in Brisbane on June 28. Teams: France - 15-Jean-Luc Sadourny; 14-Philippe Bernat-Salles, 13-Richard Dourthe, 12-Thomas Castaignede, 11-David Venditti; 10-David Aucagne, 9-Philippe Carbonneau; 8-Fabien Pelous, 7-Olivier Magne, 6-Abdel Benazzi (captain), 5-Olivier Merle, 4-Olivier Brouzet, 3-Christian Califano, 2-Marc Dal Maso, 1-Franck Tournaire.

GCAT	Seven people have been shot dead in inter-clan fighting in South Africa's troubled KwaZulu-Natal province, homeland of the country's nine million Zulu people, police said on Monday. Four men aged between 40 and 60 were killed about midday on Sunday by a gang of men armed with AK-47 assault rifles in Nongoma, in the north of the province, police spokesman Vish Naidoo said. "Three people were shot dead and another was wounded this morning (Monday) in what we suspect is a revenge attack," he told Reuters. The Sunday killings occurred as President Nelson Mandela, making a speech in KwaZulu-Natal, repeated an appeal for peace in the region. "The motive for the attacks is believed to be related to the ongoing factional fighting in the area," Naidoo added.

GCAT	Bangladesh continued a massive relief operation on Sunday in coastal areas and islands battered by a cyclone, with 105 known to have been killed and 400 fishermen still missing at sea. Seven ministers, three navy vessels and hundreds of troops are heading the relief work following the 200 kph (125 mph) storm on Monday, officials said on Sunday. Officials said on Sunday 11 people had died of diarrhoea but Red Crescent workers in Chittagong said the disease was under control, with most of the people along the coast having received supplies of water purifying tablets, medicine and saline solution. "The spread of the disease has been contained," one said. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has ordered no let-up in efforts to get food and medicine to the 2.5 million people affected. India on Sunday airlifted several tonnes of medicines and relief materials to Dhaka for the victims. A planeload of relief supplies from Saudi Arabia also arrived in Dhaka on Sunday, and more will follow, government officials said. The U.S. government has offered $25,000 in immediate assistance, an American embassy official in Dhaka said. Government officials rejected charges by opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia that the government was trying to "politicise" the relief operations. "We don't play politics with people in distress. It's a humanitarian issue and we are pledged to keep it out of politics," one said. Khaleda, a former prime minister and head of Bangladesh's Nationalist Party, said on Saturday that relief materials had hardly reached the cyclone victims. Officials said on Sunday army and civil volunteers were helping cyclone victims to rebuild their homes while hundreds of medical teams were treating the injured and battling disease. Fishing community leader Kabir Ahmed said the fate of the 400 missing fishermen was uncertain. "We have not given up hope yet. I only wish they all will come back," he said in Cox's Bazar. Low-lying Bangladesh is vulnerable to cyclones. Its worst storm in 1991 killed at least 138,000 people and left millions homeless.

Algeria increased its direct tax collecting by 59.5 percent to 36.7 billion dinars ($658 million) in 1996 from 23 billion dinars in 1995, as a result of a tighter policy set early in 1996 to stem tax evasion. - A bomb explodes outside a high school in Algiers: a crime against schoolchildren. - The independent poll watchdog urges its workers to ensure fairness of elections to be held in June.

MCAT	Dollar/mark ended higher, preserving modest gains posted ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday, but dollar/yen slipped after the impact of a call for a weaker yen by a Japanese official wore off. The dollar continued to recover from a slide to 1.5415 marks in Europe, with traders opting to cover shorts just before the outcome of a meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers was announced at 1414 EST/1914 GMT. In the end, dealers got what they expected when Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee concluded with no change in U.S. interest rates. The dollar closed at 1.5495/05 marks, up from 1.5488/93 at the open. But it slipped to 113.80/90 yen from 114.11/21. The dollar shot above the 114 yen level in overseas trade after the Japanese cabinet member, Kabun Muto, director- general of the Management and Coordination Agency, told reporters in Tokyo that the yen should be "slightly cheaper" to prevent private companies from moving production overseas. "I think the day was really highlighted by talk this morning that a Japanese cabinet member was talking up the dollar/yen," said Bob Near, vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Bank of New York. But Muto, the minister in charge of reforming the Japanese bureaucracy, is not part of the Ministry of Finance, which sets exchange rate policy in Japan. The dollar drifted lower after the ministry reportedly said Muto was speaking for himself, traders noted. "He clearly doesn't have authority on dollar/yen; he was talking to a domestic audience, no doubt," Near added. Traders bought marks and sold dollars in Europe after Otmar Issing, Bundesbank chief economist, criticized measures reached on Friday to prevent European Union (EU) nations from running up budget deficits after Economic and Monetary Union. "It's kind of telling you there could be a confrontation between Bonn and the Bundesbank," said James Powers, vice president of foreign exchange at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in New York. The mark tends to strengthen when the Bundesbank lashes out against the plan to replace the German unit with the euro, which could start off as a weak currency because some of the participating countries are expected to have difficulty maintaining sound fiscal policies after convergence. But the dollar found its footing against the mark after the head of the French central bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, told Reuters Financial Television the market tends to underestimate the economic fundamentals for the dollar. Traders said they construed Trichet's remark as another in a string of recent French calls for a higher dollar. In addition, after weighing on the dollar early in the session, the U.S. stock market helped spur the dollar above 1.55 marks when it moved sharply from the minus to the plus column later in the day, traders said. "On any sign of weakness in stocks, people sell the dollar down and on any signs of strength people buy it back," said Jeffrey Yu, senior dealer at Sanwa Bank in New York. But a slide in U.S. Treasury bonds after a report of a 9.2 percent surge in November U.S. housing starts, the biggest rise since July 1995, did no lasting damage to the dollar. In other trade, the dollar rose to 1.3255/65 Swiss francs from 1.3224/34 at the open but fell to Canadian $1.3627/32 from C$1.3703/08. The pound rose to $1.6712/22 from $1.6668/78 and the Australian dollar rose to $0.7958/63 from $0.7934/39. ((-- Alden Bentley, 212 859 1667))

The deficit in 1995 was 15.9 billion crowns.

CCAT	New York-based hedge fund Tiger Management Corp in principle supports a merger between the Storebrand ASA group and commercial bank Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse ASA, a close source to the fund said on Thursday. Tiger Management Corp owns around 10 percent of the total capital in Storebrand, Norway's largest insurance company. Storebrand and Christiania said on Wednesday they planned to merge to form Norway's biggest financial group with a market capitalisation of 26 billion crowns. On Thursday Norwegian billionaire entrepreneur Kjell Inge Roekke said he had raised his stake in Storebrand also to 10 percent. The third major shareholder in the insurer is Norwegian food-based conglomerate Orkla ASA, which has a near 10 percent stake. "That means that if Roekke and Orkla want to block the merger, they won't get backing from Tiger," the source said. Roekke said in March that he had bought around six percent of ordinary Storebrand stock through his private Liberian-registered company Ivory Enterprises Corp as a private investment. Market sources have since been waiting to see what the entrepreneur would do with the stock. "We're scratching our heads at what he wants to do," the source said. -- Steinar Dyrnes, Oslo newsroom, +47 22 42 50 41
MCAT	Interbank rates were mostly unchanged on Monday with very few borrowers and lenders in the market, dealers said. Market liquidity had improved further following maturities of a 420-million ringgit long term government bond issue and a 500-million ringgit Bank Negara bills issue last week, but borrowing by some large banks, which were believed to be short of funds, had kept rates steady. "I don't see much movements over the next few days. There's no new Bank Negara bills issue or maturity this week," said a dealer with a Malaysian bank. One-week money was at 6.50/90 percent against 6.5/7.0 on Friday and three-week was unchanged at 7.10/20 percent. One-month money at 7.25/30 percent, three-month at 7.30/35 and six-month at 7.35/40, were all unchanged. Dealers said maturity of a 900-million ringgit long term government bond issue on May 15 could exert some pressure on rates again. "If the issue is not rolled over, rates may come off again," said another local bank dealer. There have been rumours that the central bank will announce a fresh Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) issue. The overnight interbank rate is expected to trade between 6.0 and 7.0 percent. It closed on Friday at 6.5 percent. The overnight rate shot up to 8.7 percent last Wednesday due to borrowing by big banks. Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were also steady. At 0300 GMT, the benchmark three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) December contract was unchanged at 92.66, or an implied yield of 7.34 percent. June and September were untraded. -- Syed Azman (603-206 2323) .

CCAT	Norfolk Southern Corp said Monday that it is talking with CSX Corp about their respective offers to acquire Conrail Inc. "The basis for NS's participation in these discussions is its commitment to provide strong competitive service in the East for rail customers," Norfolk said in a release.   Norfolk Southern has been vying with CSX to acquire Philadelpha-based Conrail. Last week Norfolk sued to block CSX's proposed $8.4 billion merger with Conrail, after launching an unsolicited $100 cash per share bid for Conrail.
GCAT	French President Jacques Chirac said on Friday he saw a "revolution" in Europe in its growing acceptance of a need for a social model to protect its citizens from unemployment and poverty. Chirac, speaking two days ahead of a parliamentary election in France, also said Europe needed to look harder at ways of reviving weak economic growth, which he blamed for joblessness and exclusion of many from mainstream society. France has long fought for Europe to maintain much of its system of welfare and worker protection, rather than adopting the free market policies of the United States which some believe would help bring down its record unemployment. Chirac said the idea of a "social model" was gathering support, and noted plans to make legally binding a commitment to fighting unemployment through a revision to European Union treaties. Britain's new Labour government has also agreed to sign up to the European Union's social chapter, which sets minimum standards for workers, reversing years of resistance by the outgoing conservatives. "If we succeed in getting the idea of a European social model taken on board, it is a revolution," he told a news conference during a summit of EU leaders in the Dutch seaside town of Noordwijk. Chirac said he had stressed the need to tackle weak growth during the summit. "Europe is the only region in the world where growth is weak," he said. "We have to go a bit further to look for solutions to this problem of inadequate growth and its social consequences." He said only one European leader had called for greater labour force flexibility to reduce joblessness -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair -- and was greeted with silence. And while Europe needed to reduce the social charges which weighed too heavily on the cost of labour, it must avoid the kind of full liberalisation which would fragment society. France's centre-right government, campaigning for re-election in the two-round vote on May 25 and June 1, has been fighting to fend off charges by the opposition Socialist party that its policies would exacerbate unemployment and poverty through new austerity measures. Chirac's comments appeared meant to underline the commitment of the mainstream right-wing in France to work actively to boost growth and tackle unemployment.
CCAT	Wickes Inc said Wednesday that, while it expects to report a profit for the second quarter, results will be below a year ago. Wickes earned $0.29 a share on sales of $228.8 million in the year-ago second quarter. The company also said it expects to report increased revenues and improved gross margin percentage for the second quarter. Total sales volume increased 3.7 percent versus the 1996 second quarter, it added.   The company said the projected decline in second quarter profit was due to more than $2.0 million in expenses related to several new growth initiatives. "Our goal is to continue to build existing and new relationships with the professional builder not only by meeting supply needs but by providing value added products and services," J. Steven Wilson, chairman, said in a statement. Wilson said Wickes is aiming to expand customer relationships in high growth markets, expand product mix and service capabilities in existing and new markets and to continue to expand value-added manufacturing capabilties.   Other objectives include expanding partnering relationships with builders and decreasing the impact of seasonality by expanding into new geographic markets. Wickes said its core business has historically been the distribution of building materials through a network of more than 100 building centers in 24 states. It also operates 12 component manufacturing facilities that produce pre-hung door units, window assemblies, roof and floor trusses and framed wall panels. During the quarter, Wickes began revitalizing several current and closed facilities where custom home builders, repair and remodel contractors and project do-it-yourself customers are dominant. Locations include Pascagoula, Miss., Phoenix, N.Y., and Grand Rapids, Mich. It also created a dedicated building material operation in Pensacola, Fla. Wickes said it is test marketing a number of new services for its customers under pilot programs, including utilities marketing and mortgage lending. "We realize that these kinds of investments may have an impact on earnings in the near term," Wilson said. "However, we hope to see these efforts begin to pay off in the near future."

MCAT	Italian bond prices are taking a hammering as investors are seized by doubts over Italy's chances of restoring its state finances to health in time to secure a place in a European currency union planned for 1999. "What we are seeing is a much more rational assessment of Italy's chances of taking part (in monetary union)," said Ken Wattret, an economist at Banque Paribas' London office. A key barometer of international investor confidence in Italy's improving financial well-being -- the "spread" between 10-year BTPs and German Bunds -- is predicting stormy weather ahead. The spread, which measures the risk premium investors are willing to pay for holding Italian treasury paper rather than its German equivalent, has widened sharply in recent weeks and ballooned out to 208 basis points on Monday. The June contract on London's LIFFE market sagged by 130 basis points on Monday and was quoted at 124.35 in late trading. Market commentators say that behind the sagging confidence in Italy's financial well-being are nagging doubts over the government's ability to keep in motion a virtuous circle of falling interest rates and improving state finances. The government has placed joining a European economic and monetary union (EMU) on its 1999 launch date at the centre of its strategy to slash a huge public sector deficit. As confidence grew in Italy's determination to meet tough qualifying criteria for EMU membership, interest rates would start to tumble along with the costs of servicing Italy's huge national debt, the government hoped. Investors for a time bet that Italy would achieve a "convergence" with its more prosperous northern neighbours -- notably France and Germany. Italian bond prices soared and the all-important spread narrowed to 138 basis points in January. "The Italian convergence rally was based on optimism over Italy making it in the first wave of EMU (European and economic monetary union)," said David Brown, chief economist at Bear Stearns International. "The EMU optimism was overbought and if it unwinds you could get a real blowing out of the BTP/Bund spreads," said Brown. The spread is now widely expected to widen to 250 basis points in the coming weeks. "The scope for divergence is now greater than for divergence, said Alex Garrard, economist at London-based UBS. "We are now advising investors to get out of the market if it goes below 200," he added. Investors have been unsettled by the difficulties Prime Minister Romano Prodi has been having in forging a consensus behind a supplementary budget which he must get through to keep Italy's quest for EMU membership on track. Doubts have also been fuelled by signs that Italy is running out of time if it wants to take interest rates lower and thereby force down the cost of its heavy debt-servicing burden. "In the United States there is a big possibility of interest rate rises and this will not help bonds," said a London-based economist with a major international investment bank who asked not to be named. "When the big bond markets decline the peripheral ones will fall even further," he added. Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio held back from cutting interest rates last year until he was convinced that inflationary expectations had been squeezed out of the economy. The central bank last cut the discount rate to 6.75 percent from 7.50 percent on January 22. As the German economy picks up, the signs are that the Bundesbank may have to tighten monetary policy in the coming months. "The Bundesbank is moving from a neutral-to-down bias to to a neutral-to-up bias," said Francesco Giordano, economist at CSFB in London. "This is bad for Italy which is behind in the interest rate cycle and it could find it hard to cut rates," he added.
GCAT	A Yemeni threw a hand-grenade at a group of soldiers and killed two of them, an official said on Tuesday. "What happened unfortunately is that a citizen threw a hand-grenade at a security unit. There were two martyrs," Saeed al-Hekaimi, spokesman for the Supreme Election Committee, told reporters. "Investigations are underway on the matter. This is not an election dispute or an election crime. It's a criminal act." Hekaimi said the incident in the city of Taiz, 260 km (160 miles) south of the capital Sanaa, took place on Monday. Yemenis voted in parliamentary elections on Sunday. The elections and pre-election period have been marred by several violent attacks which have claimed more than 10 lives. Before voting began, a soldier on Sunday started shooting at people randomly at a polling station in the southern town of Mukayras, killing five soldiers and three civilians. A Western election observer had said a security official was shot dead in a separate incident on Sunday in the town of Dhamar, about 100 km (60 miles) south of Sanaa.
CCAT	Medical products firm Baxter Ltd, a subsidiary of Baxter World Trade Corporation of the United States, is seeking to establish new export markets in Germany, Italy and Spain, Baxter Ltd general manager Sergio Vella said on Monday.

GCAT	Victory for Michael Schumacher and third place to Eddie Irvine in Sunday's rain-hit Monaco Grand Prix have ushered in a new era for Ferrari. For the first time since double world champion Schumacher joined the team after leaving Benetton in 1995, Ferrari took over the leadership of both the Formula One drivers' and constructors' championships. "This is a beautiful dream for the team," said Ferrari sporting director Jean Todt. "To have both cars on the podium, one first and one third, at Monaco...But I think we still have a long road ahead of us. "We must celebrate the result, enjoy the moment and then stop dreaming. Once this is over, we have to go testing in Barcelona and back to work." Despite Todt's caution after seeing his team end a 16-year drought without a Monaco win, it is clear that Ferrari pose a greater threat than at any time since Jody Scheckter of South Africa claimed their last drivers' title in 1979. Schumacher, the 28-year-old German who lifted the drivers' crown with Benetton in 1994 and 1995, demonstrated why on Sunday with a peerless drive through the rain to win easily by more than 53 seconds. He and his team mate Briton Eddie Irvine, who  has reeled off three successive podium finishes, have both praised new technical director Ross Brawn, formerly with Benetton, for the transformation in their fortunes. Briton Brawn joined the team last December, together with chief designer Rory Byrne, after working with Schumacher during his championship successes at Benetton. According to the German, he has brought a calm and methodical style of management to the team. "Ross likes to work in a logical way, with a programme, and he does not become emotional when he is in his work," said Schumacher. "This has been a welcome quality for the team." Schumacher, however, agreed with team chief Todt after Sunday's race when he said he did not think he or Ferrari were yet ready to challenge Williams for the world titles. Looking ahead to the Spanish Grand Prix at Barcelona in two weeks, he said: "To be honest, I would prefer to cancel Spain. It is not a circuit which suits our car. "But now that I have opened up a small gap in the championship, I suppose I can afford to just go for a finish in the points and it will still look good. "After Spain, though, I think we will be looking reasonably good for the rest of the season. There are some more improvements to come with the car and I am confident about the reliability." Despite Schumacher's pessimism, he won with Benetton in 1995 and with Ferrari in the wet last year. While Ferrari celebrated on Sunday night, the Williams team decamped from Monaco grim-faced after a disastrous error in weather-forecasting persuaded them to gamble on dry slick tyres and dry set-ups for the wet race. Both Jacques Villeneuve of Canada and Heinz-Harald Frentzen of Germany failed to finish and the team unexpectedly looked second best in all departments. "Our choice was based on a forecast of very fine drizzle for the first 20 or 30 minutes of the race," said team boss Frank Williams, who also pointed out that their forecaster had been accurate at all four previous races this year. "If it had worked this time, we would have been heroes," he added. "But it didn't."

CCAT	The Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul set a base price of 440 million reais for a 35 percent stake in Companhia Riograndense de Telecomunicacoes SA (CRT), which it plans to auction on December 17, officials said Thursday. Bid specifications were published in local newspapers on Thursday, outlining conditions set on the sale of 262,352,653 shares of telecommunications company, state officials said. Six foreign-led consortia have prequalified to bid on the shares, according to state officials.   The tender document also sets the guidelines for the disbursal of another 22,487,340 shares, or three percent of the total, which are being offered to workers. The CRT sale is being closely watched because it will kick off the privatization of Brazil's telecoms, including Telebras, the huge telecommunications concern owned by the federal government. Envelopes containing economic proposals will be presented at 1100 local/0800 EST/1300 GMT on December 17 at the Rio Grande do Sul industry federation convention center in Porto Alegre.   The six prequalfied groups -- consisting of 25 companies -- have a total net worth of $186 billion. They are: * France Telecom with Brazil's Banco Opportunity, Banco do Brasil and pension funds Previ, Sistel, CRT Employees Fund and Telos. The group's net worth: 46.5 billion reais. * Korea Telecom of South Korea, with Brazil's Odebrecht, Stelar Telecom, Unibanco and Folha de Sao Paulo. Net worth: 18.4 billion reais.
MCAT	German shares roller-coastered on Monday, falling in electronic trade but rallying strongly thereafter to end bourse higher as the market shook off earlier uncertainties about EMU and the left's victory in France. The DAX index of 30 German blue-chips ended 57.78 points, or 1.63 percent, higher at 3,605.62 points, while the June DAX future contract also recovered strongly, rising 56 points to 3,620 points. Sentiment was hit in early electronic trade by an upset victory for the French left wing in Sunday's election. "The socialists are going to play a more important role in Europe again," said one trader, adding that this had a bad effect on the market. There had also been concern for the stability of the proposed single European currency, the euro, after the Bundesbank and the German finance ministry clashed on revaluing Germany's reserves. "Everything is based around the euro being delayed. If it looked like the euro is in serious danger, then we could have a clear consolidation," the trader said. A Frankfurt broker agreed: "There is a lot of uncertainty about, what with the gold reserves revaluation being debated back and forth and the uncertainty after the French elections. It doesn't add to confidence at the start of the week." "There are numbers coming out of the U.S. this week as well, so you might have people sitting on the sidelines waiting for those," the broker said, referring to NAPM figures today and factory orders figures on Wednesday. "This is not a crash day, but we're not going up anywhere," he said. The strength of the dollar boosted exporters, including the carmakers. Volkswagen AG ended bourse up 25 marks at 1,129 marks, while BMW ended up seven marks at 1,406 marks. Daimler-Benz AG ended up 2.30 marks at 133.80 points.
GCAT	The only son of comedian Bill Cosby was killed by an unidentified gunman early on Thursday as he stopped to change a flat tire on his Mercedes-Benz convertible along a California freeway. The body of Ennis Cosby, 27, was found sprawled on the pavement next to his dark green car and police said they had a witness to the attack. A white male suspect was being sought and investigators said robbery appeared to be the motive. Bill Cosby, a 59-year-old star of film and television and one of America's most popular comedians, was grief-stricken but kept his composure when told of his son's death, police said. "He was my hero," a grim-faced, puffy-eyed Cosby told reporters outside his apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The entertainer, whose TV comedy series "Cosby" is filmed in New York, appealed to the Los Angeles Police Department to "do anything possible to find and locate and prosecute the suspect," said Cmdr. Tim McBride, a police spokesman. "We have every confidence in the LAPD," Cosby said in a statement released by his publicist. "Our hearts go out to each and every family that such an incident occurs to. This is a life experience that's truly difficult to share." Cosby planned to fly to Los Angeles to make funeral arrangements, police said. Ennis was Cosby's only son. The comedian and his wife Camille also have four daughters. The younger Cosby overcame learning disabilities to earn a master's degree in special education at Columbia University's Teachers College in 1995 and was studying for his doctorate, college spokesman Roy Campbell said. He spent his last day at the college on Dec. 18 tutoring a young boy with learning disabilities and was due to return next week when classes resume, Campbell said. "He was dedicating his life to the noblest of professions -- educating our children -- and yet that same life was stolen," said former New York City mayor David Dinkins, a professor of public affairs at Columbia. The attack took place just after midnight near an exit ramp off the San Diego Freeway, about 15 miles (25 km) west of downtown Los Angeles. Cosby was heading north to a friend's house in the San Fernando Valley, police said. "He apparently experienced a flat tire, pulled his car off the freeway and was apparently shot for unknown reasons," McBride told reporters. A woman saw at least part of the attack and described the gunman as a white male, he said. Police declined to identify the witness, but a woman in a short skirt and fur coat was seen being questioned by investigators at the scene. A police source said Cosby died of a single gunshot wound. He made at least one call on his cellular phone before the attack but police refused to say to whom the call was made. McBride said robbery was the "logical motive" but noted that "it doesn't appear that anything was taken." He said there was no reason to believe Cosby was being followed or stalked, but added, "he may have been taken by surprise." McBride described Bill Cosby as "extremely upset" but "very coherent" when he was told of his son's death. Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Entertainment, called it an "unthinkable tragedy" and offered his support to the Cosby family. After police cordoned off the crime scene, the body was taken to the coroner's office and the car was towed away for further examination for clues. McBride described the neighbourhood of the attack as "very peaceful, very expensive homes, very little crime ... But every once in a while some unexplainable act of violence occurs, and this was one of them." Bill Cosby is known to millions of TV viewers as a pitchman for various products and for his role as the loveable Dr. Huxtable, the obstetrician-father on NBC's "The Cosby Show," which first aired in the United States in 1984 and remains popular in re-runs worldwide. Cosby, who has written several books including "Fatherhood", is now starring as a father and husband in a new TV series, "Cosby."
ECAT	Swiss M0 money supply grew at a rate of nearly seven percent on an annualised basis in May versus the fourth quarter of 1996, Swiss National Bank Chairman Hans Meyer said.   In May, the seasonally adjusted monetary base was nearly 4.5 percent above the target path set by the SNB, he said in the text of a speech at an SNB news conference. But he said the SNB's monetary policy was not as expansive as it appeared by viewing M0. Part of this was due to strong growth in large-denomination notes in circulation, which currently was around 700 million francs higher than what SNB models had projected. Meyer also said that sight deposits held by commercial banks at the SNB had expanded more strongly than expected and were around 400 million francs above the projected level.   In view of these deviations, there was some doubt as to the reliability of figures about the monetary base. "Monetary policy in any case is not as expansive as the strong growth in this aggregate seems to suggest. If it were to be adjusted to eliminate the expansion from these unexpected factors, then it would be roughly one percent above the medium-term target path," he said. The SNB targets growth in M0 of one percent per year over a five-year period. The current period extends to the end of 1999. -- Zurich newsroom +41 1 631 7340
MCAT	Spanish government bonds ended higher, but off intraday highs after weakness in U.S. Treasuries this afternoon. "The Spanish market's stopped advancing because of the downturn in Treasuries, but the market's base is positive" said one trader. Comments by US Fed Governor Janet Yellen that the US economy had entered an inflationary danger zone had an impact, he said. Bonos were boosted by gains in the peseta against the mark amid expectations of benign domestic inflation and possible near-term rate cuts, dealers said. "The domestic outlook is favourable and the perception of the budget is positive," said one. -- Madrid newsroom +341 585 2160
GCAT	A Jordanian soldier charged with murdering seven Israeli schoolgirls had a history of mental disturbance and once attempted suicide after a row with his mother, a military court heard on Monday. Doctor Nabil al-Hmoud, a medical witness charged with examining the mental state of Private Ahmed Daqamsa after last March's shooting, told the court at first that the soldier had "disturbed personality traits," but was apparently not insane. The court referred Daqamsa for further mental tests by a panel of doctors to assess his state of mind. Daqamsa has not denied shooting the girls, six of them 13 years old and one just 11 years old, but says he acted impulsively after being provoked during Moslem prayers. He is charged with premeditated murder and faces a death sentence if found guilty. The prosecution say he had been planning to kill Israelis for many years but never got the opportunity until the incident. "After examining this person no psychotic or mental illness was apparent and on that basis I made him undergo personality tests," said Major Hmoud, a medical doctor at the state-run King Hussein Medical Centre. But under questioning by defence lawyer Hussein Majalli, Hmoud said in the interest of impartiality Daqamsa needed detailed medical examination on his state of mind. He told the court he was mandated by the military investigators only to verify whether Daqamsa was insane, not to examine in detail his emotional and psychological state. Hmoud revealed, in the most detailed personal profile of Daqamsa so far heard in court, a record of referrals for mental disturbance in the last few years. Daqamsa's hospital file showed he was treated in 1991 for severe emotional stress, with the psychologist even citing some indications of hysterical behaviour. In an earlier episode in 1989 he took an drug overdose in an apparent suicide attempt following a dispute with his mother. But in tests after the shooting the doctor could only say Daqamsa showed agitation and signs of insomnia and no signs of deeper mental anguish. Hmoud said Daqamsa was subjected to two brain scans and a personality test to check if he was psychotic. He said the tests could not reveal any signs of madness but however showed "personality disorders" which included "impulsive behaviour" and a stonger than normal sexual drive. "He is aware of all his actions, but his impulsiveness and his inability to control his actions make him less able than the normal person to control his behaviour," the medical witness said. Asked by chief prosecutor Muhanad Hijazi why Daqamsa shot female victims, Hmoud said:" After the personality test some symptoms show he is inclined to social introvertism and a leaning to sexual motives and some impulsiveness in behaviour." While the prosecution has been focusing on Daqamsa as a sexual deviant, defence lawyers want to portray him as a courageous man who lost his senses in a moment of rage at the behaviour of the Israeli girls.
ECAT	Russia's government hopes industrial output will rise in 1997 for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union as investment is channelled from capital markets into industry, senior officials said on Friday. The government will push down government securities yields further, while modernising companies become more attractive by switching to international accounting standards, First Deputy Economy Minister Ivan Materov told a news conference. "We shall use a carrot and stick policy," he said. Materov said the government planned to push down yields on GKO discount Treasury bills by bringing more foreign investors into the market. He said Russia's first Eurobond, launched last week, and paying annual interest of 9.25 percent, would compete strongly with domestic paper. "It was a blow for domestic market yields," Materov said. T-bills yields have fallen to about 38 percent annually from about 200 percent in the summer. Funds which could be invested in industry total about 450 trillion roubles with about 300 trillion of this coming from households, Materov said. This amounts to 24 percent of gross domestic product, which is about the same as in Japan and South Korea, he said. "For Russia it is serious money," he said. He said that profitability of investment in industry would grow as companies modernise, adding that equipment imports accounted for most of Russia's total imports. Another First Deputy Economy Minister, Yakov Urinson, said investment in industry could offer a 40 percent return, but the investment process was hampered by high risks. These include poor protection of property and shareholders' rights and the widespread non-payment crisis, which is preventing many companies from paying off credits. "The government has prepared several documents and some of them are already in the (State) Duma (lower house) which will make it possible to provide all property rights guarantees," Urinson said. Officially, industrial production has halved since Russia launched its economic reform programme in 1992. Official data show October output was four percent lower than a year earlier. But Urinson said that the official statistics did not show the real picture as a big part of industrial production was hidden from taxes. He said the shadow economy accounted for about 25 percent of output after between 18 and 20 percent in 1995. "According to the Economy Ministry estimations, there is no fall in GDP at all," Urinson said. --Julie Tolkacheva, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
ECAT	U.S. Agriculture Department said Tuesday it would donate about 3,750 tonnes of commodities, including vegetable oil, rice, beans and flour to a private charity to distribute in Georgia. The donation will be made under USDA's Food for Progress program. The supply period is fiscal year 1997.
CCAT	Home Centers Ltd said Wednesday that revenues in May increased 62.7 percent to 31.1 New Israeli Shekels (NIS) up from 19.1 NIS. On May 31, 1997, one U.S. dollar equals 3.394 NIS. Home Centers is an Israeli chain of warehouse-type home improvement centers.
CCAT	The "millennium bug" that has the potential to stop computers in their tracks in the year 2000 is a manageable problem provided people get an early start, commit adequate resources and leave time for testing, several speakers at a conference sponsored by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) said Friday. Rerepresentatives from the banking, thrift and data processing industries and from government repeatedly stressed the dangers of not being prepared. But a few mentioned that obvious beneficiaries of the herculean effort would be programmers who have the training to update old computer code.   Denis O'Leary, executive vice president and chief information officer of Chase Manhttan Corp, said the industry was entering a "raging bull market" for people with information technology skills. "The problem will get increasingly acute over the next five years," he said. During a break in the proceedings, one of the conference participants suggested salaries for people capable of managing year 2000 projects could double as some companies that are behind the curve get desperate.   Chris Carrington, vice president at Electronic Data Systems Corp, said companies not up to handling the task in-house will increasingly turn to outside services. "Demand for year 2000 services will clearly outstrip the supply," he said. "People will be standing at the altar with no one to marry, probably starting in 1998." He said EDS has already turned down some business. He said one frustrated head of a financial services firm told him EDS was the third company to tell him they did not want the job.   John Tenuta, a senior vice president at Fiserv Inc, said one benefit was the opportunity to discard obsolete programs as companies go through their entire list of software. But the emphasis at the conference was clearly on warnings of dangers. Willie Kennedy Jr, senior project manager for the year 2000 at KeyCorp's Key Services, said making sure that outside vendors are supplying "year 2000 compliant" systems is of critical importance. "The bottom line is that if it is not year 2000 compliant it will not come into Key Bank," he said.   He said lawyers have been involved in writing contracts to make sure that guarantees from suppliers are enforceable. Carrington noted that there are programming tools on the market to make the job of conversions easier, but he said "no tool is 100 percent perfect" and he added that "we've found a couple that don't work." He declined to name any products. Sally Katzen, administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), said the cost to the U.S. government to fix its own systems could top $3.0 billion, up from estimates of $2.3 billion several months ago.   She said the U.S. government not only has to get its own systems ready but federal regulatory agencies responsible for transportaton and medicine must make sure private business is ready. Katzen said one area of concern has been pacemakers, the tiny devices that regulate the heartbeat. "We have been assured that they will keep functioning," she said. Stephen Hagen, legislative fellow from the Senate Banking Committee, said the emphasis in Congress has been on "oversight" rather than passing laws to deal with 2000. He said one concern among lawmakers is whether all the work on year 2000 will delay or impede other technology initiatives unrelated to the year 2000 date problem. Robert Albanese, OTS regional director, told the conference his office is going to be stepping up the pace of its scrutiny. He said all of the regional directors of the OTS were sending letters Friday to institutions they supervise with new details of plans to make sure the industry gets the job done in time.

MCAT	Jakarta stocks are expected to be steady on Tuesday following the unveiling on Monday of a fresh economic deregulation package which cut tariffs on 1,600 items and curbed loans to the property sector, brokers said. The measures would generally improve market sentiment as they aimed to increase the economy's efficiency, they said. Coordinating Minister for Economics, Finance and Supervisor of Development Saleh Afiff said the 1,600 items covered 1,461 manufactured products, 136 agricultural products and three items in the health sector.   "Sentiment on property sectors could be mixed following measures contained in the deregulation package," an analyst with Hongkong-based brokerage firm said. The analyst said the market needed time to digest the measures and their impact on property companies. "It seems that firms which have a big land bank will have competitive advantage over those who don't," he said. Brokers expected sentiment on Astra International to be firm on expectation that it will benefit from the deregulation package.   They said food manufacturer Indofood and confectionary Mayora would benefit from the government move to allow sugar producers to import raw sugar, dismantling the monopoly held by state commodities regulator BULOG. Plantatation firms Bakrie Sumatra and London Sumatra are also expected to get market attention following a revision of the export tax structure for palm oil and products under the deregulation package. On Monday, the Jakarta Composite Index closed up 1.41 points, or 0.19 percent, at 738.01 points after hitting a new all-time high of 739.83 points earlier in the day. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
GCAT	Poland's Constitutional Tribunal rejected on Wednesday new laws which gave control of great tracts of land, estimated to be worth more than $1 billion in Warsaw alone, to a society of garden allotment holders. PAP news agency said the Tribunal, which ensures new laws conform with the constitution, ruled against amendments passed by parliament last year, which evoked outraged protests from city authorities including those of the capital. The legislation, backed by the ruling left-wing coalition, handed hosts of the small, lovingly-tended gardens used by almost a million Poles on a 99-year-lease to the Polish Association of Allotment Holders. The Tribunal ruled that last year's law excessively infringed local authorities' ownership rights and it rejected the decision to grant control to only one group, PAP said. The gardens provide a treasured weekend escape for residents of cramped urban apartments and help low-income families or pensioners, who grow food or flowers for sale. The new law was designed to safeguard the holders, who had been renting their plots from the municipalities. But city councils say that they have effectively been stripped of their ownership and that, while wishing to preserve such gardens, they need to use some of the land for important development projects -- with due compensation to gardeners. Warsaw city President Marcin Swiecicki told Reuters before the ruling that in Warsaw's central district alone the issue concerned about 400 hectares (1000 acres) of land, at a time when prime sites were commanding up to $1,000 a square metre. He said that, even if the land value was assessed far lower, "400 hectares reaches a value of more than $1 billion, in the city centre." Warsaw is promoting a building boom as part of a bid to become a regional business centre, and is encouraging office and other construction in open spaces, some of which remain since German invaders levelled the city in World War Two. Mayor Swiecicki said he understood how people valued allotments spaces and wanted them to last as long as possible. But he said that among vital projects affected by the amendments was a plan for a key new road, a proposal to build a European University campus on land currently occupied by allotments on the central Mokotow fields and a sewage project. "The city owns the land and should benefit from it," he said. The Warsaw mayor's office said it had no immediate statement after the Tribunal ruling, which could be over-ruled if the amendment's supporters muster a two-thirds majority in parliament.

CCAT	Hungary signed on Wednesday ten-year concessions for two national TV channels with Luxembourg-based CLT's Magyar RTL and Swedish-Hungarian consortium MTM-SBS. ORTT announced on June 30 that the ten-year concessions were awarded to Magyar RTL and MTM-SBS. The CLT-led consortium, Magyar RTL, is owned by a consortium of CLT-UFA, Raiffeisen Unicbank, the UK Pearson group , publisher of the Financial Times, and Hungarian telecom company Matav. MTM-SBS is a consortium of the Hungarian-registered company MTM Kommunikacios Rt, TeleMunchen and the majority US-owned company Scandinavian Broadcasting System. Magyar RTL offered 9 billion forints for the commercial channel it won, while MTM-SBS offered the set minimum of 8 billion forints for the other commercial channel. Irisz TV, a consortium led by Central European Media Enterprises of the U.S., which offered 12.5 billion and 12 billion forints for the two channels but failed in both bids, said  on Monday it was challenging the decision and asked a court to forbid the signing of the concession contracts. It said the ORTT had seriously breached the regulations when assessing the bids and violated the tender procedures and earlier on Wednesday it announced it had a "public document" proving that one of the winning tenders was illegal. ORTT Chairman Mihaly Revesz said after the signing he had no comment on the statement and added the case would be settled in court. "I haven't seen (the statement) and I don't have any comment especially as this is an ongoing legal process," Revesz told Reuters. The eight-member ORTT board chose the winning bidders after two rounds of deliberation and said at the time of the decision that one important factor in the decision was the future diversity of Hungary's media scene and that the verdict was unanimous but for one abstention. The franchises are for ten years that can be extended by another five without the need for a second tender. The two television channels will have to start broadcasting on October 7 latest. The decision brought to an end seven years of political wrangling which has left Hungary's media privatisation trailing behind other former communist countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic, which already have commercial national television stations.
MCAT	Pakistani cotton rates closed steady on Monday on low buying by spinners but they were expected to rise in the next few days on demand from exporters, dealers at the private Karachi Cotton Association (KCA) said. One dealer said spinners had slowed buying as they had enough stocks to last until the new crop arrives in early July in Sindh province, where it ripens earlier than in Punjab province. In the kerb market, NIAB-78 variety was quoted at 2,100/2,175 rupees per maund (37.32 kg), K-68 at 2,350/2,375 and MNH-93 at 2,380/2,400.
GCAT	The trial of a pool mechanic charged in the gas poisoning of tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis began Tuesday with his attorney blaming the maker of a pool heating system and describing his client as a "scapegoat." Prosecutors have alleged that mechanic Bartholomew Torpey and his employer, East End Pools and Courts Inc., improperly rigged an exhaust pipe in the basement of a Southampton, Long Island, pool cottage where Gerulaitis slept. Gerulaitis, 40, was found dead Sept. 18, 1994, on the exclusive estate of developer friend Martin Raynes. Torpey was accused of failing to install the correct length of pipe from a pool heating system, trapping carbon monoxide gas near the room where Gerulaitis rested. Torpey was indicted on charges of criminally negligent homicide and the pool company was charged with second degree manslaughter. In opening arguments Tuesday in Torpey's trial in Suffolk County Court, attorney David Clayton charged that prosecutors, by allowing a key expert witness from manufacturer Teledyne Lars to testify before a grand jury, had given the expert immunity from prosecution. "In this case the District Attorney and the city let the big people take a hike and went after the smallest people on the face of the earth he could find," Clayton told the jury. He described Torpey as the "fall guy" and a "scapegoat". Clayton blamed Teledyne Lars and the expert witness, James Cosmano, whom he said was the last person in the pool cottage to work on the heater three days before Gerulaitis' death. Gerulaitis, who retired from the tennis circuit in 1984 but later returned to the game as a broadcaster, won 27 singles and nine doubles championships, including the 1977 Australian Open. He won millions of dollars but his career declined rapidly as he was treated for drug abuse. During his opening arguments, Assistant District Attorney Edward Helig slammed his hand down on the defence table and said, "the buck stops at this table right here. They're the people who did it, the people responsible for it." He told the jury that Torpey was not educated enough and did not care enough to make sure the pipe extended outside of the door. "When you see one item, the photograph of how this defendant installed and vented this heater, you don't need to be an expert to see the photograph and know and say 'that's wrong'," Helig said. "He just didn't care enough, didn't take the time to find out how to vent this thing." Gerulaitis' mother Aldona Gerulaitis has filed a $63 million civil lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court, citing nine defendants, including Torpey, the pool company and Raynes.
GCAT	South Africans Ernie Els and Wayne Westner romped to a record 18-shot World Cup victory on Sunday. They smashed the previous best winning margin of 14 strokes set by Ben Hogan and Sam Snead in 1956 and equalled by Fred Couples and Davis Love III in 1994 and 1995. World matchplay champion Els did not ease up even though the pair carried a 13-stroke advantage into the final round. He closed with a 67 to finish 16-under and also carried off the International Trophy as leading individual. Westner finished three back in second place after a 70. It was only the fifth occasion in the tournament's 42-year history that the winning team have staged a one-two in the individual rankings. South Africa also became only the seventh team to lead the event throughout. Low round of the tournament and final day was claimed by Ireland's Darren Clarke who shot a 64 despite a double bogey six at the 10th hole. The South Afriucan duo shared the $400,000 first prize with Els collecting an additional $100,000 for his individual success. "It's been an unbelievable week for me," Els said. "I have won one major but this comes very close to it. The feeling walking up the 18th was incredible -- to win a tournament like this playing in front of your home crowd in the way we did is really satisfying." Scotland were unable to hold off the challenge of the United States, finishing third on 10-under as Tom Lehman and Steve Jones improved by five shots on the final day to finish on 11-under. Els added: "We had to stay pretty focused today having such a big lead. Situations like this can change very rapidly." Westner said: "All we had to do today was play conservative golf but Ernie went ballistic again. I'm a bit older so I was more conservative. "It was an honour and a privilege to play with Ernie for four days -- there's no weakness in his game and he's so relaxed he makes it very easy."

GCAT	A Japan-South Korea summit meeting had a stormy start on Saturday as Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was forced to apologise for inflammatory remarks by his spokesman about Tokyo's use of sex slaves in World War Two. Noisy protests by hundreds of ultra rightwingers against President Kim Youg-sam's visit added to the tension at the one-day meeting which had been intended to showcase the good relations between the two countries. Other issues of national pride at stake include competing claims for islands. The rightwingers drove 150 trucks with loudspeakers through this resort loudly denouncing "unreasonable South Koreans demands" for Japan to apologise for World War Two actions. Hashimoto was on the defensive from the moment the summit opened because of remarks by Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama that there was a "social background" to Tokyo's use of sex slaves, or so-called "comfort women", in the war. About 200,000 captured comfort women from Korea, the Philippines, China, Indonesia and the Netherlands were forced to work in front-line brothels in one of the darkest chapters of Japan's World War Two past. "It is odd teaching them (Japanese schoolchildren) of the comfort women issue, without teaching the social background of an authorised prostitution system at that time," Kajiyama, the government's top spokesman, said on Friday. "When they (comfort women) went to the fronts, they got money. Among them, there were some who were drafted," he added in remarks made only to Japanese reporters but later reluctantly confirmed by shocked Japanese officials. In an opening summit lunch, Hashimoto wasted no time in distancing himself from the comments. "On the issue of comfort women, I am worried about the impact of reported remarks by Chief Cabinet Secretary Kajiyama," Hashimoto told Kim. "I am sorry. That (view) is not our real intention." Repeating remarks he made in a summit meeting in South Korea with Kim last June, Hashimoto said there was no way for Japan to defend itself on the comfort women issue. "At no other time has women's honour and dignity been hurt more than in this case," Hashimoto said. Kim, already angry at the rightwingers reception, told Hashimoto South Koreans were outraged by Kajiyama's remarks. "The timing of the reported remarks is unfortunate. Explanations must be given to satisfy the Korean people who were shocked by the remarks," Kim told Hashimoto. "This issue is very sensitive on the part of the Korean people." A decades-long row over Japan's failure to fully apologise and pay official compensation to the women flared again earier this month when the Asian Women's Fund, a private group set up in 1995 with heavy Japanese government support, paid money to seven ageing Korean women. South Korea does not want government-to-government compensastion but believes Tokyo should compensate the sex slaves directly. The island ownership issue is equally emotive. Japan calls the two small islands Takeshima and South Korea calls them Tokto. They are surrounded by rich fishing grounds. Tokyo has claimed the islands since it started its 1905 colonial rule of Korea. South Koreans say they have owned the islands for centuries.

MCAT	A resurgence of demand from importers taking advantage of a strong Kenyan shilling weakened the currency marginally on Wednesday, commercial bank dealers said. The Central Bank of Kenya posted a commercial mean of 53.06 against the dollar, compared with 52.96 on Tuesday, while against the pound it was posted at a mean of 86.75 from 86.50. "The demand was sudden and under normal circumstances would not have moved rates, it's just that right now, the market is extremely sensitive," one dealer from a leading bank said. Dealers said the fact the central bank had indicated it would keep out of the market and allow rates to find their levels of equilibrium had made them nervous about maintaining long dollar positions without a buyer of last resort. "Over the last three days, we've kept a spread of 30 cents, which shows they're slightly anxious," one dealer said. Some dealers expressed concern that a strong shilling would hurt exporters and the shilling was overvalued at current levels. But a senior central bank official told Reuters the bank believed that given economic fundamentals, the shilling was still very undervalued. Dealers said they saw any demand as an opportunity for the shilling to correct itself and retrace its steps to 54. The money market remained tight with overnight rates quoted at 20 percent levels unchanged. --Wambui Chege, Nairobi Newsroom ++254-2 330-261

CCAT	The people behind "The Unexplained" have some explaining to do. This CD-ROM (FlagTower, Windows, $30), a recent example of someone trying to make a buck off the pseudo-mysteries of the "supernatural," invites you to "examine the evidence" and then neglects to provide key pieces of information to help you understand what's really going on. It talks about spoons supposedly bent by mental energy and a photograph allegedly created with thought waves, never explaining how such tricks are done by sleight of hand. One of my favourite supernatural topics is dowsing -- the alleged ability to find water, gold, missing persons, and just about anything using a forked stick, a couple of bent coat hangers, or a pendulum. The scientific research is overwhelming: it doesn't work. The psychology behind dowsing, particularly why people believe in it so fiercely, is fascinating. "The Unexplained" makes the dowsing issue seem far more open to debate than it really is. On the one hand, "The Unexplained" treats dowsing as real, stating at one point that the U.S. Marine Corps is "quite open about their use of the talent to detect dangerous sites," a highly questionable claim and one that the programme never bothers to document. In some cases, the folks at FlagTower do something that the supernatural TV special and tabloid talk shows don't do -- offer at least a smidgen of scepticism. The dowsing section, for example, describes a test by the British military where dowsers failed miserably when they tried to located defused mines. It also states that false memories, suggestibility, and hoaxes may be responsible for some UFO reports. There's a huge prize (currently over $740,000) for anyone who can demonstrate paranormal powers without using luck or fraud. (The challenge is outlined on the World Wide Web at www.randi.org/jr/chall.html.) A savvy consumer should question why none of the people on this CD-ROM who claim extraordinary powers have earned the money.     -   -   -   - From trepanation (the ancient practice of drilling holes in the head to cure headaches, epilepsy and mental illness) to organ transplants, FlagTower's "A History of Medicine" (Windows, $30) looks at the illnesses, discoveries and people who have shaped contemporary medicine. The presentation is entertaining and interesting. It has a section on the Hammurabi Code, which was the first attempt to regulate doctors and ordered that a surgeon who saved the life of a lord must be handsomely rewarded, unless the lord died (in which case his hand would be cut). This early form of managed care prevented a lot of unnecessary operations. Another section explains how the Hebrews pioneered the science of public health with their sanitation rules. Unfortunately, "A History of Medicine" falls for much of the propaganda surrounding "alternative" medicine, stating that practitioners who use "complementary" therapies "stress that disorders are not the product of a single cause but an accumulation of factors: inherited predispositions, diet, emotional state, an individual's way of life and abuses such as alcohol and cigarettes." The truth is, that's the underlying philosophy of "established" medicine these days. Yet though the programme seems unwilling to assess questionable medical claims, it offers a nice discussion of medical quackery. "A History of Medicine" ends up being a mixed bag. If you're going to embrace its information in large doses, I prescribe a grain of salt.     -   -   -   - Some new and notable software in the stores this week: "Rama" (Sierra, Windows95/DOS, $55) is based on the series of novels originated by science fiction author Arthur C.

MCAT	European debt futures are doomed to fail in any attempt to chart new highs before the year is out, technical analysts said on Friday. A sharp sell-off, sparked by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, inflicted some serious damage to technical analysts' price charts, leaving the outlook bleak until early 1997. "There is a serious correction going on, and we've seen some heavy technical damage," said Guenter Redeker, a chartist at Chase in London. "This implies that for the next four weeks we will definitely not see new highs in the market." Just days after debt futures across Europe powered to fresh all-time highs, a warning from Greenspan that financial markets were showing signs of "irrational exuberance" sent bond prices plummeting early on Friday. German Bund futures plunged 86 basis points at the open, shadowing a 1-1/2 point fall in the U.S. long bond overnight. French notionnel futures cracked through a medium term upchannel, leaving a large gap on daily price charts and signalling more weakness ahead, while March gilt futures also tumbled through technical supports. Analysts said it was still too early to tell whether 1997 would be a year for bond bears or bulls, but said charts showed that a rally into the end of this year was pretty much out of the question. "The jury is still out on the overall trend, but for the rest of December we've done some pretty heavy damage and are going to struggle a bit," said Karl Haeling, director of futures and options for Germany at DMG Futures and Options in Frankfurt. Coming so close to the end of the year, Haeling said Friday's stinging fall would prompt players to get out of the market, taking their profits for the year while they could. "Few buyers are going to step up and take on more risk. People will be looking for any upmove, saying "hey here's my chance to get out'," he said. In Bund futures, Europe's benchmark market, Chase's Redeker said 100.08 was a key retracement level. The March Bund contract was trading at 100.00 by 1122 GMT, down 70 basis points on the day. "If the market can stabilise and manage to close above 100.08 today, then I would start looking for a bottom building process," he said. But after such a sharp setback, the market will need time to consolidate. "It will take a period for the market to build a solid platform," said Redeker. If Bunds failed to hold above that level, the risk was for more profound weakness, with downside targets at 99.75 and 99.00 luring the contract lower, chartists said. In T-bonds, where the technical pain came hot on the heels of Greenspan's words and swiftly infected European markets, chartists said an important pattern on weekly price charts was the key to the outlook. "We've had an outside week. That means the market is rejecting the upside," said Gerry Celaya, senior technical analyst at American Express Bank in London. An outside week pattern occurs when charts show a higher high and a lower low than were plotted in the previous week. March T-bond futures, trading in automated business before the U.S. market opens, were more than one full point lower at 113-06 by 1123 GMT. Technical analysts said 112-09 was a critical level for this market, since it represented a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from early September at 105-14, to Tuesday's high at 116-17. If that level is broken, more sharp declines are on the cards for U.S. debt futures, with T-bonds on the road to 110-23, chartists said.

ECAT	Life in Australia is pretty good. The sun shines most of the year. The beaches are clean, and official data shows Australia boasts bigger gross domestic product (GDP) growth than many other developed nations. But a debate has emerged over just to measure that success. Is GDP the best indicator of Australia's development? Does it take into account, for example, the environment impact of economic expansion? Does it measure the cost of unemployment? A number of economic forecasters believe current statistics stop short of providing a true picture of Australia's standard of living. In fact, the government's Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) plans to issue a new measure of lifestyle. Real GDP per person in Australia increased steadily from about A$9,000 ($6,660) in 1950 to more than A$23,000 in 1996, said Clive Hamilton executive director of the Australia Institute, a Canberra-based think tank. Such a rise in GDP is usually interpreted as showing that Australians have become progressively better off. NEW MEASURE OF SUCCESS But according to Hamilton, the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) developed by the Australia Institute, which includes 23 other variables covering social and environmental factors, shows Australians are not so much better off. Hamilton said starting from A$9,000 in 1950, the GPI rises to A$16,000 in 1996, lower than the comparative GDP figure, reflecting growing costs of unemployment, higher levels of foreign debt and increased costs of environmental damage. "The cost of environmental damage is over A$3,000 per person each year in Australia," said Hamilton, adding that this was one of the reasons why the GPI average was lower than the GDP average over the past 46 years. "GDP was not and never intended to be a measure of national welfare," said Roger Beale, secretary of the department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. Beale said his department was looking at plans to issue a range of data on the environment to reflect Australia's water quality, the rate of soil erosion and extent of air pollution. "We are pushing along a suite of environmental indicators to help us measure whether or not our environment is improving or going backwards," Beale told Reuters. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS The Australia Institute's Hamilton said the cost of climate change amounted to about A$14.7 billion in 1996, land degradation A$4.51 billion, air pollution A$6.58 billion and urban water pollution A$3.58 billion. The cost of environmental damage has started to affect Australia significantly for about 20 years, these figures show. "The reason why things have not been getting any better since the late 1970s are because of the impact of these environmental damages," Hamilton said. The ABS said it expects to make an announcement soon on how it should improve its monitoring of the country's social and environmental progress. "What we are looking at is a multi-dimensional indicator, in which you are looking at the economic development, the social development, environmental development; they are all linked and what you need is a multi-dimensional approach to the problem and the ABS is working through this," said Dennis Trewin, deputy statistician at the ABS. Trewin said a multi-dimensional indicator would be released through a series of indicators that reflect social and environmental changes such as resource depletion or the amount of money spent correcting environmental damage. The ABS has increased the amount of data released on the environment recently. In June 1996, the bureau published for the first time a scorecard on Australia's environment in a report called Australians and the Environment. THE BROADER VIEW The Australia Institute's Hamilton said they had modified the GPI, an idea that was developed in the United States, for Australia and could only be issued once a year due to the information required. "This is not a substitution for GDP. GDP is a very good measure for short-term macro-economic management. GPI is a wider, longer-term measure of well being," Hamilton said. "With the GPI, we have factored in things like the cost of overwork as well as the cost of unemployment." Hamilton added there was a need to issue broader data than the GDP figure because it would help governments make policies that reflected the state of the relevant economic, social and environment indicators. "If we fail to go beyond GDP then, in the words of the United Nations Development Programme, we will continue to navigate with a faulty instrument," Hamilton told a conference on measuring national progress in Canberra recently.

ECAT	August consumer price inflation that was even less subdued than expected, combined with very modest retail sales activity during the month, has called into question the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase later this month, economists said. While economists had expected consumer prices to be up 0.2 percent in August and for that Consumer Price Index (CPI) without its food and energy items to be up 0.2 percent as well, the government reported instead that the CPI and the core CPI each rose just a very slight 0.1 percent.   The two reports spurred a rally in the bond market, which is fearful that the economy is not slowing sufficiently in the second half of the year to keep interest rates from rising. The bond market fears strong growth and the inflation that growth can typically engender because inflation devalues outstanding bonds. After the data were released, the 6-3/4 percent 30-year bond, which was down 5/32 and yielding 7.07 percent in nervous trade, climbed more than a full point to 97-05/32. Its yield fell back below seven percent to 6.98 percent.   "This is very important because it's taking the Fed out of action for the September meeting," said Patrick Dimick, Treasury market analyst at CS First Boston. "It allows the Fed to be staring at a low unemployment rate and say it's ok because it's not going any lower. It provides them with an excuse to endure a low unemployment rate." Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent in August, the lowest rate in more than seven years. Other economists questioned whether the data was certain to keep the Federal Reserve from raising rates in September.   "I don't think (the CPI and retail sales data are) enough to prevent a Fed rate hike, but that's the hope that is clearly in the market right now," said David Blitzer, chief economist at Standard and Poor's, told Reuters Financial Television. "(The) CPI shows you (that) at the retail level ... you are not seeing any meaningful upward pressures," said Kevin Flanagan, first vice president and money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Pretty much any way you slice it, (the August 0.1 percent CPI) is a positive figure; it ... will probably be welcomed by the Federal Reserve."   Waldo Best, senior economist at BZW Securities Inc, said Friday's data were "definitely more favorable for the bond market than expected and that's why the market's moving very fast here." But Best said he did not think the data provided "a justification for why the Fed may hold off in September." Best called the CPI a lagging indicator "so it's not so much of a reason for them to not raise rates in September as (it is a confirmation that) they were doing the right thing six to nine months ago."   After the data, the Treasury yield curve steepened with the spread between two-year-note and 30-year-bond yields widening to 86 basis points from 80 basis points at Thursday's close and in early trade on Friday. While the chance of a Fed tightening is never completely out of the market, the Treasury market has priced in a below-50 percent chance that the central banks will raise rates, said CS First Boston's Dimick. -- 212-859-1679

"Our strategy is not to take control of Suez, but to accompany its chairman's strategy," Electrafina said. Electrafina already had an 8.3 percent capital stake in Suez. The purchase boosted its stake in Suez to 11.35 percent, but as some French shares have double voting rights, GBL's voting share in Suez is only just over 10 percent, a GBL official told Reuters. The statement also said that the nomination of an Electrafina representative on the Suez board will be proposed at the next meeting of Suez shareholders. -- Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6810, Fax +32 2 230 7710
MCAT	KCBT hard red winter wheat futures settled mostly higher on bullish export data and persistent concerns about dry weather in western Kansas, traders said. Dry wheat growing areas in western Kansas may receive scattered showers late this weekend or next week, but the long-term outlook for that area remains dry, meteorologists said. "The market is at the point where it knows it's either 20 cents too high or 10 cents too cheap, and it will know which way to go after this weekend's weather," a KCBT trader said. Traders said volumes were light late in the session as the market awaited private forecasts for weekend weather. Traders cited USDA's weekly export sales report as another source of support. USDA said net combined old and new crop export sales during the week ended May 8 totaled 705,500 tonnes, exceeding expectations of 350,000 to 500,000 tonnes. Firm cash basis markets underpinned the nearby May contract, adding strength to the May/July spread. KCBT wheat settled 1/2 cent per bushel lower to 13 cents higher, with May up 13 cents at $4.68. July was up 2-3/4 cents at $4.19. ((--Greg Frost, 816 561-8671))
GCAT	Afghanistan's Islamic Taleban militia appeared on Thursday to have suffered reverses at the hands of ousted army chief Ahmad Shah Masood, with a town south of previous fighting being prepared for assault. The Taleban were setting up anti-aircraft guns in the middle of the main road through Charikar, 60 km (40 miles) north of Kabul, which they took two weeks ago. The nearby village of Bagram, next to Kabul's military airport, was deserted but the base was still in Taleban hands. Shops in Charikar were closed and nervous local people on the streets said they heard small arms fire an estimated five km (three miles) north of the town on the road to Jabal-os-Siraj at the mouth of the Salang Pass, where Masood's men attacked on Tuesday and drove the Taleban back. In mid-afternoon, however, there was no sign of fighting in or around Charikar. But local people said they had seen many Taleban, dead and wounded, being ferried south towards Kabul. Other reports appeared to confirm the Taleban's opponents were on the move. U.N. sources in Islamabad, Pakistan, said Masood's forces attacked Taleban fighters at his old headquarters at Jabal os-Siraj and moved south to threaten the airbase. "All we know is that Masood has moved out of the Panjsher Valley, had a go at the Taleban in Jabal os-Siraj and Charikar, and has moved on Bagram," a U.N. source said. Earlier, travellers said the sound of heavy fighting was apparent just north of Jabal-os-Siraj, a 30-minute drive from Charikar, but there was no word on whether the town at the foot of the wall of the Hindu Kush had fallen. "It was very close to Jabal-os-Siraj," said one traveller who asked not to be identified. A Taleban source in Pakistan denied that Jabal os-Siraj had fallen, saying Taleban fighters had killed four of Masood's men and captured 47 in fighting there on Thursday. On Wednesday, the front line of the Taleban was 15 km (nine miles) north of the town, witnesses said. That was 15 to 20 km (nine to 12 miles) south of their front line before Masood's men launched a suprise attack on Tuesday. Confirmation of the reports was not immediately available. Western reporters were barred from travelling to the area. On Tuesday, the Taleban battlefield commander in the Salang, Maulavi Khairulla Haqani, told Reuters Television his men had stemmed the advance of Masood's ethnic Tajik fighters down the Salang. He said fighting had been fierce, but declined to comment on casualties. Western aid workers, however, quoted witnesses as saying they had seen at least 100 Taleban bodies and many more wounded being taken to Jabal-os-Siraj. The attack forced the Taleban, who have swept to control of three-quarters of Afghanistan since the movement was born in religious schools in refugee camps in Pakistan two years ago, to break off attempts to enter Masood's Panjsher valley fortress. They started the assault on Saturday, but by Wednesday evening not a single black-turbanned Taleban fighter was to be seen in Golbahar, a town 10 km (six miles) east of Jabal that sits astride the rocky gorge leading into the Panjsher. Days of heavy fighting had taken Taleban fighters only 500 metres (yards) into the gorge, which Masood blocked with landslides. In the Salang, there was no word on casualties among Masood's men, led by his former area commander, Basir Solangi, in an attack that cut off a large number of Taleban fighters, the aid workers said. When the largely ethnic Pushtun Taleban moved north after taking Kabul, Solangi retreated north into territory controlled by Uzbek chief Abdul Rashid Dostum, who talked with ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani this week and said Masood was to join them. Also in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, from which Dostum controls six of Afghanistan's provinces, was Karim Khallili, leader of the Hezb-i-Wahadat faction which controls territory to the west of Jabal-os-Siraj. The Taleban leadership in Kabul dismissed any possibility of an alliance between the groups, which have been enemies in the past.

GCAT	Hong Kong governor Chris Patten leaves for London on Wednesday for meetings with the British foreign secretary and other officials, government radio reported on Sunday. Patten was also expected to hold talks with British Prime Minister John Major during the trip, Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) said. Patten will be giving evidence to the House of Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee, the report said. The trip could be Pattens' last before the British general election, which must be held before May, two months before Hong Kong itself reverts to Chinese rule.
MCAT	After a year stuck in the doldrums since its postwar reopening, the Beirut Stock Exchange is starting to show signs of increased activity as Lebanese interest rates drop and new bank shares liven up the market. Beirut stockbrokers say local and Arab investors are beginnning to show interest in shares as yields plunge on government treasury bills, which have soaked up private investment for the past four years, and newly-listed Beirut bank stocks offer healthy returns. Volume has just about doubled to nearly $2 million on a busy day on the Beirut bourse since the first two banks listed in December and January -- enough for traders to proclaim the first signs of a turnround on the market. "I think the process of investor interest in the stock exchange has begun. It's inevitable," said Alain Balian, a deputy manager at Lebanon Invest finance house. "Obviously falling interest rates cool interest in t-bills and among educated investors the banking sector is very attractive. "Banks have been making good money and everyone wants to get in on the game," Balian told Reuters. Yields on Lebanese three-month to two-year t-bills have dropped since November to a range of 13.87-16.18 percent from 14.56-21.58 percent and are still falling. Banks are also reducing interest rates sharply. Heavy demand for the two listed bank shares has encouraged Beirut stockbrokers. "It's only a small beginning, but it's good because it is a beginning," said Nabil Aoun, head of Fidus brokerage house, and a member of the stock exchange committee. Before the bank listings the only regular trade on the bourse was in Solidere, the real estate company rebuilding central Beirut, whose shares have performed disappointingly since a dramatic debut in 1994. Shares of the first bank to list, Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce, have risen 12 percent since their December 30 debut although the bank is not among Lebanon's top 10. BLC's performance has been outclassed by Banque Audi, a leading Beirut bank, whose shares have risen 15 percent in a month since their January 20 debut. Aoun said Fidus was taking more than $1 million in daily orders for Audi from Lebanese and Arab investors. Two more banks plan to list soon -- Bank of Beirut, which ranked 16th in 1996 in size of deposits among Lebanon's 82 banks, and Byblos Bank, one of the most dynamic in the country. Byblos this week reported a 60 percent 1996 rise in profits and brokers say its shares are shooting up in pre-listing trade on the grey market, nearing $6 from $2.60 two years ago. "Byblos will be a star on the stock exchange. It has a good record, clever management strategy and record profits for the past three or four years," said a banker. Listings by hotel and insurance companies are expected soon to diversify the market further. Alain Balian at Lebanon Invest said Societe des Grands Hotels du Liban, which is rebuilding Beirut's 572-room Phoenicia Intercontinental and has already reopened the 90-room Vendome Intercontinental, is making preparations to list its shares. Market sources say two insurance companies are also preparing to list, one of them possibly this year. So far, however, the Beirut stock market is extremely small. Capitalisation is $2.4 billion and investors have only seven shares to choose from -- two banks, four cement or industrial companies, and Solidere, which itself accounts for about $2.1 billion of the capitalisation. The cement and industrial companies are rarely traded on the exchange. Brokers cite their lack of transparency but say there is a lot more trading in their stocks on the grey market. Solidere's lacklustre performance, despite good 1996 results and progress in operations, puzzles some Beirut stockbrokers, particularly as Merrill Lynch reported in January the stocks were trading at a 43 percent discount to Net Asset Value. "The fundamentals are not driving the price....Fundamentally I think it's a good stock to buy, yet the price is not moving. It doesn't make sense," Balian said.
CCAT	The most extensive oil and gas exploration conducted off the shores of Cambodia yielded no commercially viable wells, exploration firms said on Tuesday. Representatives of Enterprise Oil and Cambodia Petroleum Exploration Co Ltd (Campex) said the disappointing results from four wells drilled in 1996 meant they must now pin their hopes further offshore. They said they were eyeing the Overlapping Claim Area (OCA), a 26,400 square-km central section of the Gulf of Thailand that both Cambodia and Thailand claim to control. "The results are not as good as we hoped (off the Cambodian coast). This makes the OCA more important than ever," Enterprise exploration manager Hugh G.D. Mackay told Reuters. Enterprise, which explored on behalf of its partners British Gas and France's Total, conducted drilling at three wells in 1996 and a fourth well in 1994, said Mackay. The more than $55-million exploration project included extensive seismic tests, he said. "This was very thorough, a very aggressive drilling campaign and a fairly thorough evaluation of our two blocks...but it does look as if the reserves fall below the economic threshold, which is disappointing."   Yoshiro Sasaki, general manager of Campex, a subsidiary of Japan Petroleum Exploration Co Ltd (JAPEX), told Reuters exploration of one well late this year and two in 1993 and 1994 had produced similar results. "We found some oil, but not enough for commercial operations," he said. "Now, everyone is waiting to see about the OCA." The OCA has been disputed for more than two decades. Thailand awarded concessions to the waters in the 1970s, and Cambodia is now evaluating bids for the area. Analysts say that once Cambodia awards its concessions -- a move government officials say will even out the playing field in negotiations with the Thai government -- stalled talks between the two nations may finally move forward. "We hope to award the concessions soon," said a member of a Cambodian interministerial committee charged with evaluating the bids. "We just need to meet and finalise our decision." But analysts say it could easily be another year before Cambodia awards the concessions and many more years before the two countries agree on ownership of the waters. Enterprise and Campex, who have both submitted bids for the OCA, believe the area could prove rich in reserves.   "That's the area where Cambodia has the best chance of generating oil and gas revenue," Mackay said of the OCA. He said he hoped Enterprise's large investment in Cambodia would increase the company's chances of tapping the OCA. "We hope our major commitment we have showed the government will be taken into account," he said, adding that Enterprise "has no intention of shutting down here".

CCAT	Vietnam's Ministry of Transport is considering plans to build a special rice port in the Can Gio district of Ho Chi Minh City, the official Ha Noi Moi daily said on Saturday. It said the $20 million port, which would have capacity to handle 3.75 million tonnes of rice a year, would include a special area for processing and storage. Major roads link the southern city to the country's main rice-growing area, the Mekong Delta. Vietnam was the world's fourth largest exporter of rice last year, selling 2.025 million tonnes abroad. In the first eight months of this year it exported 1.9 million tonnes. The Ministry of Agriculture has asked the government to sanction an increase in this year's export quota to 2.3-2.5 million tonnes from 2.0 million. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) told Reuters last month that Vietnam could earn $40-50 million a year more from selling rice abroad if it improved market management and liberalised its export regime.
CCAT	Pocket Communications Inc., a wireless personal communications services (PCS) operator, said it voluntarily sought bankruptcy protection Monday after defaulting on $80 million in loans. Privately held Pocket had bid $1.4 billion in the auctions for entrepreurial operators held by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission last November for for its licenses and has paid the FCC more than $140 million. The company had one license covering 35 million potential U.S. customers in markets such as Chicago, Detroit, Dallas-Ft. Worth, St. Louis, New Orleans, Las Vegas and Honolulu.   Pocket officials said they filed for court protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division. In a phone interview, Dan Riker, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the company voluntarily chose to file for bankruptcy to protect its assets against a group of creditors to which it had defaulted on $80 million in loans. The creditors include a group of Asian entrepreneurs and telecom equipment makers Siemens AG and Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, the executive said.   Pocket was one of several top bidders in last year's PCS auctions that have buckled under the strain of interest payments required by the FCC to pay for the PCS licenses. Pocket, NextWave Telecom Inc., which bid $4.7 billion, and several other winners had asked regulators for a more lenient timetable in which to repay the bids, which have become loans from the government on which the bidders pay interest. The companies had asked for an annual repayment schedule instead of a quarterly one. Pocket said it filed for bankruptcy to satisfy short-term financing requirements and to initiate a restructuring plan.   Pocket had previously secured commitments for more than $646 million in financing to build out its PCS networks from equipment vendors including Ericsson, Siemens' Stromberg-Carlson unit and Northern Telecom Ltd. It said it had completed deals with Ericsson and Northern Telecom for $481 million of that financing. However, Riker said Pocket's financing plans had hinged on an initial public offering planned for last fall, which had to be postponed due to delays in the FCC auction process. A second shot at an IPO in January fell apart when Wall Street soured on initial offerings in the wireless sector.   Analysts forecast a shakeout in the industry as a host of new players engage in a city-by-city battle for market share with established cellular incumbents typically owned by cash-heavy regional Bell companies and long-distance carriers. Riker said the company views the filing as a temporary measure to ensure its long-term viability. He forecast that the reorganization process would take several months before it can emerge from Chapter 11 on firm financial footing. Referring to the bankruptcy protection, he said that, "If there was no waiver, the creditors would have had a right to seize the collateral," or PCS licenses it holds.   Pocket said it has about $1 billion in assets -- largely the value of its wireless liceneses -- and about $1.5 billion in liabilities -- largely the long-term debt owed to the FCC. The company has begun construction of PCS networks in its Las Vegas and Honolulu markets and has switching equipment and local management in place there. Riker said Pocket's financial troubles would delay the launch of its services. "We think (autumn) is probably the time frame," he told Reuters. The company said it had applied to the Bankruptcy Court for authority to hire the law firm of Whiteford, Taylor & Preston as its bankruptcy counsel, and Perkins Coie as general corporate counsel. Pocket is based in Washington. Brightpoint Inc, an Indianopolis-based provider of retail packaging and fulfillment services for many cellular phone providers, has invested $5 million in Pocket. Riker started Pocket in 1993 after 12 years with MCI Communications Corp, where his jobs included heading the company's cellular business before it was sold to McCaw Cellular.

MCAT	NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures ended lower Thursday in an active session, pressured by a deteriorating technical picture and eroding cash prices amid mostly-mild U.S. weather, industry sources said. November tumbled nine cents to close at $2.485 per million British thermal units. December settled 12 cents lower at $2.556. Other deferreds ended down by 3.5 to 12.1 cents. "Natgas is becoming a weather play, and right now, warmer temperatures are expected and there's not going to be any load in the Northeast," said one Midwest trader, noting physical prices lost more than a dime today.   Traders said forecasts calling for mostly seasonal to above-seasonal U.S. weather into early November set a bearish tone ahead of bidweek next week. And with reports of some East Coast utilities already turning back gas, few expected much upside in cash or futures near-term though most agreed the approach of an uncertain winter should temper the bears. Technically, traders noted December settled below the near-term up trendline, making a move to next support in the $2.46-47 area likely. Resistance was seen at the recent $2.76 high. Cash sources said Gulf Coast prices skidded almost a dime Thursday to about the $2.50 level. Midcon pipes were down a similar amount to the mid-$2.30s. New York city gate gas prices, pressured by mild East Coast weather, fell about 15 cents to the low-$2.80 area. The 12-month Henry Hub strip fell 7.8 cents to $2.207.

CCAT	Ingwe Coal Corporation earnings are expected to have steamed ahead in the wake of the rand's depreciation last year, analysts said on Tuesday. A Reuters poll of six analysts forecast earnings would jump 63 percent to 173 cents a share in the six months to December 31 from 106 cents in the same period a year ago. The average was drawn from a range of 160 to 200 cents. The dividend was expected to come in at between 45 and 70 cents from 35 cents previously and the average forecast was 56.8 cents. "The main thing is the depreciation of the rand," said Societe Generale Frankel Pollak analyst Ross Gardner. "Coal companies are highly geared towards the rand and any depreciation materialises very quickly in coal exports," he said. The rand sank almost 30 percent against the dollar last year and depreciated by 23 percent on a trade-weighted basis. Analysts said other factors that might contribute to the expected improvement in earnings included a possible reduction in working costs. "They should get a bit from cost control because they have been pushing for it on the mines," an analyst said. An increase in export tonnage was also cited as a possible contributing factor. The company will release interim results on February 13. -- Paul Richardson, Johannesburg newsroom, +27 11 482-1003
GCAT	A hand grenade exploded outside a Budapest nightclub early on Wednesday in the latest in a series of bombings that police blame on a gangland turf war. The explosion shortly after 5 a.m. outside the Leroy Country Pub restaurant in the Hungarian capital blew out the windows of two parked cars but caused no casualties, police said. The bombing follows a spate of blasts outside nightclubs and restaurants and the murder earlier this month of a prominent Budapest gang leader. Jozsef Prisztas was shot at point-blank range with a 9mm handgun while sitting in his jeep. Police subsequently raided Budapest nightclubs, detaining scores of people. The Hungarian National Police have set up a 137-strong task force to deal with the gang war.

ECAT	The Treasury Department's groundbreaking auction of securities designed to protect against the ravages of inflation were brought to an eager market Wednesday. The $7 billion sale of 10-year inflation-indexed notes, carrying a coupon interest rate of 3.375 percent, drew strong bidding that resulted in a high yield rate of 3.449 percent, well under estimates, so that the government was able to borrow more cheaply than anticipated. "We think this is a very good start to the programme that is going to be very big," said Roger Anderson, the Treasury Department's deputy assistant secretary for domestic finance, who helped design and oversaw introduction of the new borrowing instrument. Treasury notes are like savings bonds, but generally cover shorter periods of time. The new notes, sold in minimum denominations of $1,000, will have their principal value adjusted daily based on changes in the widely used Consumer Price Index. Thus, the principal will not be eroded away by rising prices by the time it matures in 2007, as can happen with conventional debt securities. In addition, it offers coupon interest of 3.375 percent, paying half that amount each six months on the then-current principal value. The effect is that, for the first time, an investor is fully protected from rising prices and gets a real, inflation-adjusted return of the amount promised when the security was sold. One measure of the first issue's popularity was the bid-to-cover ratio, which measures the bids received for the notes against those sold. The ratio was 5.31, with $37.2 billion of bids pouring in for the $7 billion of available notes. "We saw overwhelming demand at the last minute," said Scott Graham, a New York-based trader at Prudential Securities Inc. While the bid-to-cover ratio was described as excellent, bidding by individuals appeared to be fairly modest. The Treasury Department reported only $157 million of so-called "non-competitive bids," which generally come from individual buyers. Dealers were apparently the driving force in Wednesday's auction, planning to resell the securities in secondary markets for a profit. Analysts said the public probably needed time to learn about the new security and decide how it would fit into individual investors' portfolios. Retirees concerned about preserving their capital as well as people saving for childrens' education are seen as strong potential buyers because the inflation-indexed feature puts them less at risk if prices begin to escalate. "On the surface, it looks good," said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at broker Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "But since it is a new instrument, you can't compare it to anything. "No doubt it went better than anyone envisioned," Flanagan added. The Treasury Department plans to sell inflation-indexed notes four times a year, with the next sale occurring in April. It will add other maturities besides the 10-year note but no decision has been made yet on whether they will be for a longer or shorter maturity. Treaury Secretary Robert Rubin, a Wall Street veteran, considered the initial inflation-indexed note auction went at "a fair price to the buyer, a fair price to the seller," according to Anderson.
MCAT	Wall Street shares were mildly soft but steady at midday on Thursday, regrouping from volatile swings as money managers adjusted portfolios before the quarter end and next week's Federal Reserve meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about five points at 7685, after shifting between positive and negative territory for most of the day. Still, analysts said it was relatively calm compared to its recent choppiness. The Nasdaq composite was down about two points at 1444, as technology stocks stayed soft after profit warnings.   The long bond, which analysts said was partly guiding the stock market's movement, was moving toward session lows. It was down 9/32 at a 6.76 percent yield. "It's the end of the quarter, so there's a lot of adjusting portfolios, a lot of jiggling here," Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd said. "While we've had some movement today, compared to the recent volatility, it's no great shakes." Jim Benning, a trader at BT Brokerage, said: "The market's kind of flip-flopping around. Over the past couple of days, it's been very volatile. I think it's consolidating here."   The Dow industrials were moving in tandem with bonds, rising when U.S. Treasuries eased from lows and sliding as they dipped, analysts said. "This often happens when the stock market is running ahead of an earnings period," Doug Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan, said. Because many stocks were trading at such high valuations, based on prospects for long-term earnings, the stock market was particularly sensitive to the bond market, interest rates and inflation, Barbara Marcin, a vice president at Citibank Global Asset Management, said.   It was also jittery ahead of next week's Federal Reseve meeting, even though many analysts said they did not believe the Federal Reserve would act to raise interest rates. Other traders said the market was still nervous about comments by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at the start of the week, which caused fears Japan might sell its holdings of U.S. government bonds. But other market concerns faded to the background. Oil prices, whose rise had sparked inflation concerns Wednesday, backed off following a meeting by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).   OPEC pledged to freeze quotas, but oil traders said the deal would do little to stem downward pressure on oil prices. The August crude oil futures contract was down 40 cents at $19.12 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The Nasdaq composite suffered from several earnings warnings from the technology sector. Shares of Komag Inc, which makes thin-film media to store data on computer hard disk drives, were down 7-3/16 at 16-3/8. The company warned its results for the second quarter and the rest of its fiscal year would fall short of expectations because of weak demand for disk drives.   Shares of other disk drive makers were also down. Seagate Technology Inc, the world's largest disk drive maker, led the list of the most active stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, dropping 1-1/16 at 32-15/16. Komag said orders from Seagate would be cut in half to about 15 percent of sales compared with the first quarter.

GCAT	Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk authorised the country's acting head of state to formally appoint Foreign Minister Ung Huot as first prime minister to replace the king's son, the ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh. The king said in a brief message to acting head of state Chea Sim that he should sign the decree appointing Ung Huot if Chea Sim thought it appropriate. "If, in your understanding it should be, you can sign that decree of appointment," the king told Chea Sim in his message from Beijing where he is receiving medical treatment. A copy of the message was released by the palace in Phnom Penh. The constitution requires that a new first prime minister be approved by the king. "He's passing the buck to Chea Sim," said a diplomat. "We know he doesn't approve of what has happened." Ranariddh was ousted by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on July 6 after two days of battles between troops loyal to the rival prime ministers in Phnom Penh. Soon after Sihanouk said he would not sign any decrees on behalf of the new government but authorised Chea Sim to do so. He later said he would not recognise Ung Huot as first premier as the post belonged to his son. The king also said that a vote on a new first prime minister by an incomplete parliament would be invalid. But Ung Huot said on Thursday that he, Hun Sen and Chea Sim would travel to Beijing on Monday for a meeting with Sihanouk the following day. "He will be blessing us," Ung Huot said. Ung Huot also dismissed U.S. concern that his appointment was not democratic and said he expected Chea Sim to formally appoint him as first prime minister later in the day. He said more than 80 percent of FUNCINPEC members of parliament attended the Wednesday National Assembly session which approved his nomination. "If anyone says this is not democratic I say think again," Ung Huot told a news conference. More than two-thirds of the National Assembly members voted by secret ballot to accept Ung Huot's nomination as first prime minister. The assembly also voted by a show of hands to strip Ranariddh of his parliamentary immunity, clearing the way for his prosecution for alleged crimes if he returned to Cambodia. But a U.S. Embassy official said on Thursday that Ung Huot's approval by the assembly and the stripping of Ranariddh's immunity were not democratic given the atmosphere of intimidation in Cambodia. "While we respect Ung Huot as an individual, in the absence of a return by FUNCINPEC members of parliament in exile, and in the current atmosphere of intimidation we do not believe yesterday's votes were democratic," an embassy spokesperson told Reuters. "We hope that FUNCINPEC will revisit this issue when a genuinely free and open environment returns to Phnom Penh," the spokesperson said. But Ung Huot rejected the U.S. worry: "They have to get their information correct for Cambodia," he said. Many supporters of Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party fled the country in the wake of Hun Sen's bloody July 6 takeover and a subsequent crackdown on the party in which some 40 people were killed, according to United Nations human rights officials. Among those who fled were some 20 members of parliament from FUNCINPEC and a small allied party. Ninety-nine of the assembly's 120 members were present for Wednesday's votes. "The king already gave the authority to Chea Sim to sign my appointment," Ung Huot said.
CCAT	Hong Kong utilities stocks rose on Monday on defensive buying, with investors switching to the sector from property counters due to uncertainty over the local property market, brokers said. Brokers said investors were worried about possible measures that may be imposed by the future Hong Kong government to curb speculation in property market. "The property sector is expected to underperform the market in the short run due to uncertainty over the property market," said Sean Li, associate director at Amsteel Securities. "Investors switching out from property to utilities fueled demand for the utilities stocks," Li said. The Hang Seng utilities sub-index was up 2.23 percent at midday, against a 0.66 percent gain for the properties sub-index and a 1.20 percent rise for the overall Hang Seng index. Brokers said demand for shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd led the rise of the utilities. Hongkong Telecom shares rose HK$0.35 to HK$16.70 at midday. "It is a kind of defensive and rotational buying which boosted demand for utilities, following the recent strength on banks and conglomerates, and the mixed view on property," said Michael Ng, dealing director at Sassoon Securities. Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd rose HK$1.15 to HK$30.60, Hongkong Ferry (Holdings) Co Ltd rose HK$1.05 to HK$15.90, China Light & Power Co Ltd rose HK$0.50 to HK$42.80, and Hong Kong & China Gas Co Ltd rose HK$0.40 to HK$14.75. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6370.  http://www.hk97.com

ECAT	Australian Finance Minister John Fahey said on a Wednesday that the Federal budget would increase national savings and put downward pressure on interest rates. Asked by reporters if there was room for further interest rate cuts, Fahey said: "That's a matter for the Reserve Bank, but what the budget does do, it increases national savings and that puts downward pressure on interest rates. It certianly gives a base for that to occur."   The government announced on Tuesday it would make A$3.9 billon of budget cuts to produce an underlying budget deficit in the year to June 30, 1997 of A$5.65 billion. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
CCAT	Volvo Car sales in Japan and Germany rose by 22.1 percent and 33 percent respectively in October, a company spokesman said on Tuesday. The car division of the Swedish vehicle manufacturer sold 1,534 cars in Japan last month, spokesman Ingmar Hesslefors told Reuters. He said this brought total sales for the period January to the end of October to 20,241 cars in Japan, a rise of 21.8 percent on the same period a year earlier. In calendar 1995 Volvo sold 20,550 cars in Japan. "Our forecast for sales of around 23,000 cars in Japan for full year 1996 remains unchanged," Hesslefors said. In Germany sales rose 33 percent to 3,201 in October, according to preliminary figures. For January to October Volvo sold 26,640 cars in Germany which was a slight fall from a year ago when 27,665 cars were sold. "In October we sold 1,500 of the new S40/V40 model in Germany and this shows that it is stating to make its mark in that country. It's a break in the trend," Hesslesfors told Reuters. Although Volvo Cars' sales for the year to date were 0.4 percent down on last year, the company expected to match 1995 full year sales. "Last year we sold 31,000 cars in Germany in the full year and we expect to reach around that level this year too," he said. -- Henrik Alberius, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1250

GCAT	Rashaan Salaam rushed for a second-quarter touchdown, Jeff Jaeger kicked two field goals and the Chicago Bears' special teams made several big plays in a 15-13 victory over the Minnesota Vikings on Monday. The Bears (3-5) trailed 3-2 after the first quarter, but scored 13 consecutive points in the second period. Salaam's one-yard scoring run, which capped a seven-play, 58-yard drive, was sandwiched between field goals of 41 and 44 yards by Jaeger that made it 15-3 at the half. Jaeger's second field goal was set up by Mark Carrier interception of a Warren Moon pass. The Bears picked up their first two points on a safety when Kevin Minniefield blocked a punt and punter Mitch Berger knocked the ball went out of the end zone. Chicago's special teams came up big again in the fourth quarter when Sean Harris blocked a field goal attempt that would have put the Vikings ahead by one. Minnesota scored the only points of the second half in the third quarter as Moon found Qadry Ismail on a 54-yard touchdown strike to make it 15-10. The Vikings added a 43-yard Scott Sisson field goal to close the gap to 15-13. Dave Krieg completed 23-of-35 passes for 187 yards with two interceptions for Chicago. Moon was 15-of-26 for 218 yards with a touchdown and interception before suffering a mild right ankle sprain in the third quarter. Chicago linebacker Brian Cox made a huge play in the closing minutes when he stripped backup quarterback Brad Johnson at the 31 and recovered the fumble himself to seal the win for the Bears. The Vikings fell to 5-3, dropping two games back of first-place Green Bay in the NFC Central Division by losing for the third time in four games.
ECAT	Underlying UK inflation edged upwards in September, creating another headache for Britain's ruling Conservative Party and its hopes for substantial, vote-winning tax cuts, analysts said. "This figure will be a double blow to Clarke," said Alex Garrard, UK economist at UBS. "Not only does it take the gloss off his speech, but the September inflation figures are used to uprate social security benefits." The rise in underlying inflation to 2.9 percent year-on-year will therefore add to the government's spending bill.   Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke will deliver a keynote speech to the Conservative Party's annual conference in Bournemouth later on Thursday. With elections due by May 1997 and the Conservatives trailing badly in the polls, many in the party are baying for substantial tax cuts from Clarke in his November budget. Garrard said the pick-up in September inflation, and the consequent rise in social security and pensions payments, could add as much as 500 million stg to government spending. "It's a further headache for Clarke's budget sums and cramps his scope for tax cuts," he said.   But September's inflation figures may not herald a long-term rise in price pressures yet. The headline figure held steady at 2.1 percent year-on-year and much of the upward pressure came from rising petrol and clothing and footwear prices. Rising petrol prices, reflected in a 1.5 percent monthly increase in motoring costs, have been fuelled by higher crude oil prices and petrol retailers rebuilding margins. But Garrard said price competition would resume soon. "Near-term, that upward pressure will continue but once the oil price drops back a bit the price war at the petrol pumps will resume."   The largest price increases came from clothing and footwear. They leapt by 5.2 percent in September, the highest monthly rise on record, according to the Office For National Statistics. "We know that retailing is doing quite well and they've obviously used the opportunity to push through higher prices on the autumn lines at the end of the summer sales," said Marian Bell, economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. But Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets, said it was too early to say high street spending sprees will fuel retail price inflation.   "Consumers are still looking for value for money in the high street and the steep drop in factory gate inflation should soon start to feed through into core retail price inflation." Producer output prices rose just 2.0 percent year-on-year in August, their lowest since mid-1994. Garrard agreed. "From an initial reaction of 'Oh dear', I'm inclined to treat this figure as more of a blip." But whether inflation is on an upward path or not, Thursday's figures certainly do not weaken the Bank of England's hand as it calls for an early tightening of monetary policy, taking base rates to 6.00 percent from 5.75.   But few analysts expect Clarke to budge ahead of the elections, particularly if he can produce only modest tax cuts in November. "The figures are not bad enough to worry the Chancellor but will reinforce the Bank's campaign for policy tightening," said Andrew Milligan, economist at General Accident. A still-struggling manufacturing economy and a resilient currency give Clarke enough ammunition to keep the Bank at bay. "It will reawaken speculation about a pre-emptive rate rise, but Clarke can highlight still-weak manufacturing and the strength of the pound to leave rates on hold," Garrard said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109

GCAT	Chad Carvin, a virtual lock for the 1996 Olympic Games before suffering a career-threatening illness, showed he is back in winning form Tuesday at the U.S. national swimming championships. Carvin, 23, ranked second in the world in the 200- and 400-meter freestyle events before the Olympic trials, came from behind to win the 400 freestyle in three minutes, 50.13 seconds. It was Carvin's third national title against a field that included Olympic 400-meter individual medley gold medalist Tom Dolan. "I always knew I would be back, I just wasn't sure when," Carvin said. "I am swimming good times so I don't think there's any question about my illness anymore." Carvin was stricken with cardiomyopathy, a virus that attacks the heart muscle, in December 1995, just three months before the Olympic trials. He was confined to bed rest for 90 days. "At the beginning it was a career-ending disease," said 1996 Olympic men's coach Jon Urbanchek, who gave Carvin his award. "He walked back literally from the grave. Everyone in this pool is proud of him. Chad is back." Dolan, experiencing breathing problems since he arrived because of heat and pool chemicals, experienced stomach problems before the race, and had a slight asthma attack as a result during the race. He finished eighth in 4:01.76. The only other individual men's winner was Lenny Krayzelburg, 21, in the 100-meter backstroke in 55.05. Misty Hyman, 18, posted the fastest 100-meter butterfly time (58.72) by an American in 64 months in the morning preliminary with her innovative fish kick and underwater start. She won the event in 59.49. Hyman is only the eighth swimmer to break 59 and four of the swimmers are from China. Schoolgirl Jenna Street, 15, won the 200-meter breaststroke in 2 minutes, 28.97 seconds to win her first national title in only her second senior nationals. Street swam against a field that included Olympians Kristine Quance, Jilen Siroky and Amanda Beard, a double silver medalist at the 1996 Olympics in breaststroke. "I told myself she's a girl just like I am, the same age," Street said about swimming against Beard, "just treat her the same way I would anyone else."
GCAT	Organisers of the Sydney 2000 Olympics expect a budget surplus of up to A$50 million (US$39 million) and have set up a A$150 million "rainy day" fund, organising committee president Michael Knight said on Thursday. Knight told a news conference he expected the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) budget surplus to be larger than the A$20 million estimated in 1993 when Sydney won the right to host the Games. "So a surplus of somewhere in the A$20 million to A$50 million range will come from the Sydney Games," Knight said. SOCOG's budget has grown to A$2.4 billion from the A$1.7 billion in its bid to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). SOCOG has said television rights would raise A$1.6 billion, major sponsors A$500 million, and the rest would be met through merchandising and ticket sales. Knight said SOCOG would make a direct payment of A$200 million to the New South Wales (NSW) state government to help defray the cost of building Olympic facilities. Local media and politicians have questioned the finances of the Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA), the NSW government body charged with building Olympic infrastructure. The government said in its 1996/97 budget that the cost of building Games infrastructure had risen to A$1.91 billion from an original budget of A$1.54 billion. The OCA budget does not include the building of the Olympic village or stadium, expected to be met by private investment. Underwriters of a public share float to build the main Olympic stadium said last week their float had been massively undersubscribed, leaving them with a A$214.3 million shortfall. Knight, the NSW Olympic Minister who also heads the OCA and is president of SOCOG, said a SOCOG "contingency fund" had also been established for unexpected expenses. "There will be a large figure of at least A$150 million of contingency or rainy day fund to cover any unexpected expenditures and of course, if not used up, then 90 percent of that will be refunded to the taxpayers as profit," Knight said. Full details of both SOCOG and OCA budgets will be made public in May when the government hands down its 1997/98 budget. Opposition politicians in the NSW state parliament on Thursday introduced proposed legislation aimed at forcing the government to make regular reports on the cost of the Games, including expenditure reviews and estimates of future costs. "There is growing concern that the true cost of the Olympics is being hidden by the...government and will only be revealed after the Games have concluded," said opposition leader Peter Collins. A major factor in Sydney winning the Olympic bid was that the state government would underwrite the cost of the Games. The controversial Atlanta Olympics last year were not government-backed and Games organisers forced to cover a US$1.7 billion budget struggled to break even. (A$1 = 0.78)
MCAT	LONDON, July 4 (Reuter) The dollar retreated, slipping to its lowest levels in a week against the yen, after Thursday's June U.S. jobs report dampened expectations of a rise in U.S. interest rates in the near future. The report showed the U.S. jobless rate rose to 5 percent in June from a near 24-year low of 4.8 percent in May, and that the pace of job creation in the private sector slowed. "The dollar is slipping primarily in the wake of the payrolls data," said Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB. Dollar/yen, which earlier fell as low as 113.24, was at 113.24/29 at 0730 GMT from 113.42/52 late on Thursday in Europe.

Total settlements reached a modest 20.8 million kuna, roughly half of which were old loans and the rest were call money borrowings, made at a rate of nine percent. No fresh longer-term loans were made and the end of trading left a surplus of 30 million kuna on the supply side. Overnight trade at the weekend reached 29.5 million kuna, which four banks with shortfalls used to square their position. The central bank calculated its kuna midrates for Tuesday slightly weaker at 5.4029 against the dollar and 3.5696 against the German mark. -- Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075

CCAT	Mitsubishi Motors Corp (MMC) is negotiating with Hyundai Motor Co Ltd on supplying low-emission gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines for passenger cars, an MMC spokesman said on Tuesday. "We are in negotiations and no decision has yet been made," the spokesman said. He offered no further details of the talks. The Japanese business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun said on Tuesday that MMC would supply 10,000 to 20,000 of its 4,500 cc GDI engines annually to Hyundai, which would use them in its high-end passenger cars. The paper said that the Japanese car maker would also provide Hyundai with diesel engine technology for trucks. The MMC spokesman said that the company already concluded an agreement in 1996 with Hyundai over the transfer of diesel technology.
ECAT	Pakistan may be unable to meet an IMF-set target of cutting its budget deficit to four percent of gross domestic product by June, Sartaj Aziz, widely expected to become the next finance minister, said on Tuesday. "The four percent target may take another year or so, rather than June this year, but I think on the whole the IMF package would not be difficult to implement if business confidence is restored and we are able to accelerate the industrial growth and increase exports," he told Reuters Financial Television.   Aziz, who was finance minister in the last Pakistan Muslim League (PML) government led by Nawaz Sharif, said he would accept whatever role Sharif assigned to him in the next cabinet. He was speaking as results from Monday's national and provincial elections showed the PML sweeping to a landslide victory against ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Aziz said the new government's priority would be to restore business confidence, revive the industrial sector and increase exports to stabilise the balance of payments. It would also seek to accelerate privatisation and economic reform. The International Monetary Fund agreed to resume and expand a stalled standby loan to Pakistan in December after the caretaker government promised to cut the deficit to four percent of GDP by the end of fiscal 1996/97 (July-June).
GCAT	Israel on Wednesday released a Jewish settler who had been detained without trial ahead of the Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank town of Hebron. Noam Federman, who lives in a fortified enclave in Hebron's heart with about 400 other Jewish settlers amid the town's 100,000 Palestinians, vowed on his release to continue to fight against Israel handing over land to Palestinians. "Detention did not break me," Federman, a leader of the outlawed anti-Arab Kach movement, told Israel's Itim news agency. "I am returning to Hebron...Detention did not change my opinion and I will continue to fight for the Land of Israel." Itim said Federman, who before his detention had vowed to bring thousands of Jews to Hebron to roam sections of the town set to come under Palestinian rule and thus thwart the redeployment, had been in detention for 2-1/2 months. Israel handed 80 percent of Hebron to Palestinian rule last week. It still controls the centre of town where the Jewish enclaves are located. Israel captured Hebron along with the rest of the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. The town, sacred to Moslems and Jews as the burial place of their forefather Abraham, has long been a flashpoint of violence between the sides. In one of the worst incidents, settler Baruch Goldstein in February 1994 massacred 29 Arabs at prayer in the town. Goldstein, who an Israeli investigation ruled acted alone, had been a member of Kach.

MCAT	The Australian All Resources share index (Wednesday close 1,361.7) has continued to trade lower, but has bounced from a double-bottom. Traders expect more of the same within established bands which are currently 1,365 to 1,415. Short term technical indicators continue to be bearish. With the index less than 10 points from last week the moving averages are bunched around the index level. Traders are likely to wait for a clearer signal before moving either way. Leading indicators are all moving lower, but could become oversold soon. All Fibonacci levels have been reached on the move lower. With the double bottom bounce, traders have focused on the higher final target at 1,389. In the medium term the index is back within the band 1,365 to 1,415. Traders are likely to continue to trade the ranges and the break. The overall larger bull market also has support at 1,300. Medium term technicals are mixed. Recent consolidation has bunched the averages around the index. The ROC is moving lower, the RSI is sidelined, and the Stochastic while trending higher is lower than last week. These indicators are not inspiring to either bulls or bears. In the longer term, the index still looks bullish, but must move higher and remain above 1,400 to keep the bulls happy. Longer term technicals are mixed to bearish. Traders are most likely to trade the breaks. The index continues to range-trade. Technicals are on balance bearish. Traders will continue using the established ranges and major levels to adjust and set new positons. Support is at 1,330, 1,350 and 1,365, with resiatance at 1,415 and 1,455.

ECAT	The New York State Comptroller on Thursday praised New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for using an unexpected $450 million surge in tax revenues to reduce some of the risks in the city's 1997 fiscal budget. The comptroller, who reviews New York City's budgets and who had blasted the latest $33 billion program for not closing long-term gaps, said he would soon report on the new plan. Saying he was happy the mayor had addressed some of the concerns he had raised, H. Carl McCall said in a statement: "He (Giuliani) is using a portion of the tax windfall to remove the most obvious risks in the fiscal 1997 budget and is proposing some savings as a down-payment to address the still-sizable out-year gaps." The Giuliani Administration projected tax revenues would rise more than it first thought because the financial industry is expected to have big profits. But noting how volatile the industry can be, it is projecting only a $120 million tax surplus in 1998, and a $50 million windfall in 1999.   While the city as expected slashed agency cutbacks in fiscal 1997 to $179 million from this summer's estimate of $500 million, budget director Joseph Lhota told reporters at a news conference that agencies are expected to cut $400 million in 1998, when the budget gap will total $1.23 billion. Parks will see their funding drop by about $7.6 million, Cultural Affairs $12 million, Social Services $38.4 million, Corrections $61 million, and the Health and Hospitals Corp nearly $83 million. The police will lose around $2.3 million and the fire department $2.7 million. One of the city's proposals is expected to win praise from its monitors: it no longer plans to pay for raises won by unionised workers at the Health and Hospitals Corp, the Housing Authority, and the City University of New York. Instead, these so-called covered organisations will have to find the money to pay for the hikes over the next four years. For fiscal 1997, the city raised spending by $202 million. --212-859-1654

The key January 1997 contract did not trade, with both long and short position holders having liquidated all their positions on Wednesday. The March contract rose two yuan to 3,142 yuan per tonne, May rose eight yuan to 3,188, July rose one to 3,251, November climbed three to 3,368, and September fell 10 to 3,278.   Combined volume fell to 9,200 tonnes from 33,200 on Wednesday. Traders said the market trend changed little despite today's gains. "Retail investors dominated today's trading, but that didn't change the mood of uncertainty over the short-term market trend," one trader said. "Most investors are liquidating their positions gradually with the approach of the Chinese new year holiday." Analysts expected soybeans to continue moving in a narrow range in the short term.

ECAT	Russian gross domestic product calculations for January and February reflect increased weighting given to the unofficial underground economy, a State Statistics Committee official said on Friday. Vladimir Sokolin, Deputy Chairman of the committee, told a news conference an overall review of economic indicators going back as far as 1990 was possible. He said that by the end of last year the shadow economy, which includes street vendors and entrepreneurs with unregistered businesses among others, accounted for around 23 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The shadow economy had accounted for about 20 percent of earlier calculations. "It's very possible that it will increase to 25 percent," Sokolin said. He said 1996 committee figures did not reflect what he said was a reversal in the downward trend of the Russian economy which started in the second half of last year. "There will definitely be a review of both 1996 and 1997 figures," Solokin said, adding that work on the review would begin in April. He said a more in-depth revision of methodology to be completed by the end of 1997 could lead to a further overhaul of economic statistics going back to 1990. But Sokolin denied accusations the committee had changed its methodology. He said the dynamics of the economy had changed. "If you're observing a family that last year had one child and this year has another child you can't really say that statistics changed the family," said Sokolin. --Christina Ling, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
GCAT	Afghanistan's Taleban government said on Thursday its former foreign minister Mullah Mohammad Ghous had escaped from captivity by northern opposition forces. Taleban-controlled Kabul radio said Ghous and an unspecified number of colleagues had arrived in the Taleban-held northern province of Kunduz with "the cooperation of the people of (neighbouring) Balkh province". "With great joy we received the report that Mullah Mohammad Ghous...arrived in Kunduz province today safe and sound," said the broadcast monitored in the Pakistani capital Islamabad. Opposition sources had said Ghous was detained with several other Taleban officials when the forces commanded by northern opposition leader General Abdul Malik drove Taleban forces out of Balkh province capital Mazar-i-Sharif only a few days after they had captured the town with his support. But the Kabul radio broadcast on Thursday said Ghous and his colleagues were taken to a safe place by people of Mazar-i-Sharif. "And today, with the direct help and cooperation of the people of Mazar-i-Sharif, he arrived in Kunduz and joined the Taleban there," it said. It said Ghous met Taleban's Information and Culture Minister Mullah Amir Khan Mutaqi after arrival in Kunduz. The Taleban had set the release of its officials and hundreds of its captured fighters as a precondition for peace talks with opposition forces. Other Taleban officials earlier reported detained by opposition forces included then central bank governor Mullah Ahsanullah and Herat province governor Mullah Abdul Razzaq. It was not immediately known whether Ahsanullah, who has also been replaced as bank chief, and Razzaq were among those who arrived with Ghous in Kunduz. A Pakistan-based Afghan news service, Afghan Islamic Press, said Ghous had escaped with six companions. General Malik had turned on Taleban in Mazar-i-Sharif only eight days after striking an alliance with the purist Islamic militia amid a mutiny he staged against then opposition leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum, who later fled to Turkey.
MCAT	Global commodities prices will hold broadly steady in 1997 and rise by four percent in 1998, German economic research institute IFO said. IFO was releasing results agreed by a group of nine European research institutes (AIECE) which monitor price trends. The forecast for 26 non-energy commodities assumed economic growth of 2.6 percent in 1997 and 2.7 percent in 1998 in the industrialised world and the dollar at around 1.70 marks. Energy prices were forecast to drop by one percent 1997 and by five percent in 1998 after a 15 percent rise in 1996. The overall effect of the price changes on global economic growth should be neutral as falls in energy prices would be offset by price increases in other sectors, the report said. Cereals producers had expanded production after high prices in 1996 and this should reduce prices in 1997 and 1998. AIECE forecast wheat prices off 23 percent (1997) and seven percent (1998), barley off 17 and seven, and maize off 19 and five. Coffee prices, which shed 26 percent in 1996, were forecast to rise by 31 percent in 1997 and to be steady in 1998. Sugar, which was down five percent in 1996, was seen down six percent in 1997 and off two in 1998. Cocoa was projected five percent and one percent higher over the two year, after gains of two percent in 1996. Forecasts for base metals were as follows -- aluminium up 10 percent in each year (down 16 in 1996), nickel up three and 13 (off nine), copper up seven both years (off 22), lead off eight and up eight (up 23), tin off three then up four (off one), zinc up 22 and up six (off one). Rubber prices were forecast to fall by six percent in 1997, followed by a seven percent rise in 1998 (off five percent 1996). Cotton prices were seen broadly steady over the two-year period after a 16 percent decline in 1996. --Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275

GCAT	Australian flyhalf David Knox promises a victory lap few will forget if the Wallabies break their Dunedin jinx in Saturday's Tri-Nations test against New Zealand. "If I make it 10 out of 10 I'll make a nude lap around the field," he told reporters. Knox, who has never played in a losing Wallaby team since he began his test career in 1985, admits extending his nine-test run will not be an easy one. New Zealand's All Blacks are strong favourites going into the game, having had a seven-test winning streak so far this year, and have a powerful spell of their own at the Carisbrook ground -- the Wallabies have never scored a win there. "My unbeaten test record's going to be sorely tested. I've been regarded as a good luck charm for the team -- it worked out for us last week -- but you can't take anything for granted at this level," Knox said. All Black coach John Hart acknowledged Knox as vital to the Australian effort and said he had been discussed by the team. "If you don't close him down you're in a big trouble because he is a very, very good player. We'll certainly be looking at putting pressure on him," Hart said. Knox is also hoping for some latitude from French referee Joel Dume, saying: "They (the All Blacks) always fringe on the offside and that makes it very tough for you to play." The All Blacks have a strong hand going into the game, helped by the confirmation during Friday that Knox's counterpart, Carlos Spencer, is fit to play after a minor injury in training on Thursday. New Zealand are poised to win their second Tri-Nations crown if they clean up on Saturday, but coach John Hart has assured that his team will not be complacent going on to the field. "We need to win the game to win the Tri-Nations, so I don't think we lack for motivation -- but nor do the Australians." With the Wallabies hit hard by injuries, including the loss of captain John Eales, the odds are lengthening on them to win. New Zealand's TAB betting organisation has the All Blacks at near even odds for a win, while an Australian victory would pay a sevenfold return. With wintry weather forecast, and Carisbrook's terraces set to be packed with "scarfies" (Otago University students), Knox's proposed lap of honour could be more challenging than he thinks.

GCAT	Atletico Madrid signed Brazilian midfielder Juninho for $20.2 million from English first division club Middlesbrough on Tuesday. The move ended weeks of speculation about Juninho's future after Middlesbrough were relegated from the premier league at the end of last season. "I am very disappointed that we have not been able to keep Juninho because he had a very special relationship with us," Keith Lamb, Middlesbrough's chief executive told BBC Radio Five. But Middlesbrough cannot be too sad. Having bought Juninho for $7.6 million in 1995, they have made a handsome profit, although his inspiration and brilliant ball-skills will be badly missed. An 11 million pound ($18.5 million) deal had been agreed with premier league club Tottenham but Juninho, 24, was known to prefer a move to Spain where greater exposure on Brazilian television would increase his chances of selection for the 1998 World Cup finals. "Atletico first showed an interest in signing me about two or three months ago," the Brazilian said on Tuesday. "They are an ambitious club and one of the biggest clubs in Spain and the Spanish league is shown in Brazil every weekend." Under the terms of the deal, Juninho will remain with the Spanish club for five years. The deal also contracts Atletico to play two games against Middlesbrough at their Riverside stadium over the next two seasons. "Finally we've achieved what I and everyone at Atletico wanted," Atletico's managing director Miguel Angel Gil told Spanish state television. Small in stature but big in heart, Juninho helped Middlesbrough to two cup finals last season. But both ended in defeat and an extraordinary season was capped when the club was relegated, to the distress of the thousands of fans -- and Juninho himself. Voted, Brazilian Player of the Year in 1994, Juninho scored on his international debut in February 1995 in Brazil's 5-0 win over Slovakia, although he is currently out of the squad. In November 1995, he signed for Middlesbrough for a then club-record fee of 4.5 million pounds ($7.6 million). Last season he played in 34 of Middlesbrough's 38 league matches, scoring 12 times and adding another three cup goals. ($ = 0.594 British Pounds)

CCAT	Sri Lanka's Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday it had found the directors of Kelani Tyres Ltd guilty of malfeasance for failing to disclose a big fall in its audited 1994 profit. "The (SEC) determined that the directors of Kelani Tyres have been guilty of malfeasance by their failure to comply with their Continuing Disclosure Obligations as required by the rules of the (SEC) and the Colombo Stock Exchange," it said in a statement. "The Commission also strictly warned the directors against any repetition of such conduct," it added. The directors conceded, at an inquiry held by the SEC, that although unaudited accounts for the year ended March 31, 1994, released to the public on June 26, 1994, indicated a profit of 19.3 million rupees, a later audit revealed the profit at 1.6 million rupees, the statement said. The directors also admitted that although the audit had been finalised by August 30, 1994, and was approved by the board on September 1, 1994, they had failed to inform the public of the changes until October 31, 1994, it said. An SEC official said there was no penal sanction or fine attached to the finding of malsfeasance

ECAT	The French government is considering easing a special tax on the wealthy so that rich people do not flee the country, Urban Affairs and Integration Minister Eric Raoult said on Sunday. "We would not want the hen that lays a golden egg to leave...allowing capital to escape, little by little, out of the country," Raoult said in an interview on French Radio J. He acknowledged that the so-called "solidarity tax on great wealth" was popular with the public but said he believed the right balance could be found to keep the public satisfied while encouraging the wealthy to remain on French soil. Parliament is in the midst of weighing the 1997 state budget but has so far left the wealth tax unchanged. Conservative President Jacques Chirac said earlier this year that the tax should be eased, but the opposition Socialists promptly attacked the idea as evidence of Chirac's "solidarity with the rich". The tax will this year bring in an estimated 8.8 billion francs ($1.7 billion) from some 170,000 taxpayers. The miniumum rate is 0.5 percent of total assets of 4.6 million francs, rising to a maximum of 1.5 percent for holdings above 45.5 million francs. ($1=5.088 French Franc)
MCAT	The Canadian Wheat Board said Thursday it had raised by C$15.00 to C$16.00 per tonne its 1997/98 Pool Return Outlook (PRO) for wheat and also hiked PROs for durum, feed barley and designated barley. CWB said in its April report that a severe frost in U.S. hard red winter wheat growing areas, flooding in the Red River Valley, and dry conditions in Australia and the European Union had contributed to the raising of the wheat projection. The durum PRO was increased by C$16.00 per tonne, boosted by poor crop conditions in North Africa, an expected cut in U.S. acreage and dry weather in Spain and Italy Feed barley PROs were raised by C$12.00 per tonne with production seen hurt by dry conditions in the European Union, the world's largest exporter of feed barley. Designated barley PROs were up C$7.00 per tonne on dry weather in the European Union and expectations that flooding in the Red River Valley in a significant portion of the North American six-row growing area. PROs are monthly CWB estimates of crop year returns, which take into account factors such as market fundamentals, weather and exchange rates.

GCAT	Weeping crowds mourning the death of Deng Xiaoping swamped the hamlet where China's political patriarch was born, prompting authorities to send armed police to keep order, officials said on Friday. Thousands of mourners flocked to Paifang village in Guang'an county in the southwestern province of Sichuan, some falling to their knees and weeping, said an official at Deng's former residence, now a museum. "There are a lot of people crying, some of them young, but most of them are older," the official said by telephone. "Some old people have knelt on the ground and wept. Their faces were covered in tears," he said. Deng, architect of market-oriented reforms that transformed China into a rising superpower, passed away on Wednesday night aged 92. Officials at Deng's old courtyard abode, which normally saw some 100 visitors a day, were unable to handle the flood of people that broke over the hamlet after Deng's death was announced early on Thursday. "About 3,000 people came here yesterday," the official said. "Today there will be more." "It's extremely crowded in here," he said. "Anywhere there is room to stand is crowded with people." Officials sent the paramilitary People's Armed Police to maintain order at the museum, which had been converted into a makeshift shrine to Deng, he said. "Although there are a lot of people, everything is orderly," the official said, adding that no incidents had been reported. A large photograph of Deng hung over the courtyard entrance, crowned by a black banner with white characters reading "Mourn Deng Xiaoping With Sorrow", he said. "One young fellow cried and said 'Without Deng there would not be the happy life of today'," the official said. Mourners, many wearing black armbands and holding white, handmade paper flowers, filed past the photograph, bowing or kneeling in front of a table heaped with cypress branches symbolising uprightness and longevity. Some of those paying their last respects to Deng had come from distant Guangzhou and Shenzhen in the southern province of Guangdong, a booming region that owed its prosperity to his ambitious capitalistic reforms, another museum official said. "Taxis, shops, hotels...and those who have come to Guang'an for business or as tourists are displaying white flowers to show their grief over Deng Xiaoping," the China News Service said. The outpouring of sadness and reflection in Paifang contrasted with the bustling streets of Beijing, where flags flying at half-mast on the second day of official mourning were the only sign of a break from routine. The Supreme People's Court, China's top judicial body, ordered all courts to ensure strict law enforcement and to safeguard social stability, the official Xinhua news agency said. Political transitions in communist China in the past have been fraught with difficulty and the deaths of some previous senior leaders have triggered mass protests.
MCAT	Fuel oil tumbled on Friday with easier crude, the ending of the strike at Elf's three French refineries and the prospect of American fuel flooding the European market. Up to $4 was shaved off high sulphur cargo prices and low sulphur was off about $2. Traders said the sharp drop in high sulphur cracked prices reflected a lack of fundamental strength. "It was closely tied in with crude and also a bit by the Elf strike and they have both gone," said one trader. A cargo was heard sold into a utility at $119 cif NWE, $4 off a similar deal done on Thursday. Two coking units in the U.S are also off-line, one of which will be out for three weeks maintenance. Up to 165,000 tonnes of fuel will have to find an alternative home and a large parcel over 50,000 tonnes is expected to head into ARA. Dealers said the arbitrage is open from the U.S. into Europe and some are bracing themselves for the extra product.

MCAT	U.S. mortgage-backed securities prices were trading near session highs at late afternoon Thursday, taking their cue from a small rally in Treasury prices. Most fixed-coupon pass-through yield spreads to Treasuries were relatively flat as credit markets had little new economic information to digest. "(Yield spreads) are pretty stable here," said one trader. Given the shape of the Treasury yield curve, he said, mortgage yield spreads "are in pretty decent shape."   Mortgage prices remained firm amid light trading volume. One pass-through trader said there were rumors earlier in the session of a "big seller" of mortgages versus a buyer of 10-year notes. "Although the dollar rolls have all collapsed, and that might be an indication of it, I have not seen any selling and I have seen absolutely no selling from mortgage bankers," the trader said. By 1500 EDT/1900 GMT, fixed-coupon mortgage prices were up 5/32 to 11/32 overall, while comparable Treasury prices were 6/32 to 10/32 higher.   Specifically, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5-percent paper was up 8/32 at 99-11/32, yielding 89 basis points over the five-year Treasury note. Comparable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issues were up 8/32 as well, at 99-15/32 and 99-19/32, respectively. Five-year Treasuries were up 6/32 at 6.59 percent, and 10-year notes were up 10/32 at 6.72 percent. (( -- Jeff Coelho, 212-859-1660 ))

ECAT	A Canadian manufacturing firm hoping to locate a plant in Vermont was reconsidering the move because of uncertainty over property tax reform. Vermont and the tiny town of Milton have been negotiating a complicated agreement over taxes and other issues with Ontario, Canada-based Husky Injection Molding Systems Ltd which makes plastic goods. If the deal goes through, Milton and the rest of Chittenden County will gain as many as 2500 high-paying jobs.   But the Vermont Supreme Court's recent landmark decision overturning the state education funding system threatens to squelch the deal. The Vermont Legislature, in order to find a more equitable method to pay for education, is considering imposing a statewide property tax. Such a move would supersede Milton's offer to lower its property-tax rate for Husky's benefit. Husky has set a June 1 deadline for making a decision on whether to go ahead with the deal, according to the privately-held company's spokesman Dick Schlimm.   "It's no secret that we're interested in the tax debate," Schlimm said. He recently wrote Vermont Governor Howard Dean a personal letter outlining the company's concerns. Dean said yesterday that he had not read the letter yet but that he will respond to it shortly. "I'm always concerned if a company the size of Husky is unhappy," the governor said. William Shouldice, the state's Development Director concedes that other companies have been shy about moving to Vermont because of the prospect of higher property taxes. The state Senate is currently wrangling over details of the property tax plan. Even when a plan passes the Senate, it must be reconciled with the already-passed House plan.

CCAT	Grow Biz International Inc said Friday it backs the second-quarter earnings consensus of $0.16 a share. "We're comfortable with those numbers," Ronald Olson, president and chief executive officer of the used merchandise retail chain, said in an interview.   The projected results for the second quarter are more than double the $0.07 a share Grow Biz reported a year ago. Olson said he backed the 1997 earnings estimate range of $0.65 to $0.67 a share, up from $0.40 a year ago. "We're comfortable with that," he added. Revenues for the second quarter, however, will be "a little bit flat," Olson said, due to Grow Biz's elimination of its corporate buying group that helped franchisees finance the purchase of merchandise. The buying group had been a low-margin operation, he added. Grow Biz's retail divisions include Play It Again Sports, selling used sporting goods; Once Upon A Child, children's merchandise; Computer Renaissance, computers; Disc Go Round, compact disks, and Music Go Round, musical instruments.

Bon told a news conference that the price range for the shares would be announced in the evening of May 5 after which retail investors would have three weeks to subscribe to shares. The final price will be announced in the evening of May 26 and trading on Paris and New York exchanges is set for June 9. "The size of this operation will naturally depend on market conditions at the time and on market demand for France Telecom shares. Today, on March 19, the initial indications are very encouraging," Bon told a news conference. "The first survey results reveal tremendous interest from retail investors... This has led the French government to consider giving this operation a much broader dimension than previously planned," he said. "If the stock market's current positive outlook is confirmed, this would be by far the largest privatisation ever carried out in France," he added. In February 1994, the government raised 35.7 billion francs from the sale of shares in oil group Elf-Aquitaine . The France Telecom receipts will provide money for other state-owned firms -- whose capital injections are meant to be funded from privatisation revenues -- and help meet a growing bill to plug holes in such companies as troubled bank Credit Lyonnais and insurer Groupe GAN . France Telecom officials said while the size of the float and split between private and institutional investors depended on the market, an "ideal" model would see 30 percent go to the market, 10 percent to France Telecom staff and a further 10 percent to ally Deutsche Telekom for a 1998 share swap. France Telecom, Deutsche and Sprint Corp of the United States are partners in the Global One alliance. Analysts have so far put a range of between 100 and 200 billion francs on the market value of France Telecom. The company will on Thursday hold a day-long briefing for analysts after which Bon said the range would be "narrowed." France Telecom said it had made a 1996 net consolidated profit of 14.5 billion francs, against 14 billion in 1995. But after non-recurrent special charges, the 1996 net attributable profit was 2.1 billion francs against 9.2 billion in 1995. Operating income climbed to 30.3 billion francs from 29.6 billion. Sales rose to 151.3 billion francs from 147.8 billion in 1995 -- making it the number four world telecoms group in sales terms after AT&T , Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan and Deutsche Telekom but before British Telecom . Full liberalisation of the French and European telecoms market will start on January 1, 1998, and rivals are already preparing to enter the French market. One is the Cegetel unit of Cie Generale des Eaux with British Telecom and Mannesmann AG . Another is a venture of Bouygues with Italy's STET .
ECAT	Pakistan's National Credit Consultative Council (NCCC) said on Wednesday it had raised the credit target 14.18 percent to 137.1 billion rupees for fical 1996/97 (July-June) from 102 billion in the year ago period after a sharp rise in the first half. A statement by the State (central) Bank of Pakistan after the NCCC meeting said domestic credit rose 13 percent to 128 billion rupees in the first half compared to a target of 102 billion rupees for the whole year. "Government borrowing for budgetary support alone accounted for well over 60 percent of total credit expansion up to December 26, 1996." The bank said credit to the private sector expanded by 50 billion rupees, indicating an increase of seven billion rupees compared to an actual credit expansion in the private sector in 1995/96. Money supply increased five percent, or 47.5 billion rupees, by December 26 compared with the overall target of 116 billion rupees for the whole year, the bank said. Lower monetary expansion was the result of a massive depletion of net foreign assets of the banking system, which neutralised to a very large extent the expansionary impact of domestic credit on money supply, the bank said. Money supply had now been projected to increase 13.1 percent, or 123 billion, compared to 116 billion rupees provided in the original credit plan for 1996/97, it said. It said expansion in money supply from the present low level mainly represented a build-up of net foreign assets of the banking system. ($1 = 40.22 rupees) -- Karachi newsroom 9221-5685192
CCAT	Specialty chemicals group Albright & Wilson Plc said on Thursday that raw material cost rises have plateaued, but there is little sign of them falling. Despite continuing high prices, Albright & Wilson, the world's biggest producer of purified phosphoric acid, lifted interim pretax profit by 6.3 percent to 32.0 million pounds amid continuing strong competition. In a telephone interview with Reuters, chief executive Robin Paul said raw material costs added 40 million stg to bills in 1995 as a whole. "That has now plateaued, but there is no significant benefit from them coming back."
GCAT	At least four people were killed and several injured on Friday when police opened fire on a violent mob in India's commercial hub of Bombay, police officials said. They said the situation was later brought under control at Ghatkopar, about 15 km (10 miles) from the city centre.   Police said trouble started when a statue of leader Bhimrao Ambedkar, known as the father of the Indian constitution, was found garlanded with shoes, viewed as an insulting gesture. A mob surrounded the statue and pelted police with stones when they tried to push through the crowd to the statue. The mob held up traffic on a busy highway during the morning rush hour and set fire to at least two private vehicles, police said. Ambedkar is treated like a god by lower classes in India's rigid Hindu caste society.
MCAT	**  (1005 GMT) - Bombay shares end higher on fund purchases in index-linked stocks and aided by a technical correction, traders say **  30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) closes 71.89 points or 2.15 percent higher at provisional 3419.26 **  50-stock index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) ends 25.04 points or 2.58 percent up at provisional 996.04 **  State Bank of India jumps sharply across India as speculators build long positions ahead of the bank's GDR pricing next month. Funds pick the stock in early session **  Calcutta operators square positions on last day --   Bombay shares finished higher on fund purchases in index-linked stocks and aided by a technical correction, traders said. They said hectic bids in shares of India's largest commercial bank State Bank of India and truckmaker TELCO drove prices to end higher and cheered the mood. Last week, the BSE index slumped 160.70 points or some five percent to 3347.37 after the government failed to deliver anticipated tax reliefs. The Bombay bourse was shut on Monday and Tuesday for Hindu festivals.   Traders said foreign funds were large buyers in SBI shares in the early session. SBI shares have fallen more than 13 percent on the BSE and NSE in the last two months. They said operators in Bombay were building long positions ahead of SBI's $400 million GDR issue pricing next month. "Some funds who missed out at the lower levels stepped in at 250/55 rupee levels but then speculators jumped on the bandwagon and the price shot up," said a trader at a foreign brokerage. Shares of truckmaker TELCO jumped 28.25 rupees or 6.2 percent to 480.75 on the BSE and shot up 29.90 rupees or 6.6 percent on the NSE on news of higher August sales.   Traders said newspaper reports of a slowdown in TELCO's vehicle sales were likely to be proved incorrect when India's monthly auto figures are released later this month. They said TELCO was likely to see a 19 percent growth in August sales from the year ago.

ECAT	A spokesman for the Office of Budget and Mangement (OMB), the White House bureau that drafts the president's budget, said on Thursday it received the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) economic assumptions. "We received the CBO economic assumptions late this afternoon and we are obviously looking at them with interest," the spokesman said. "They are important, in the sense that the more we know, and the sooner we know it, the more we will understand the difference in the OMB and CBO starting points."   "But we don't have the technical assumptions yet and we don't have the deficit baseline," he added. "We welcome the economic assumptions but they are only part of the story." The spokesman said that OMB expected to receive the CBO technical assumptions within the next few weeks, and said that if it did not receive them by Christmas it was unlikely to be able to integrate them into the president's fiscal year 1998 budget submission, expected to be published on Feb 3. "If we do not receive by Christmas, we are unlikely to be able to incorporate them in any way," he said. The CBO's economic assumptions lay out forecasts on the economy's growth, inflation and unemployment. The techincal assumptions contain more detailed forecasts that are equally critical for budget planners, including the expected government revenues and projected rates of growth in key goverment programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

CCAT	Transport group TNT Ltd said on Wednesday its airline group Ansett Holdings Ltd made a net profit after tax but before abnormal items of A$1.14 million in the year to June 30, down from A$27.20 million in 1994/95. Ansett's profits after abnormals, however, rose to A$19.11 million from A$9.06 million in 1994/95. TNT announced earlier this week it would receive cash receipts of A$325 million for the sale of its 50 percent stake in Ansett to Air New Zealand Ltd.   The Ansett profit figures obtained from TNT's accounts conflict with the brief commentary in News Corp Ltd's annual results released last month, which said Ansett made a small loss, but did not specify the size of the loss. News Corp owns 50 percent of Ansett. A TNT spokesman said the difference was due to a different accounting treatment. The higher profit after abnormal items was due to currency gains, the spokeman said. Analysts have generally said Ansett made a pre-tax and pre-abnormals loss of about A$10 million in 1995/96.
ECAT	Romania, negotiating fresh IMF credits, is to be allowed to extend its ceiling on external debt by $500 million to $3.7 billion, the Fund's chief negotiator for the country said on Wednesday. "The ceiling on external borrowing is going to be increased by half a billion dollars," Poul Thomsen told reporters after the centrist government approved a revised budget maintaining a deficit level approved by the Fund. Thomsen, who has led a month-long mission assessing the government's reform programmes, gave no details on what the increased funding might be used for. Thomsen praised the government's achievements in reducing inflation, stabilising the leu currency, improving the foreign trade balance and increasing foreign exchange reserves. But he sidestepped questions on whether he would recommend to the IMF Board agree to release the second of five $86 million tranches under a 13-month stand-by arrangement. "As far as macro-economic policies are concerned, developments have been very positive. They are exceeding expectations," he said. He said he had to return to Washington and "convince my colleagues that we have an agreement, which is a good agreement and I expect the Board to discuss it in early September." If the Board put off the discussion until later, he said, "this is not a lack of support. It's a problem of scheduling."   But he urged the government to move more quickly to restructure or close down loss-making companies in energy-intensive sectors. "The key of sustainability is to accelerate reforms of loss-making reforms in energy-intensive sectors," he said. "We have to focus now on taking the hard and difficult decisions to start dealing with those big loss-making enterprises that are putting pressure on macro-stabilisation." Inflation is expected to have fallen to less than two percent in July from more than 30 percent in March after prices were liberalised. The central bank has announced foreign exchange are expected to rise to between $3 billion and $4 billion from $1.6 billion at end-July. But ministers acknowledge that revenues from privatisation have been low and that limited progress has been made in shutting down or restructuring lists of chronic loss-making industries and farms.
CCAT	British Airways World Cargo plans to increase its wet lease freighter service between Hong Kong and London to a daily frequency when the territory's new airport opens next year, the airline's area manager for Greater China, Chris Chan, has told Reuters. BA is also planning to step up its three times a week freighter link from Hong Kong to London Gatwick to four times weekly later this year, Chan said in an interview. It now operates Boeing 747-200 freighters wet leased from Atlas Air in addition to sizeable belly capacity aboard 14 Boeing 747-400 passenger flights a week to Heathrow. Wet leasing involves the supply of an aircraft with crew, fuel, supplies and supporting services. The proposed daily freighter service from Hong Kong could be switched to Heathrow where BA is building a new dedicated terminal provided suitable slots become available, Chan added. "We are hoping to start the fourth weekly frequency late this summer and a daily service from next year as we continue to expand. Three years ago we started with zero now we have three freighters a week with the prospect of more to come," Chan said. BA said it currently enjoys a 12 percent market share of shipments from Hong Kong to Europe and 45 per cent to the UK and Ireland. --Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7016 Fax 5017
CCAT	American Greetings Corp said Wednesday its electronic marketing division, CreataCard, will introduce in September three service products available through the Internet and computer CD-ROMS.

CCAT	Northwest Pipeline Corp said on Sunday it did not expect any service disruptions as a result of a rupture and explosion on a natural gas transmission pipeline in Washington state. The 26-inch diameter pipeline ruptured late on Saturday night in a sparsely-populated area near Bellingham, 70 miles (110 kms) north of Seattle, local officials said. The natural gas exploded, sending flames leaping hundreds of feet into the air, Neil Clement, deputy director of Whatcom County Division of Emergency Management, said. The flames were "extremely spectacular," he said.   Clement said there were no injuries and damage appeared to be limited to the pipeline. He said there were no mandatory evacuations although a few people in nearby homes chose to leave. Crews quickly shut off valves on both sides of the rupture, stopping the natural gas flow to the affected part of the line, officials said. The remaining gas in the section of pipeline burned itself out during the night. The cause of the rupture was under investigation, said Northwest Pipeline, which operates the pipeline.   Northwest Pipeline spokesman John Nicksich said the company was one of the main providers of natural gas to the cities of the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The affected pipeline carried natural gas from Canada, he said. The company said it operates a 30-inch pipeline that runs parallel to the damaged line. "Northwest switched natural gas service to the 30-inch line and service to local gas customers was not disrupted. The company does not anticipate any service disruptions," the company said in a statement.   "The company has secured the area near the rupture and crews are evaluating the 30-inch line to ensure its continued safe operation. As soon as the evaluation is complete, Northwest will begin the necessary repairs to ensure the damaged pipeline can be put back into operation as quickly as possible," it said. Nicksich said that if no problems were found with the 30- inch pipeline, the company would increase pressure along that pipeline. If there were any shortfalls of natural gas, they could be made up with stored gas, he said. He said it would be Monday evening at the earliest before the 26-inch pipeline could be repaired and back in operation. Northwest, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, operates a 4,000-mile (6,400-km) high-pressure natural gas transmission system that originates in the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico and extends to the U.S.-Canadian border.

MCAT	Despite higher U.S. Treasury yields corporate debt offerings continue to pour into the market as issuers rush to square away business ahead of next week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), dealers said. "The tone is still very upbeat as evidenced by the number of deals we continue to see," said one syndicate source. "Basically, people are looking to get business done now." Dealers said issuers are rushing to get their financing done now as the threat of rising interst rates looms over the market.   Just a week ago, the yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond closed at a 6.85 percent level, currently the yield on the bond stands at 6.96 percent making it more expensive for U.S. corporations to finance debt. The FOMC, the policy setting arm of the Federal Reserve Board, is scheduled to meet on March 25th to vote on monetary policy. Dealers said that despite higher borrowing costs corporations have opted to issue now, rather than later, as demand for paper continues to be very strong.   Leading the investment-grade parade in the new issue market is a $300 million deal for Petro Geo-Services. The offering is expected to consist of Baa3/BBB-minus rated 10-year senior unsecured notes. Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities will act as lead underwriter for the deal. Also, Fletcher Challenge is expected to tap the market with a $320 million Baa2/BBB rated debt offering via Merrill Lynch & Co. The deal is expected to consist of $200 million in 10-year debt and $120 million in 20-year debt, sources said.   In addition, Korea Export-Import Bank is expected to issue $500 million in an A1-A-minus rated global 10-year issue, putable in the fifth year, sources said. Price talk on the issue is 48 basis points over U.S. Treasuries. Lehman Brothers is expected to underwrite the deal. Also, getting set to tap the market is Cooper Tire & Rubber Co, with a $200 million 30-year noncallable debt offering via Merrill Lynch & Co, sources said. Meanwhile, another $2.0 billion in high-yield debt offering are expected to hit the market as well, dealer added.   The B2/B-plus rated deal consists of $200 million in 10-year senior notes and $250 million (proceeds) of 10-year senior discount notes. Another $150 million is expected to come from Titan Wheel International. The offering is expected to include $150 million in B1/BB-minus rated senior subordinated notes due 2007 via Merrill Lynch & Co. Among private placement debt offerings, Borg-Warner Security Corp is expected to issue $125 million in 10-year 144A senior subordinated notes via Merrill Lynch & Co.   EV International is expected to set $100 million in 10-year 144A senior subordinated notes via Chase Securities. Key Plastics Inc is expected to bring $125 million in B3/B-minus rated 144A senior subordinated notes due 2007 via Lehman Brothers. Also, Prime Hospitality Corp is expected to tap the market with $200 million in B1/B-plus rated 144A senior subordinated notes due 2007 via Merrill Lynch & Co. Spanish Broadcasting System Inc is also expected to issue a $250 million in two-part 144A debt offering via sole manager CIBC Wood Gundy. The deal consist of $75 million in senior notes due 2004 and $175 million in senior exchange PIK preferred securities. STC Broadcasting Inc is also expected to issue $85 million in 10-year 144A senior subordinated notes via Chase Securities. ((--Nancy Leinfuss, 212-859-1675))

ECAT	Swiss National Bank chairman Hans Meyer said in an interview with a Swiss news agency that he expected Swiss growth to reach 1.5 percent in 1998. This would follow growth expected at 0.5 percent in 1997. He said that growth was expected to return gradually to a level of 2.0 percent by the start of the century. Meyer made his comments in an interview with Swiss news agency SDA, an SNB spokesman said. The interview was conducted on Wednesday. The SNB has said in the past that it expected growth of 0.5 percent in 1997, and also has said that it expected further improvements in 1998. Price stability, low interest rates, and the Swiss franc's decline were seen as creating a positive basis for growth. Major impetus was also expected to come from stronger growth in neighboring countries. Meyer has already said such factors are likely to help the economy, including the fact that the Swiss franc is roughly 10 percent lower than it was a year ago. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340

MCAT	Profit taking continued to weigh on CME lumber futures but prices ended only slightly lower as strong cash markets underpinned futures, traders said. The same pattern of the past few days persisted with futures declining early on the profit taking before firming late. There was cash-related buying late from people who want to take delivery of the September contract, they said. Cash sources noted that although the cash market is generally quiet, prices remain firm on demand for prompt delivery wood, they added. Random Lengths quoted cash spruce at $419 per tbf, up $5 from last Friday and $7 over the last midweek quote. Reduced concern over Hurricane Edouard prompted some of the early profit taking. Expectations the storm would turn more to the north partly eased concerns, they said. Lumber closed $2.20 to $0.20 per tbf lower with September off $0.70 at $413.20 and November off most at $369.00 per tbf. --Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725
MCAT	Slovenia's blue-chip SBI index extended its record-breaking streak on Monday by rising 0.76 percent to close at a record high for the fourth session. Traders said the market was powered higher by insatiable demand for drug company Lek. The SBI index closed at 1,655.35 points, up 12.49 points -- and a hefty 40 percent since the beginning of the year. Lek, which has already surged over 140 percent since its listing five months ago, jumped another 1.82 percent to 34,200 tolars on volume of 5,234 shares. Lek was also the most actively traded share on the SBI with turnover of 5,234 lots. "Lek was pushed up by the good performance of its rival Krka, whose shares were listed on the OTC market today," one trader said. Krka closed at 26,010 tolars, well above the 7,043 tolars the bulk of shares were sold at during privatisation. Krka notched up staggering turnover of 26,485 shares on the over-the-counter market. "Lek and Krka are both expected to rise in the next couple of weeks due to expectations of good business results and large foreign and domestic demand," the trader added. Overall market turnover fell to 478.5 million tolars from 480.2 million, with six shares advancing, nine falling, one unchanged, and nine untraded. Trading company Kovinotehna was the biggest gainer, firming 4.13 percent to 580 tolars on volume of 1,926 shares. Brokerage Dadas led the day's decliners, falling 6.37 percent to 7,350 tolars on volume of 92 shares.
CCAT	South African fuels and chemicals group Sasol Ltd said on Tuesday it had clinched a strategic alliance with Dow Chemical Co Inc of the U.S. to supply it with comonomer into the next century.   Under the first phase of the progamme, which will commence immediately, Sasol will construct a 50,000 tonnes-a-year plant at a cost of $50 million at its Secunda chemicals complex east of Johannesburg. Production is scheduled to start up in the first quarter of 1999.   Sasol said it had concluded a long-term supply agreement with Dow for the entire output of the chemical building block from this first production unit. "This agreement forms the beginning of a strategic alliance between Dow and Sasol for the supply of comononer into the next millenium," Sasol said in a statement. Plans are also underway to build a second 50,000-tonne plant, scheduled for start-up in 2001. Dow will use the production to ensure a long-term supply of comonomer as it grows its polymer business worldwide. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003
ECAT	Ireland's government on Monday hailed 1996 trade figures which showed record exports and a record trade surplus but pledged to broaden the country's export base by encouraging smaller firms. Figures released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) showed an increase in Ireland's trade surplus to 7.34 billion Irish pounds in 1996 from 7.21 billion in 1995. The value of exports climbed to 30.01 billion pounds from 27.82 billion the previous year, while imports rose to 22.35 billion from 20.62 billion, the CSO said. "Both the figure for total exports and the trade surplus are records and they further underline the present outstanding health of our economy," trade minister Enda Kenny said in a statement. "The surplus...is more than the combined surpluses for the first three years of this decade." He said the government would focus its attention on boosting the exports of smaller and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as exports are dominated by large firms, with 10 companies accounting for 25 percent of Irish exports. "The government's export promotion focus will continue to be on indigenous firms, especially SMEs, which have their own star performers but where the exporting base needs to be broadened," Kenny said. -- Dublin newsroom +353 1 661 3377
MCAT	German shares were lifted to new record levels on Monday on the back of the dollar's ongoing strength against the mark, but demand was weak as attention focused on Tuesday's U.S. Federal Open Market Committee. The blue chip DAX-30 index ended the floor session up 27.14 points, or 0.9 percent, at an all-time high of 3,062.29 while March DTB DAX futures were up 20.5 points at 3,069.5. Dealers warned that the gains were achieved on relatively thin volumes, mainly led by dollar-sensitive firms like Daimler-Benz AG as the U.S. currency traded firmly above 1.64 marks, but said the broader market was cautious. "The Bund (debt) market had already by last week factored in the impact of a small rise in interest rates. We think the outlook from this (FOMC) meeting will be neutral now," one trader said. Daimler advanced 3.60 marks, or three percent, to 119.10 marks while Siemens AG also gained three percent to 82.23 marks. A strong 1995/1996 earnings report pushed Metallgesellschaft stock up one mark to 33.80 marks. The diversified engineering and trading company reported an 86.4 percent rise in net earnings Shares in utilities Veba AG and RWE AG fell against the trend after a British newspaper report that Cable & Wireless Plc was planning to exit its telecom alliance with them. The Times earlier on Monday reported that the British group was looking to abandon its alliance with the two. Veba fell 90 pfennigs to 89.70 while RWE slipped 95 pfennigs to 68.35. Dealers said the report had prompted some profit-taking in the German utility sector that had recently been setting in after a strong bull run in the sector. Builder Hochtief lost early gains after denying a report that it planned to "pool" its 20 percent stake in rival Holzmann with a shareholding owned by Deutsche Bank in a bid to increase its control on its close competitor. Hochtief ended down 60 pfennigs at 66.10 while Holzmann rose six marks to 424. Software group SAP continued its rise after last week's strong 1996 figures, rising nine marks to 255.0.
ECAT	French welfare debt repayment fund CADES said on Friday it will offer between 8 billlion and 10 billion francs of its 2002, 2005 and 2007 bonds at auction next Wednesday.   The amount was broadly in line with expectations. Market sources had said earlier on Friday they expected the broad range to be from eight billion to 12 billion francs. The statement did not give any indication of how much of each bond CADES hoped to sell although the fund has set a minimum sale of one billion francs for each line. Some analysts said the 2002 and 2005 bonds would attract most interest, although one said the 2007 bond has been popular among domestic investors recently.   There are currently 14 billion francs of the 5.5 percent 2002 bond, 12 billion francs of the 6.00 percent 2005 and 11 billion francs of the 6.25 percent 2007 bond outstanding. All bonds were initially issued with a yield spread of seven basis points over French government bonds. Most primary dealers were quoting the 2002 and the 2007 bonds at a spread below seven on Friday. -- Paris Newsroom +331 4221 5542
ECAT	Silf and Swedbank said on Tuesday that their purchasing managers' index was unchanged at 55.5 in March, the same level as February.   "The upturn in the industrial cycle is continuing accordingly but without further acceleration," Silf and Swedbank said in a statement. The index in January was 53.3 and in March 1996 46.4. The statement said the order intake was continuing to show a divided picture but was still better in the first quarter of 1997 than in the same period a year ago with positive developments. The index for order intake was 57.0 in March against 59.4 in February but compared to 47.0 in March last year. "It is still orders from exports that are dragging while the home market is not far from becoming stagnant," they said. Silf and Swedbank said the most negative aspect in March was still falling employment. "Despite increased production, unemployment in the industrial sector continues to fall," the statement said. The production index rose to 59.7 in March against 59.4 in Feburary and 50.0 a year earlier. -- Belinda Goldsmith, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1017
GCAT	The Albanian ambassador to Rome told Reuters on Sunday that more than 80 people were believed to have died when a refugee boat sank on Friday night. Pandeli Pasko said he had compiled a list of missing people after talking to survivors in the southern Italian port of Brindisi on Saturday. According to his figures, between 120 and 130 people were on the boat and only 34 were rescued.   "I spoke to all but two of the survivors individually and they told me who was with them," Pasko said in a telephone interview. "We made up a list as best we could. "My God, what a tragedy." A list of names faxed to Reuters by the Albanian embassy referred to 79 missing people, many of them women and children and some identified merely as "a friend". But Pasko said it was not definitive and he had still to speak to two of the survivors rescued on Friday after the ancient harbour patrol craft collided with a navy ship trying to prevent it entering Italian waters in the Adriatic.
GCAT	After two weeks of partisan wrangling, the Senate on Wednesday confirmed President Bill Clinton's nomination of Alexis Herman as labor secretary, a cabinet office that has been vacant for three and a half months. The Senate's Republican leaders took the confirmation vote soon after a deal was cut in which the Clinton administration agreed to drop a planned executive order on using project labor agreements for federal construction projects that business groups said would discriminate against non-union contractors. Instead, the White House will issue a memorandum to federal agencies that it said will achieve the same purpose as the order, but which business groups called a major concession. Herman, 49, who had been director of the White House Office of Public Liaison, was confirmed on a 85-13 vote. She succeeds Robert Reich, who left the Labor Department on Jan. 12 after four years. Clinton lauded the Senate's strong backing of Herman. "There was never any question that she was highly qualified to be secretary of labor," the president said in a statement. "She understands the needs of workers and understands the challenges they face as we approach the 21st century." Herman, the first black woman to head the department, won a unanimous recommendation by the Senate Labor Committee on April 10 after undergoing months of scrutiny over her links to President Clinton's re-election campaign fundraising efforts. But Senate Republican leaders halted the confirmation process about two weeks ago after a draft of the proposed presidential order surfaced. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney charged that the standoff was calculated by Republicans to keep the Labor Department rudderless for a longer period of time. "By dragging their feet with one partisan excuse after another, the Republican Senate leadership has kept the Labor Department without a new leader for four months," he said. Project labor agreements are deals negotiated by contractors and unions before the start of a project that cover wages and terms and conditions of employment for the duration of the project. Republicans, prodded by business groups, objected to the order, arguing that it was a payoff to unions for their vigorous political support of Clinton and many Democratic candidates and that it amounted to a mandate for federal agencies to use union workers and contractors. The administration, however, maintained that the order was within the president's authority to issue, was entirely voluntary for federal agencies and would not require them to channel the government's $60 billion a year construction budget exclusively to union contractors and workers. In agreeing to issue a memorandum instead of an order, White House spokesman Barry Toiv said the administration conceded only on the duration of its message. Memoranda last only for the duration of the president's term, while executive orders remain in effect afterwards, he said. "Since this is something to encourage agencies rather than be mandatory for agencies, we believe it substantively accomplishes the same goal," said Toiv. But business groups claimed victory, saying the memorandum would not have same effect of requiring agencies to use union labor that they said the executive order would have. "The withdrawal of this proposed executive order is an outright victory for American taxpayers, construction workers and businesses," said U.S. Chamber of Commerce Senior Vice President Bruce Josten. "It is a repudiation of big labor's attempt to buy, with political contributions, a union monopoly of government construction projects." One business group official said the memorandum was "in effect a fig leaf given to the unions that didn't carry the same force as an executive order." But Democrats and union officials said they were pleased with the deal, which they said kept the original intent of the executive order intact. "We're seeing a very energetic spin control effort on the Republican side," said Gerry Shea, an assistant to Sweeney. "This was not an attempt to force an agency to do it. It's an effort to say there's no problem with doing it." Senate Deputy Republican leader Don Nickles of Oklahoma, his party's point man on the issue, said the administration's memorandum will remind federal agencies that project labor agreements may legally be used if justified by time, cost and labor-management stability considerations.
ECAT	South Africa has no plans to expand significantly its foreign debt portfolio, finance department director-general Maria Ramos said on Tuesday. "At the moment only 4.2 percent of our portfolio is in anything but rands and we will be managing it next year to keep it at around those ratios," she told reporters. "It may be marginally up, it may be marginally down, we don't have any plans to expand our foreign debt portfolio in any massive way."   Ramos said the government had no need to raise more funds offshore. "We actually don't need to because we can finance the entire deficit domestically. We have done these issues for reasons of other strategies, benchmarking, extending the maturity of the profile of the existing debt," she said. Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said that government had now completed its plans to raise 2.5 billion rand of its borrowing requirement offshore. In September, South Africa issued a seven-year 500 million mark issue at a 140 basis points above equivalent German government issues. On October 11, the country issued a $300 million 10-year Yankee bond at 195 basis points above the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond. -- Lynda Loxton, Cape Town newsroom, +27 21 252-238
CCAT	- How many of us in the business world have ever paused at work in mid-career to ask ourselves, "Whatever happened to my dream?" For those who have forgotten their dreams, management author Allan Cox, chairman of Berryman Communications Co. in Chicago, says we are not alone, that "everybody has the potential of getting lost, no matter who they are or where they are." "I think that virtually every executive as he or she moves through their career loses touch with what we care about, the things where our heart was when we were 14 or 15 years old," Cox asserted. "With the mortgage payments, the child-rearing, the career climb, by the time you get into your 30s or 40s, (our dreams) have gotten buried," he said. "At some point we need to reclaim them, to re-examine who we are." So when his publisher asked him to write another book about teamwork, Cox replied, "I'd rather do a book on human purpose, that you can't be good at what you do if you don't care and that you can't care if you're not authentic." In "Redefining Corporate Soul: Linking Purpose & People" (Irwin, $24.95), Cox says that everywhere he goes, he finds "people trying to reconnect with authenticity." "...There's a desire on their part to rediscover what they care about, so that caring can be turned toward doing a job that they'd love to do." Those who don't, Cox said, "don't serve their company and themselves well" and slip into boredom, depression, and alcoholism "because they don't have any joy in life." "Instead of saying, 'I don't like what I'm doing,' Cox writes, "employees need to ask themselves: 'What does my company want to have done? Am I the person to do it? Is this the time it should be done?' and 'With whom do I team up to get it done?'" Much of what constitutes authentic vision, Cox said, comes to us intuitively, in what longshoreman-philosopher Eric Hoffer called "flashes." "If we do not know how to capture the flashes, we are without growth and exhilaration," Hoffer said. Cox advises people to heed, and act upon, these insights. "Let's face it," he writes. "I'm more alive, spontaneous, and relaxed when I'm on the beam, when I'm locked into something bigger than I am. And it requires less effort to be yourself than to be something you're not." Just like people, Cox reflects, corporations, too, must wrestle with authenticity. "When a company gets caught up in what it thinks it ought to be, 'me-tooism,' or imitation or responding to what their competition is doing, it can lose contact with its purpose." "You might make gourmet bread, widgets, diesel engines or fax machines. You might offer phone service, hotel rooms or overnight package delivery," Cox writes. "The issues are the same." -- Do you and your employees have fun at work? -- Do you get a lift from doing a great job, from figuring out a client's problem? -- Do you remember what got you excited in the first place? -- Is yours a company that cares for its people and their futures? -- Are your people, and you, rededicated every day to a positive business purpose or are you all just picking up a paycheck? Businesses like Procter & Gamble, 3M, Motorola, and Wal-Mart -- whose stocks outperform their competitors -- have leaders with "here-and-now contact with their own authenticity, their corporate soul," Cox contended. The successful company, Cox concludes, must foster "resonance," by merging its mission "with the individual missions of its people." This is done by redefining corporate soul: "the contact that makes you come face to face with your real purpose."

ECAT	Debt growth in nonfinancial sectors of the U.S. economy slowed to a 4.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter from a revised 6.3 percent rise in the first quarter, the Federal Reserve said Thursday. Nonfinancial debt includes all the obligations of U.S. households, governments and businesses but excludes financial companies like banks, mortgage and finance companies. A major reason for slower second-quarter growth was that federal government debt advanced only at a 1.7 percent annual rate, down sharply from a 6.6 percent first-quarter rate of increase.   Previously, the Fed said total nonfinancial sector debt had grown at a 6.2 percent annual rate in the first three months of this year but it revised that estimate up slightly to 6.3 percent. During the second quarter, household debt growth eased to a 7.6 percent annual rate of increase from 8.7 percent in the first quarter. The Fed said borrowing in home mortgage and consumer credit markets was lower in the second quarter. Business debt growth fell to 4.7 percent a year in the second quarter from five percent in the first quarter.   "Issuance of coporate bonds strengthened but businesses reduced their borrowing from other sources, including banks and the commercial paper market," the Fed said. The one sector where debt grew quickly in the second quarter was state and local governments, whose debts climbed at a 3.5 percent annual rate after shrinking in the first quarter at a 1.2 percent rate. The Fed said state and local governments were issuing tax-exempt securities faster than they paid them off. At the end of the second quarter, the level of domestic nonfinancial debt was $14.3 trillion. The federal government's share of the total was $3.7 trillion while nonfederal sectors owed $10.6 trillion.

GCAT	A bribery scandal over a former South Korean defence minister has cast a pall over a military establishment already troubled by a legacy of corruption and accusations of security loopholes, analysts said on Sunday. South Korea, its image already tainted by bribery scandals involving two former presidents, was hit by a fresh scandal on Saturday over a defence minister who lost his job in a sweeping ministry reshuffle on Thursday. President Kim has launched an investigation into allegations of bribery against the former defence chief, Lee Yang-ho, who was replaced by retired four-star army general Kim Dong-jin in the shakeup that carved deep into the military's top brass. Lee has denied the charge brought by the main opposition party that he leaked classified military information on a combat helicopter project to an arms dealer in 1995 in return for 150 million won ($181,000) in bribes. But the investigation is the latest in a string of setbacks for the military, which has undergone a radical face-lift since Kim took office in February 1993 under a crusade to root out corruption and end Seoul's legacy of military-backed rule. Kim, the first civilian president in three decades, has attempted to cleanse South Korean politics by retiring generals tainted with scandals and shady deals, arresting officers on charges of bribery and pushing out defence ministers. But some critics say the purge has syphoned away expertise in the military at a time of escalating threats and provocations from communist North Korea, creating loopholes in national security that Pyongyang has recently exploited. Recent criticisms focus on the failure to detect a North Korean Shark-class submarine which glided unnoticed last month through South Korean defences to deliver 26 agents into a sparsely populated area on South Korea's east coast. The vessel may have sailed home, mission accomplished, had not an alert taxi driver spotted its coning tower looming out of the darkness off a beach. The agents fled into nearby mountains where 22 were killed by southern troops or found dead and one was captured alive. The military's failure in a subsequent hunt by thousands of southern troops to find the remaining three, who are suspected of killing three villagers, further undermined confidence. On September 23, only five days after the submarine was discovered, a South Korean army deserter was captured after opening fire and wounding nine of his fellow soldiers. "People have been in a worrisome state after seeing the submarine incursion, along with little progress in the manhunt for the following one month and a desertion case," the Joong-Ang Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial this week. Lee, whose removal from the defence post along with a shift in the commanders of all three South Korean armies last week, was widely seen as a response by President Kim to restore confidence in the military by ushering in new blood. But Kim faces an uphill task. His military suffered another embarassment only five months before the submarine incident when a North Korean air force captain who defected in an ageing Soviet-built fighter exposed gaping security holes in South Korea's air defences. A series of security lapses allowed Li Chol-su's Mig-19 to scream towards Seoul without raising any alarm in the capital. He was eventually intercepted by several southern fighters which guided him to a military air field. At the time, Seoul's mayor apologised for the failure and stripped three civil defence officials of their positions.
GCAT	U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her South Korean counterpart confirmed on Saturday that preliminary peace talks with North Korea would take place next month in New York. Albright and South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong told a news conference in Seoul that their governments had agreed to meet North Korean representatives on March 5 to discuss a proposal for four-party talks including China to work for a lasting peace on the divided peninsula. They spoke after several hours of talks held against the backdrop of dramatic changes in the reclusive North Korean leadership. Earlier in the day Pyongyang announced the death of its powerful defence minister, Choe Kwang. He was the third top official to disappear from the Stalinist state's ruling hierarchy in 10 days following the defection of a leading ideologue to the South on February 12 and Friday's news that premier Kang Song-san was being replaced. South Korean officials believe the changes will lead to a major shake-up in Pyongyang's ruling elite at a time of heightened tensions on the peninsula. At Saturday's news conference Yoo described the North Korean situation as "volatile", adding: "We have to avoid any active and armed clashes" between the two sides. Albright, who had earlier flown to Seoul after a whirlwind tour of major European capitals, told the conference: "I am pleased to announce that we have agreed with North Korea on a joint Republic of Korea-U.S. briefing about our presidents' proposal to conduct four-party peace talks which will take place on March 5 in New York." North Korea had announced the "briefing" plans on Friday but U.S. officials refused to confirm the meeting until after Albright's talks in Seoul with President Kim Young-sam and Yoo. U.S. and South Korean officials were burned twice before when Pyongyang scheduled and then cancelled the briefing, deemed a necessary preliminary step to substantive peace talks. A senior U.S. official acknowledged there was no certainty the North Koreans would attend this time until they actually showed up in New York. But he said that previously, Pyongyang had played "hard to get" on the briefing issue and this time "they acknowledge they want to come to this meeting". Albright and Yoo also reaffirmed support for the 1994 agreement under which Washington and Seoul would provide $5 billion in light-water nuclear reactors to North Korea in return for Pyongyang freezing its nuclear programme. Yoo said North Korea's desire to improve its devastated Stalinist economy was the "most obvious answer" to why Pyongang had now agreed to attend the New York briefing. The New York Times in an editorial on Saturday accused South Korea of deliberately fanning tensions with North Korea. The senior official said he did not agree. When North Korea announced on Friday that it would attend the briefing, some analysts saw it as a sign the communist North was trying to put on a normal face after the embarrassing defection of top ideologue Hwang Jang-yop, currently hol;ed up in Seoul's Beijing mission. North Korea had twice in the past month put off attending a peace talks "briefing" in what was seen as an effort to press Washington to provide more food aid for its hungry population. Washington insists it never promised Pyongyang a specific amount of food aid in return for the Stalinist regime's participation in the briefing. Pyongyang reneged on its promise to attend earlier briefings when it was unable to close on a deal with U.S.-based Cargill Inc. on 500,000 tonnes of grain. That deal still has not been completed. This week, however, the United States and South Korea acted to alleviate the North's food needs by pledging $10 million and $6 million in new assistance, respectively, through the World Food Programme, a United Nations agency. Washington and Seoul proposed the four-way talks last April to defuse tensions -- and eventually bring about a permanent peace -- on the peninsula. The two Koreas remain technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace pact. Asked if North Korea was manipulating the United States and South Korea with its erratic behaviour, Albright said: "I believe no country plans a famine and to be the beggar on the international stage." Yoo said South Korea's food shortage is "one of the important issues that we are dealing with". Once Pyongyang came to the peace talks, he added, serious discussions about larger food assistance could take place. After her talks with Yoo and President Kim Young-sam, Albright was due to visit the demilitarised zone between North and South, where 37,000 U.S. troops help keep the uneasy peace.

CCAT	The U.S. sugar confectionery market has slowly convinced consumers of its advantages over chocolate by using products low in fat and sugar, management consultant Datamonitor said. "Sugar confectionery manufacturers have seen the future and it is low fat," it said in a statement issued on Monday. Citing its new report "U.S. confectionery 1997", Datamonitor said sugar confectionery had increased its market share partly because the chocolate category was regarded unfavourably from a health standpoint. It had also been been slow to react to the burgeoning low fat market, the statement said. While chocolate still accounted for the lion's share of the confectionery market at around 60 percent, the approximate 20-percent share of sugar-based products had gradually risen since 1992, a Datamonitor chart showed. Gum accounted for most of the remaining share. Sugar confectioners had developed new products to cater for the health market while the chocolate category lacked low-fat products, thus presenting producers with the problem of balancing taste and content, it said. Datamonitor noted that four manufacturers -- Hershey Foods Corp, M&M/Mars, Nestle SA and Brach -- controlled more than 75 percent of the U.S. confectionery market and were keeping private label sales to a minimum. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8064

GCAT	South Korea said on Wednesday it had failed to break a deadlock in talks with China over the fate of a senior North Korean defector stranded in Seoul's Beijing mission, despite signs that Pyongyang had softened its stance. Separately, South Korea's ruling party chairman said Seoul must re-think its unification policy towards the North. Lee Hong-koo of the New Korea Party said food shortages and economic woes were driving the North into a final crisis. He said the defection by top ideologue Hwang Jang-yop was pushing the North Korean leadership deeper into desperation. A Foreign Ministry spokesman denied a Japanese newspaper report that China and South Korea had agreed that Hwang, ranked 24th in Pyongyang's hierarchy, could leave Beijing for asylum in South Korea as early as this week. "Unfortunately, we have not made any real progress in our talks with China and it is too early to talk about when Hwang could leave Beijing," spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung told Reuters. Another Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to be identified, said: "He is not likely to leave within a few days. It could be weeks before Hwang can secure his departure." Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that Seoul and Beijing had "basically agreed to transfer Hwang" to South Korea. "The Yomiuri report is not true," the spokesman said. "Our talks with China are still at an initial stage." Hwang has taken refuge at the heavily-guarded South Korean consular office in Beijing for eight days. Foreign Ministry officials said Hwang's fate could be decided only between Seoul and Beijing, while China maintained it was desirable that Hwang's case be resolved through dialogue between North and South Korea. Signs have emerged that North Korea might be ready to give up the fight to recover Hwang, possibly as a result of mediation by Beijing to end the Cold War crisis in its backyard. The softer tone was first set when Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry said on Monday it would dismiss Hwang if he defected. Japan's economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported on Wednesday that Kim Jong-u, head of North Korea's Overseas Economic Cooperation Committee, told a meeting with financial officials in China that Pyongyang had already dismissed Hwang. The newspaper quoted sources at the meeting as saying that Kim Jong-u was asked if North Korea accepted Hwang's defection. He replied: "That is what the government has decided. The matter is already closed. He has already been dismissed." Lee from Seoul's ruling party said Hwang must be granted political asylum in South Korea as he wished, but urged the South Korean media and citizens to be cautious and patient. He said Pyongyang's woes would remain a headache for Seoul. Apart from Hwang, many other North Koreans who had fled the North were waiting to defect to South Korea, he said. "Severe food shortages and economic difficulties are driving the North Korean system to an irreversible final crisis," Lee told parliament. "In view of North Korea's rapid breaking away from its orbit and its plunge, we must drastically review our unification policy." Lee said Seoul's policy of seeking reunification of the Korean peninsula by treating the North as an equal partner might have to be abandoned. He did not elaborate but a senior New Korea Party official told Reuters the party chairman was stressing the need to brace South Korea for a possible collapse of the North. The two Koreas remain technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce and not a peace agreement.

ECAT	Ministers from 128 countries gathered in Singapore on Sunday for a week-long conference aimed at agreeing an agenda to push the world towards global free trade in the 21st century. But they hold widely differing views on the next steps they need to take to get there and on how to tackle the social and political problems thrown up by the growing integration of the international economy. The gathering in this booming Asian city-state is the first Ministerial Conference of the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation (WTO), launched two years ago to replace the 47-year-old old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero says he is sure the meeting will give a major boost to a wider opening of world markets. The Ministerial is also being attended by officials from 28 other states including China and Russia waiting to enter the organisation, which has just admitted three new members to bring the total to 128. In a letter to Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong who will chair the gathering, the WTO's supreme authority, Ruggiero said Geneva negotiations on a declaration to be issued by the ministers provided a "solid base" for accord. And he has made clear he hopes to see firm movement in private ministerial talks towards multi-billion dollar pacts on freeing trade within the next few years in information technology products and basic telecommunications. But he acknowledged there were difficult decisions to be taken on how to handle controversial "new issues" -- like trade and labour, investment, competition policy and government procurement -- at the heart of much North-South friction. "I am confident that the Declaration that will emerge will be one in which all WTO members can take pride and...can reaffirm their commitment to the great shared undertaking that is the multilateral trading system," Ruggiero's letter said. The declaration is to be issued next Friday and will be a key text guiding the WTO, created by international treaty at the end of the ground-breaking 1986-93 Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations, towards the new century. The big trading powers -- the United States, the European Union, Japan and Canada -- have varying views on what should be in it. But key developing countries, especially in Asia, are determined to keep the "new issues" out. The United States, with some EU support, wants the WTO to start discussing whether its rules should be adjusted to take account of the trading advantage some poorer countries gain from exploiting an unprotected, low-wage labour force. They say the aim is to ensure that "core labour standards" -- including the freedom to set up worker unions and a ban on children in the workplace -- are observed throughout the world. U.S. and EU officials on Sunday told a Singapore meeting of a major global labour union body, the Brussels-based ICFTU, that unless the WTO could be shown to be addressing the question, public support in the West for free trade would evaporate. The ICFTU, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, reflecting Western workers' fears that open markets mean jobs are slipping away to poorer countries, in turn issued a warning that the WTO's credibility was at stake. But representatives of Asian-based development groups at another WTO-linked meeting in Singapore argued that the West -- both workers and governments -- was primarily interested in keeping out cheaper goods from developing countries. Ruggiero himself told the ICFTU meeting he believed common ground could be found on the labour issue. Another controversy at the WTO gathering is expected to swirl around agriculture and how quickly to push ahead with a new round of talks on freeing trade in farm products set in the Uruguay Round to start by the end of the century. Key agricultural producers ranging from Argentina and Australia to Thailand and Uruguay want wording in the declaration allowing for preparations to start soon. But this is resisted by Japan and South Korea -- whose governments faced fierce criticism when they had to slightly open their long-protected rice markets at the end of the Uruguay Round -- and from the EU whose farmers also fear more open markets.

GCAT	Chris Johnson parred the second playoff hole with Leta Lindley to win the the $1.2 million LPGA Championship on Sunday. Johnson bogeyed the 18th hole twice in less than a half-hour, once in regulation to force the playoff and once to keep the playoff going. But Lindley struggled on the second sudden-death hole, the par-4 10th, after sending her tee shot into the trees to the right of the fairway on the par-71 course over 6,386 yards. Lindley, seeking her first career win, missed a 30-foot par putt before the 39-year-old Johnson rolled in a six-footer for her eighth career victory and first since 1995. Two-time U.S. Women's Open champion Annika Sorenstam of Sweden fired a 4-under 67 and grabbed sole possession of third place at 2-under 282. She had a chance to force a three-way playoff, but missed a two-foot par putt on the 18th hole after making a charge on the back nine. Defending champion Laura Davies of Britain failed in a bid for her third victory at this event, although a final-round 68 moved her into a tie for fourth at even-par 284. Sherri Steinhauer, who led after the second round, had a 1-over 72 to join Davies three shots off the lead. The $180,000 first prize moved Johnson into the top five on the 1997 money list with earnings of $335,029. "It wasn't very pretty," Johnson said. "But my putting really helped me, held me together. My problem was with myself (not Lindley)." Lindley and Johnson shared the lead at the start of the day, and both shot even-par 71s for four-round totals of 3-under 281. They were two of only three players to break par for the tournament, the second major championship of the year on the LPGA Tour. The former University of Arizona stars went to just the fourth playoff in the tournament's 42-year history, but bogeyed the first sudden-death hole, the par-4 18th. Johnson chipped within six feet, but had her six-foot-par putt lip out. Lindley chipped four feet past the hole and missed the comebacker for par. Johnson said her career turned around five years ago after working with a golf pro who modified her swing. "There really wasn't a time when I was going to scrap (my career)," she said. "I could stay out here and have a good tournament now and then, wait for that time when it's your week and everything goes your way and God comes down and just says, OK, you're going to win this week.' "I said no, that's not what I want to do. If I'm going to be away from my husband, and if I'm going to travel and if I'm going to come out here, it's not worth it to struggle." Johnson, who earned the biggest paycheck of her 17-year career, grabbed a two-shot lead with a birdie on the par-5 11th hole while Lindley bogeyed. Both players bogeyed the par-3 13th hole, but Lindley recovered with a five-foot birdie at 14 and Johnson bogeyed 18 to set up the playoff. "I handled myself well," said Lindley, whose $111,711 check as runner-up exceeded by $99 her best yearly earnings. "I made a birdie before I made a bogey.  I hit the ball great," she said. "I hit some good putts that hit the hole and didn't fall for me. I did everything that I could and I put myself in an opportunity to win a major championship."
GCAT	Former New Mexico Representative Bill Richardson was sworn in as new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations on Thursday and said he wanted to be a bridge to developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. After taking the oath of office from Vice President Al Gore at a White House ceremony, Richardson also pledged to work to see that the United States pays more than $1 billion in outstanding dues to the world organisation. "The U.N. is important to the United States. I'm a firm believer in the U.N. We must pay our dues there. That is my mandate, that is my mission," he said. Richardson, a Hispanic-American who served as a part-time diplomatic troubleshooter for President Bill Clinton before being named to his new post, said he wanted to be "a bridge to the developing world of Asia, Africa and Latin America." He was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday to replace Madeleine Albright. She became secretary of state last month. Richardson, 49, resigned from Congress shortly before his swearing-in ceremony, leaving the House of Representatives with 227 Republicans, 205 Democrats, one independent and two vacancies. He represented New Mexico's third congressional district, which includes Santa Fe, since 1983. A special election will be scheduled to fill the rest of his two-year term through 1998. Richardson thanked his former constituents as he assumed his new duties and said he hoped "someday, I might represent them again." He said he and his wife, Barbara, planned to leave for New York over the weekend, and that he would be on the job as U.N. envoy on Monday.

MCAT	U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets Monday were at a standstill, with no sales of slaughter steers or heifers reported, feedlot sources said. Packer bids from $63.00 to $64.00 per cwt were passed by owners pricing cattle at $65.00 to mostly $66.00, they said. Feedlot cattle prices this week were expected steady to $1.00 higher, compared with last week's sales at $64.00, the dealers said. Prices were seen lifted by firm beef demand on Friday. Prices also were seen underpinned by lighter-weight cattle, compared with a year ago, and the ability of feedlots to remain current in their marketings, they said.   Support this week also was expected from only slight increases in this week's showlists, sources said. Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma showlists were pegged near 81,000 head, up 2,000 from a week ago, sources there said. Kansas showlists were estimated near 78,500, up 700 from a week ago. Nebraska's showlist was estimated near 82,000 head, down 1,000 from last week. Support in fed cattle prices could be offset by lower to Monday's sharply lower CME live cattle futures and slow beef sales, versus active sales at higher prices on Friday, market sources noted.

MCAT	IPE gas oil futures closed 75 cents down on Monday as negative sentiment overtook the market amid talk that Iraqi crude exports were closer to resuming, brokers said. The July gas oil contract, which expires on Thursday, finished at $161.25 a tonne, three dollars off its intra-day high and nudging significant support around $160-$160.50. IPE Brent was drifting sideways and was down three cents at $18.03 a barrel at 1749 GMT. In New York the front-month WTI contract was at $19.33, down 23 cents on talk that Iraq was due to meet U.N. officials on the details of its aid plan.   "We saw some good end-user buying in the morning on the gas oil but then things slumped and we're at the bottom end of the range," said one broker. IPE Brent business was described as featureless, having slipped into negative territory from its intra-day high of $18.28 a barrel reached on short covering. "We're just drifting, there is nothing happening out there," said one broker. Dealers in New York said prices were weaker because a sell-off last week broke key trendlines throughout the oil complex and generated sell signals on Monday.
CCAT	China's white goods maker Haier Group Company said on Tuesday it would enter the European market in an attempt to challenge the established players in this area. "Haier expects to become a serious competitor in the European market for refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, dryers, micro-wave ovens and air conditioners," the company said in a statement issued in the Netherlands. Qingdao-based Haier is market leader in China with 1996 turnover of 1.5 billion guilders. The company said it is well aware of the particulars of the European market because it has bought its technology from major European producers. Haier has agreed on a partnership with Dutch unlisted import and export firm Epogro BV which will organise its distribution and marketing in Europe. The company will start its European operations this year in the Benelux countries and Germany and will expand in France, Britain and Spain in the next three years. Haier has been active in the U.S. and Australia since the early 1990s, it said. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040

CCAT	Philips Electronics NV said on Wednesday first quarter net profit from ordinary operations rose to 460 million guilders ($239 million) in 1997 from a year-earlier 377 million guilders and said it was on track to achieve its profit targets. Total first-quarter net profit mushroomed to 887 million guilders from a year-earlier 692 million. "The first-quarter results provide us with the confidence that we are on track following the improvement programme started in 1996," Philips said in a statement. "A number of restructuring programmes which are still underway should begin to contribute to profits over the next several quarters," it added. Total first-quarter net was buoyed by an extraordinary gain of 427 million guilders from the partial flotation of its shareholding in ASM Lithography, Philips said. Last year extraordinary gains amounted to 315 million guilders. The net result from normal operations came in ahead of analysts' consensus of 366 million guilders. ($ = 1.925 Dutch Guilders)
GCAT	A United Nations human rights official in Colombia called on the government on Thursday to disband armed civilian groups set up to track leftist rebels. "We have reliable evidence that many of these groups are involving the civilian population directly in the conflict and increasing the level of violence," said Almudena Mazarrasa, U.N. High Commission for Human Rights director for Colombia. She said her office had received information that the legal intelligence-gathering groups, known as Rural Security Cooperatives or Convivirs, had overstepped their powers. Critics say the Convivirs have become vigilante groups, arming themselves with automatic weapons, launching their own fight against the guerrillas and committing human rights abuses on those they suspect of backing the rebels. Colombian and international human rights groups have also accused Convivirs of having close ties to illegal right-wing death squads. The Convivirs were set up early in President Ernesto Samper's administration and assigned the task of working with the military authorities and alerting them of guerrilla movements. Convivir members carry sophisticated communications equipment but are legally only allowed to carry handguns for self-defence, not offensive actions. There are more than 700 Convivirs operating in the country today, and by some estimates there will be more than 1,200 by the end of the year.
ECAT	Economic growth should reach three percent in the 29-country OECD this year, its strongest level in nearly a decade, but Germany and other European Union states run the risk of a "jobless recovery", according to an OECD report. The twice-yearly report by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development predicts non-inflationary growth of 3.0 percent in 1997 and a slightly slower 2.7 percent rise in gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998. The OECD, which has expanded from a grouping of established industrial nations in the 1990s to embrace Mexico, former Soviet bloc countries and South Korea, said over half of its member countries could expect growth on this scale at national level, with the United States and Canada doing relatively better. But the outlook for Japan and major European Union countries, including Germany, France, Italy and some smaller EU nations, is less buoyant due to public spending restraint or other austerity measures and fragile consumer demand, the report says. Unemployment across the 29 countries is expected to fall by about a million to 35.2 million by 1998, with the jobless rate easing to 7.1 percent from 7.5 percent in 1996, but it remains a serious problem in Europe, especially in big continental states. "The weakness of employment growth in much of the European Union may revive questions of whether a 'jobless recovery' is in prospect in some countries, notably Germany," the June Economic Outlook report says. While improving employment often lags an upswing in economic growth, persistent and relatively strong productivity growth in the European Union may be due to high labour costs and intensive capital investment at the expense of labour, it says. The report says OECD economic growth should be helped by the need to meet rising demand in strongly growing non-OECD regions, above all from China and Asian countries. "Expansions appear to be strong and well established, even if they are in some cases now quite mature, in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and most smaller EU countries," the report says of OECD members. "Output has also been rising in Japan, Germany, France, Italy and several smaller EU countries, but at a more hesitant pace," it says. "In the major continental European countries, net exports have been a consistent source of strength, but consumer spending remains weak, while private investment has failed to strengthen much despite lower long-term interest rates." The OECD predicts U.S. economic growth of 3.6 percent this year, followed by a slowdown to two percent growth in 1998. "The economy may begin to slow in the second half of 1997 from its rapid first-half pace as the growth rate of domestic private spending tapers off under the weight of tighter monetary conditions, moderating income increases and the exhaustion of favourable stock adjustment effects," it says. The OECD said it was assuming another rise of a half of one percentage point in the U.S. Federal Funds interest rate "around the middle of 1997", after a quarter percentage point rise to 5.50 percent in March, the first in more than two years. The rise might be needed to slow economic growth, it said. The organisation expects Japanese growth of 2.3 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 1998. In the European Union, the OECD expects the German economy to grow 2.2 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 1998, while it predicts French growth of 2.5 percent this year and 2.8 percent next year. Both countries, along with Italy, will overshoot the deficit reduction target implied by a strict reading of the Maastricht treaty to qualify for a European single currency -- that public deficits must be limited to three percent of GDP. France's new left-wing government wants a more "flexible" reading which is not excluded by the treaty. The OECD says it expects public deficits in Germany, France and Italy to come in at 3.2 percent of GDP in 1997 -- the test year for European monetary union. It predicts Italy's deficit widening the year after but those of Germany and France falling in line with the strict Maastricht interpratation.
ECAT	Guatemala's export revenues in the first quarter of 1997 rose 45 percent over the same time period in 1996, the central bank said Tuesday. Export revenues were $986 million through April 10 this year, compared with $681 million through April 11 last year. "In 1997 there has been an upturn in foreign currency revenues from exports, principally as a result of the rise in coffee sales and the rise in prices for that product," Willy Zapata, president of Banco de Guatemala, told Reuters.   Zapata said foreign currency spending on imports in the first quarter this year rose 42 percent compared with the same period last year. Spending on imports was $969 million through April 10, 1997 compared with $682 million through April 13, 1996. The trade surplus was $17 million for the first quarter of this year compared to a deficit of $1.0 million in the first three months of 1996. (Corrects to make clear year ago first quarter was a deficit, not a surplus). International reserves have grown $150 million "as a result of official and private capital income," to $966 million on April 16 from $815 million on December 31, Zapata said.   Zapata said the bank has not adjusted since January its projection for Guatemala's economic growth this year, which is for growth between 4.2 percent and five percent. Gross domestic product grew 3.1 percent in 1996, the lowest growth rate for the country during the 1990s and well below projections of four to five percent. Guatemala's central bank inaugurated last week a Spanish- language Web page with up-to-date macroeconomic indicators as well as historic data back through 1950. The internet address for the web page is www.banguat.gob.gt, Zapata said. ((--Fiona Ortiz, Guatemala City bureau +502 251-5718))

GCAT	German police said on Tuesday they had searched 10 apartments belonging to Algerian nationals suspected of possessing explosives in four German cities in raids coordinated with French police. A spokeswoman for the German Federal Prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said the apartments were searched because authorities suspected the Algerians of acquiring explosive materials for Algeria's rebel Armed Islamic Group (GIA) "The federal prosecutor's office is investigating Algerian nationals who are suspected of acquiring explosives for the GIA," said spokeswoman Eva Schuebel. But she said no explosive materials were found in the raid, which was closely coordinated with police in France. One person was arrested for an unrelated matter, she said. The German raids took place in Cologne, Offenbach, Frankfurt and Wiesbaden. Meanwhile, French anti-terrorist police detained 22 suspected Islamic militants in dawn raids in the Paris area, eastern France and the Riviera on Tuesday, the French interior ministry said.
CCAT	Ag-Chem Equipment Co Inc said Monday it expects a good spring season for its fertilizer application equipment, but that it is trying to control its inventories. "We had too much inventory at the end of the 1996 spring application season," said A.E. McQuinn, chief executive officer, in a news release. "We have taken a more conservative approach this year." He added that weather has cost several production days for the company and has slowed deliveries at its Minnesota manufacturing facility. "The weather, however, could have a positive effect on the year's results," he said. "Fall fertilizer application was delayed due to last year's late growing season. This was followed by heavy rain and early snowfalls. A prolonged snow melt will compress the time that fertilizer can be applied this spring. When this condition has occurred in prior years, there has been a flurry of orders in March and April if immediate delivery is available." Earlier Monday, Ag-Chem reported net income of $994,000, or $0.10 a share for the first quarter ended December 31, compared to $359 million, or $0.04 a share a year ago.

At April 28, there were 1,273 Papa John's restaurants in 39 states and the District of Columbia. The company said the acquisition gives it 353 company-owned and 920 franchises.
GCAT	German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Monday the European Union would not allow Tehran to dictate the terms of the return of EU ambassadors to Iran. All EU states except Greece recalled their ambassadors from Tehran after a German court ruled in April that Iran's top leaders had ordered the 1992 assassination of four Iranian Kurdish dissidents in a Berlin restaurant. Iran, which strongly rejected the court's conclusion, has said the envoys can return to Tehran but has indicated the German ambassador must be the last. "The German government, along with the other EU member states, is of the opinion that discrimination is out of the question when it comes to the return of the ambassadors," Kinkel said in a statement. "For this reason, a return of the EU ambassadors has not yet come about. We cannot and will not let the Iranian side dictate the conditions for this," said the minister, who also thanked Germany's European partners for their solidarity over the issue. Kinkel made clear he was in favour of a return of the envoys, although not at the price demanded by Tehran. "After a longer pause for thought, the attempt should be made to get in contact with one another again," he said.
GCAT	Up to 500 Northern Ireland police separated rival Protestant and Catholic demonstrators on Sunday to prevent any clashes during marches in the flashpoint town of Bellaghy. Police said the march passed peacefully after they formed a buffer zone and blocked rival parades. "We have no reports of any bother anywhere," a police spokesman said. Protestants of the powerful Orange Order, a civil organisation with its roots in pro-British Protestant loyalties, handed a letter of protest to a senior policeman accusing Britain of breaching their human rights. A Catholic leader told reporters that security measures were "a curfew of the nationalist people" and blamed the Protestants for parading through the overwhelmingly pro-Irish town. The Bellaghy parade was one of the first of the Protestant marching season, which police had feared could cause a re-run of last year's violence, the worst in the province for decades. Millions of pounds (dollars) of damage was caused in a showdown between members of the 60 per cent Protestant majority and 40 per cent Catholic minority whose conflicting British and Irish loyalties are the heart of the Northern Ireland conflict. The season reaches a climax in the first two weeks of July, when Protestants celebrate centuries-old battlefield victories over Catholics which entrenched a Protestant pro-British majority in what became Northern Ireland. Local Catholics in Bellaghy, which is south of the province's second city, Londonderry, had said they would hold a 12-hour counter demonstration at what they see as attempts to intimidate them by the majority pro-British community. Northern Ireland police chief Ronnie Flanagan on Sunday praised a decision by one Catholic priest to end a Saturday night service at Harryville, north of Belfast, which has been the centre of Protestant protest for more than 40 weeks. The priest, Canon Sean Connolly of Our Lady's Church, said that he would cancel the service until September, when the annual marching season ends, in the hope of defusing tension. Flanagan said: "It is a really genuine and sincere effort to reduce tension and I would like to see that regard for others being repeated." Harryville was picketed by pro-British Protestant loyalists for weeks in protest at the refusal of Catholics in the nearby village of Dunloy to allow an Orange Order parade there. The British government, churchmen and other mediators have tried in vain to get Loyalists and Catholic nationalists to negotiate a compromise over this year's marches, but Orange Order leaders refuse to hold face-to-face talks with Catholics. They believe Catholic residents are being manipulated or infiltrated by activists of Sinn Fein, the political wing of Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas fighting British rule. The main headache among security chiefs is the annual march from a small church at Drumcree through the Catholic Garvaghy Road area of Portadown, south of Belfast. Flanagan said there would be no repeat of last year's handling of the parade, which was banned until Protestant rioting forced a U-turn decision and unleashed a wave of Catholic fury in parts of the province. The Drumcree parade, which marks Northern Ireland soldiers who died for Britain in the World War One battle of the Somme, will be staged on July 6, six days before the climax of the marching season, the "Glorious Twelfth". This anniversary recalls the victories of King William of Orange over King James ll, a Catholic, in the religous wars of the late 17th century.
ECAT	Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Roger Anderson on Tuesday said that liquidity of the inflation indexed note was important and a consideration when deciding how much to sell and that he expected it to improve as more securities are issued. Speaking to reporters following remarks to a financial group, Anderson said "we hope the liquidity will improve the more securities we issue." The Tresury will sell $7.0 billion of 10-year inflation index bonds on Wednesday. "Index notes," he said "will probably never be as liquid as Treasury bills but then nothing else in the world is as liquid as Treasury bills."
GCAT	South Africa's cabinet will decide within weeks whether to challenge Egypt and arch-rival Nigeria for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said on Thursday. Pahad told Reuters South African envoys from New York, Vienna, Geneva and Addis Ababa, seat of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), had met recently to discuss the expected contest for Africa's first permanent seat on the Security Council. "We will put options to the ministers and they will have to take the final decision, but one of the options will be whether South Africa should contest the seat and the cabinet will have to decide that very soon," he said in an interview. A U.N. working group is discussing reforms including the proposed expansion of the 15-nation Security Council, of which the United States, Britain, Russia, China and France are the permanent members with the right to veto council decisions. The United States has backed the inclusion of Germany and Japan and three permanent seats for the developing world, but has not said which Third World countries should join. The OAU has called for two permanent seats for Africa alone and an additional two seats that will rotate among other countries on the continent. The existing permanent members have all said they would not tolerate any dilution of their veto powers, but have not agreed what powers the new members should have. "As part of the OAU and the Non-Aligned Movement, we support the position that there should be no differentiation between permanent members. Either the veto must go completely or all members should have the same veto powers," said Pahad. He said the OAU had asked members not to declare their interest in Security Council seats until an internal discussion was complete, but that Nigeria and Egypt had publicly announced their intention to vie for the seat. South Africa has been at loggerheads with Nigeria since President Nelson Mandela called for sanctions against military leader Sani Abacha's government after the execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other democracy campaigners in 1995. Diplomatic sources in South Africa and Zimbabwe said recently Nigeria was opposing South Africa's bid to host the Olympic Games in 2004. "There is a very strong feeling in international circles that if there are one or two seats for Africa, South Africa should contest," Pahad said. "But we have to look at the implications in terms of human resources, financial implications and general responsibility. The cabinet will have to decide whether we are willing to take on these very significant obligations." Pahad, who is generally far more visible than elderly Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, said a permanent seat would commit South Africa to greater financial and manpower contributions and could involve greater involvement in peace-keeping operations. "Of course, being a permanent member of the Security Council also means you're in the big league and advantages come with that in terms of interacting with the major powers on issues of international importance and the ability to influence, if necessary, important decisions," he said.
CCAT	The Netherlands' national airport at Schiphol could be moved to a man-made island in the North Sea, a report by the Dutch national resources and demographics institute(RPD) said on Friday. It added that an artificial island is the most logical location for a new national airport. The report was prepared for the Dutch planning ministry. The RPD said moving Schiphol would avoid the need for a second national airport. The report is intended as an advisory document ahead of a review of airport capacity due in to start in March next year. The proposal is one way of achieving improved long term growth for the airport and of reducing environmental objections to further expansion of the existing airport, it added. The report also examined a number of other options including boosting current capacity at Schiphol, the construction of a satellite airport and a third option, of building a second national airport offshore. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017
GCAT	A search resumed on Sunday for 28 seamen lost in a remote part of the South Atlantic after their ship sank while carrying sugar from Brazil to Iraq. A Hercules C-130 plane was flying to the area for the third day to look for survivors or wreckage from the Jahan, which went down on Friday about 680 miles west of Cape Town. South African airforce spokeswoman Marietta Hopley said hopes were fading that the crew would be found alive, even though weather in the area was fine. "Up till now no radio contact, beacon signals or flares have been received or seen by the Hercules search crew," she said in a statement. The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Australia picked up a distress call on Thursday night saying the freighter was flooding and the crew were abandoning ship. The centre said the Jahan went down five hours later. There was no word on what caused the sinking of the 15,022 deadweight tonne Jahan, built in 1972, registered in Belize and operated by Seatimes Shipping of Singapore. The weather in the region, midway between the South African coast and the remote island of Tristan da Cunha, was reported to be fine at the time. A spokesman for Seatimes in Singapore said the Jahan, owned by Jahan Shipping of Panama, was on charter to a London company and carrying 14,000 tonnes of sugar from Brazil to Iraq.
MCAT	Most Polish shares fell in higher turnover on Friday but gains by a few heavyweights pushed the main index up and analysts said further gains were possible on Monday following continuous trade rises. The main market's WIG index rose 94.8 points, or 0.6 percent, to 16,376.9, and turnover rose 19 percent to 172 million zlotys ($55.5 million) on all three markets as 51 issues fell, 28 rose and 13 were flat. Analysts said, however, any strong gains were unlikely as the bourse was in a horizontal trend with investor interest shifting to several attractive primary market offerings. "I think there might be growth (on Monday), as most stocks traded higher in the continuous trade than at fixing, but I think generally we have consolidation phase," said Ryszard Sikora, an analyst at Bank Slaski brokerage. Analysts said companies earnings reports for March, most of them due later on Friday could influence individual stock performance, but said their impact on the market as a whole was very limited. On Monday Kredyt Bank starts its 83-million zloty ($26.8 million) offering and metals trader Impexmetal SA starts initial public offering estimated at 222 million zlotys ($71.6 million). Analysts also said Thursday and Friday sessions, which did not follow Dow Jones previous day's performance, signalled that recent Polish speculator's trend to imitate Wall Street's daily movements could end. In the continuous trade eight stocks rose and eight were flat with the WIG 20 index close at 1,635.7 points, one percent higher than at the regular session.
CCAT	Gottschalks Inc said it is in discussions with another retail company to form a strategic alliance that could lead to an increase in its department-store base by between 20 percent and 30 percent.

MCAT	U.S. West Coast light crude prices fell Thursday, amid little activity and lower benchmark American grades, traders said. Chevron, oversupplied with imports, sold a 400,000 to 475,000 barrel cargo of Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude to Texaco at $1.37 off June West Texas Intermediate (WTI), traders said Wednesday. Delivery dates in June and the exact volume of ANS shipped have yet to be determined, traders said.   The new discount falls five cents a barrel under the last ANS deal, done April 11 at $1.32 Crude oil for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) fell 30 cents a barrel Thursday to $19.91, on technical selling. Outright prices for ANS crude dropped 30 cents $18.43/18.63 a barrel. On a notional basis, Line 63 was talked 95 cents a gallon under ANS, or $2.37/2.27 under May West Texas Intermediate/Cushing (WTI). The grade rarely trades off WTI. Traders reported no deals in Line 63 and heavy California grades. --David Brinkerhoff, Los Angeles bureau, +1 213 380 2014
ECAT	Hungary's finance minister said that in 1998 Hungary will maintain overall public spending at current levels in real terms, with above-inflation increases for public investment and agricultural subsidies. "Preserving the real value of (government) expenditure is a realistic target but in two areas -- public investment and agricultural subsidies -- spending should rise at a larger pace than inflation," Peter Medgyessy told the Hungarian daily Nepszava in an interview published on Saturday. He said public investment could rise by as much as 12 percent in real terms while agricultural subsidies would rise by inflation plus the equivalent of 1998 GDP growth -- which the government currently forecasts at four to five percent, after a two to three percent rise in 1997. Medgyessy said no overall real increase in the central budget will be necessary to cover extra spending in the chosen sectors. "These two items account for 10 percent of the whole government budget which means that from the remaining 90 percent it is easy to redirect funds to cover the increases," he said, adding that government spending on education would be maintained. He said the increase in public investments, including infrastructure, would result in subsequent savings to the central budget. "If we manage to raise public investments by 10 to 12 percent in real terms it will bring in 30 billion forints worth of surplus financing," he said. Regarding inflation policy, Medgyessy said the government was likely to adopt the less harsh of two alternative strategies he will put to the cabinet within the next couple of weeks. One of the scenarios envisages year-on-year price growth falling below 10 percent by December 1998 from current levels of around 19 percent, while the alternative proposal would see an end-1998 inflation figure of up to three percentage points higher. Medgyessy, who earlier this week told Reuters he saw end-1997 year-on-year inflation as low as 16 to 17 percent, told the Nepszava that a "strained reduction" to 10 percent by the following year could inhibit GDP growth. He said the less radical inflation cut programme was likely to be better for the economy as a whole. "I think there is a larger chance that an average yearly reduction of four to five percentage points can be sustained," he said. Medgyessy also said he was against any softening of fiscal policy ahead of elections due in spring 1998. "I have a principle according to which only those governments which do not have confidence in themselves make (tax) concessions ahead of elections." Medgyessy also said he would stand down as finance minister after the elections, whatever the result. "My aim is to lead the ministry until the elections and I have already said that after 1998 I do not wish to continue to play a political role." "Two of my main targets have been reached: the balance of the economy has improved further and signs of economic growth can already be seen," he said. He also described the recent government approval of the pension reform plan as a breakthrough. "I would have resigned if the plan had not been approved." The drastic overhaul of Hungary's pension system was passed by the cabinet at the end of last month and is due to go before parliament shortly. Under the plan, Hungary would retain parts of its antiquated pay-as-you-go system and would also add modern fully funded components. -- Budapest newsroom +361 327 3030

MCAT	CBOT soyoil futures ended firmer but off the day's highs as funds bought at least 2,000 lots, traders said. Soymeal futures closed mixed with nearbys down on fund long liquidation ahead of first notice day Friday. "We just crushed the March/May spread," one trader said, referring to soymeal. "Funds were getting out of the March." Traders said they did not expect any deliveries to be posted against the March soymeal contract but soyoil deliveries were expected to be heavy. Floor sources estimated at least 2,000 lots would be posted for delivery Friday. "The cash basis is 1.50 (cent per lb) under the March. Why wouldn't you deliver?" one floor source said. Meanwhile, cash soymeal prices remained strong with prices at Decatur, Ill., quoted at $7 over March futures on Thursday, cash sources said. On the day, Smith Barney and Rosenthal Collins each bought 800 lots May soyoil and E.D. and F. Man International bought 600 lots May, traders said.

MCAT	Jakarta share prices ended higher on Friday following a late spurt of buying in selected big-capitalised stocks, brokers said. The Jakarta Composite index rose 8.09 points, or 1.27 percent, to close at 646.19 points. Advancers led decliners by 56 to 33, while 65 counters remained unchanged. "We had initially expected the market to remain slow, but a spurt of fresh big-cap buying in late trading boosted sentiment and prompted further buying in small-caps," one broker said.   Heavyweight Barito Pacific topped the active list as it rose 75 rupiah to close at 1,550 rupiah, with some 6.8 million shares changing hands. Brokers attributed the rise to news reports on Thursday that Indonesia's export earnings from the forestry sector rose to $8.3 billion in 1996 from $7.1 billion in 1995. Another heavyweight, Telkom, ended 125 rupiah higher at 4,225 rupiah in active trading following the government's decision to revise local telephone tariffs.   The government announced on Monday it planned to raise tariffs for local telephone calls and lower the cost of regional and international calls from January 1. Secondliners property firm Summarecon and travel firm Bayu Buana were among the most actively traded due to speculative reasons, brokers said. Summarecon rose 75 rupiah to 975 rupiah on continued talk of a possible acquisition and that it may soon touch 1,000 rupiah. Bayu Buana rose 100 rupiah to 825 rupiah on market talk that the travel firm may touch 900 rupiah in the coming days as it was still considered undervalued, another broker said.   Gainers included Gudang Garam, Astra Internasional and Indosat. Losers included Sampoerna, Bank Niaga and Polysindo. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
MCAT	Tokyo rubber futures ended higher on Monday, helped by the yen's weaker tendency against the dollar, traders said. Prices ranged from 0.4 yen to 1.7 yen per kg higher. Benchmark August was up 0.9 yen at 156.0 yen. Activity was thin as private investors were tending to put money into more volatile commodity futures such as grain, after closing positions in rubber futures. The market opened firmer on short-covering. "The market was basically directionless. Weak physical demand in producing countries may put a lid on prices," one trader said.

CCAT	Telecommunication vendors said on Wednesday compatibility in global digital wireless systems would protect existing investments and keep consumer costs down. Officials from four major U.S. and Canadian phone makers -- Lucent Technologies, Motorola, Northern Telecom (Nortel) and Qualcomm Inc -- said they would jointly promote a new standard digital format with that in mind. They announced joint efforts to develop specifications for next generation wireless communications standards at a CDMA congress in Singapore "If you really want to move toward a global standard and gain acceptance, you can't ignore existing investments people have made," said Anthony Hennen, Motorola senior vice president and general manager (cellular infrastructure products group). The new third generation digital system using wider-band Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology aims to be more widely used than current systems, he said. The companies hoped to see a convergence in global systems, including compatibility with a new competing standard in Japan. "We have to work together to provide a single standard instead of varying standards that drive down volume," said John Major, executive vice president at QUALCOMM. The proposed new standards using existing CDMA technology would meet or exceed the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) requirements for high speed data transport to a single subscriber, company officials said. These requirements include wireless data rates of 144 kilobits per second (kbps) at mobile speeds, 384 kbps at pedestrian speeds and two megabits per second while stationary. The more advanced CDMA system will improve voice quality by reducing static and allow for higher subscriber capacity. Cellular phones in the United States are mostly on CDMA technology, while other countries are using a variety of systems such as the global system for mobile communications (GSM). "We've seen some major announcements coming out of Japan for CDMA. They have selected the technology over GSM, to be implemented in their market in 1998," said Perry LaForge, executive director of the CDMA Development Group. He said China was conducting trials with commericial orders already in place, and markets in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan were seeing better subscriber growth. The CDMA technology is expected to be available in Singapore within the next few months, he said. LaForge said CDMA technology aided costs savings by reducing the number of base stations required to transmit signals. Fewer base stations lower infrastructural costs, real estate investment and removes the need for laying cables, he said.
MCAT	Nov 19 - U.S. stock index futures closed higher and near new all-time highs set late in the session in S&P 500 and Value Line index futures. Strength in cash stocks, which also rose to new highs late, linked in part to firm bonds, fueled the late rise in index futures, traders said. They also noted some index arb activity in S&Ps as premiums widened on the rise. -Derivatives Desk(312)408-8750/E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com   Premiums widened on the afternoon advance in index futures, with at least three light arbitrage buy programs triggered in the December S&P 500 contract when the premium over the spot index widened over 3.40 to 3.60 points, traders said. Futures had slipped in early afternoon dealings when the bond market fell on the weak auction results, traders noted. However, the S&P 500 contract managed to stay above technical support which they pegged at about 737.00 in the Decmeber contract.
ECAT	Monday is the deadline for payment of back taxes on thousands of properties in Philadelphia, ahead of a key vote this week on a plan to sell the city's outstanding tax liens. As part of a plan to securitize the liens, Philadelphia officials have stepped up collection efforts. Hundreds of residents have paid back property taxes or made payment arrangements, under the threat that the city would sell the outstanding liens to more aggressive private collection agencies. Although a vote is scheduled for later this week, it remains unclear whether enough city council members support the tax lien sale. Several have expressed concern that the collection agencies would force poor residents out of their homes. Pressure to pass the tax lien legislation is expected from Mayor Ed Rendell because the revenue is needed for both the city and the Philadelphia School District. --U.S. Municipal Desk, 212-859-1650
CCAT	Creditor banks have extended emergency loans to two unlisted affiliates of South Korea's Jinro Group, an official at SEOULBANK said on Monday. The bank official said creditors granted Jinro Mass-Merchandising Inc 32.3 billion won and Jinro Construction 13.7 billion won on Saturday.   "The amount was same as the bail-out committee by financial institutions had decided," said the official. South Korean banks agreed on April 28 to provide 80.4 billion won in emergency loans to the troubled Jinro Group. But group chairman Chang Jin-ho was required to give banks authority to dispose of his family's shares of group units. So far, only those two companies have given a letter to their primary lenders authorising family share disposal. Creditors had different loan conditions. For example, the annual interest rate on loans extended by SEOULBANK was set at the bank's prime rate of 8.75 percent plus four percent. The loans would expire on July 27, as decided by the bail-out committee. -- Seoul Newsroom (822) 727 5647
GCAT	A century by captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul frustrated the Indian bowlers after they had made a mess of Guyana's upper order batsman during the second day of their four-day match on Saturday. Guyana had been reduced to 95 for five when the West Indies test batsman came in. An unbeaten 103 by Chanderpaul allowed Guyana to reach 214 for six at the close in reply to India's first innings total of 341 all out. Chanderpaul and Vishal Nagamootoo, who was not out 20 at the close, added 83 runs in an unbeaten seventh wicket partnership. Dodanarsiah Ganesh was the pick of the Indian bowlers with three for 46 off 15 overs. Earlier, India, resuming at 294 for five overnight had, not for the first time during their tour, collapsed after appearing to be in a dominant position, losing their last five wickets for only 47 runs. Paceman Reon King, who took three wickets on Friday, was the scourge of the Indian batsman, taking a further four to finish with figures of seven for 82.
CCAT	Vietnamese wheat and wheat flour consumption is expected to reach 500,000 tonnes by 2000 from around 400,000 tonnes in 1997, the deputy director-general of the Vietnam Southern Food Corporation said on Friday. Cao Thi Ngoc Hoa told a wheat conference in Singapore that demand for wheat and wheat flour had risen steadily from 100,000 tonnes in 1980 to 320,000 tonnes in 1995. "We expect it will be 500,000 tonnes for the year 2000. We need to import all the wheat from other countries," she said.   Some 150,000 tonnes of wheat is imported annually, mainly from Australia. The rest is wheat flour and comes from France, India and China, Cao said. About 60 percent of all imports is used for noodles and the rest is for items like cakes and bread. Cao said three flour mills were being constructed in Vietnam and should be completed in three years. -- Singapore Newsroom (65-8703305)
GCAT	Fewer Albanian protesters are marching each day in this southern town but demonstrators and local opposition leaders said they would press on despite fearing a police crackdown was imminent. Some 400 protesters marched along the destitute town's main street chanting "Down with the government" in a sixth day of demonstrations sparked by the collapse of dubious pyramid investment schemes. Security forces continued to keep a low profile. Some 40 uniformed policemen watched from the sidewalks, led by the town's police chief clad in a white trench coat. But locals said many civilians loitering on the streets were secret policemen or employed by the ruling Democratic Party, the focus of protesters' outrage after the collapse of investment funds. One middle-aged man wearing a black jacket was overheard to mutter to a bystander: "Why don't they give us the orders." State television showed pictures of the local leader of the key opposition Socialist, Petro Koci, as protesters carried him on their shoulders during Sunday's march. Authorities accused him of inciting the marches. "There is a lot of pressure on us," Koci told Reuters in an interview at his party headquarters. "We receive threatening phone calls by criminals who are supported by the Democrats." "We have to be very careful, especially in the evening it is difficult to go out. Sometimes (at night) we do not stay at our homes," he added. Assurances by local security forces that they would let protesters go ahead while calling on them to remain peaceful did little to quell widespread fear of imminent police action. "There is serious tension in this town, not only because of the police but because of some special groups organised by the Democratic Party. People are afraid of them," Koci said. "The presence of foreign media is a very important factor in preventing police violence. They are afraid of witnesses," he added. Protesters regularly cheer assembled foreign camera teams, waving into their lenses and pleading with them to broadcast their plight around the world. The 36-year-old Koci was arrested last month and detained for three days after an angry crowd set fire to the local town hall. He said he had been summoned to see the Fier police chief again on Monday but had declined the invitation. The local chairman of the country's ruling Democrats told Reuters last week his party had organised "special groups" to protect the protesters from "violent extremists". But demonstrators said threats were not enough to quell the month-long popular unrest which has posed the most serious challenge to President Sali Berisha's rule since he came to power five years ago. "We are determined to go all the way," said Agron, a man in his mid-twenties. "We won't give up before this government resigns."
CCAT	Suzuki Motor Corp said on Friday it will take a 11.6 percent stake in a Chinese automaker to be set up next month. Suzuki will buy a stake in Chongqing Changan Automobile, which will be formed in mid-October by spinning off Changan Automobile Co Ltd's automobile division. Changan produces Suzuki-designed mini cars and commercial vehicles under Suzuki's technical assistance. The automaker is located in Chongqing, Sichuan province.
CCAT	Indonesia's state oil company Pertamina said on Wednesday domestic fuel consumption rose six percent in the 1996/97 (April-March) fiscal year. "Total national fuel consumption was 47.5 million kilolitres in 1996/97. It rose six percent from 1995/96," Pertamina said in a statement. It gave no other details. Pertamina said it estimated domestic fuel consumption would reach 50.9 million kilolitres in fiscal 1997/98. It said it would import about 10 million kilolitres of fuel products in 1997/98. Pertamina has eight refineries with a combined capacity of 989,500 barrels per day.
GCAT	The new Taleban Islamic movement government in Afghanistan said on Sunday no Islamic funeral service could be held for executed former president Najibullah. An announcement on the official Kabul Radio, monitored in Islamabad, said a "Namaz-i-Janaza (funeral prayer service) for Najibullah cannot be held because he was a communist and murderer of innocent Afghans". The Taleban militia executed Najibullah, his brother and two other aides on Friday immediately after capturing Kabul from the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. The four men were dragged from a United Nations compound where they had sheltered under U.N. protection since Najibullah was ousted in a palace coup in April 1992. Islamic mujahideen guerrillas subsequently took power from the collapsed former communist government after 14 years of civil war. The bloodied bodies of Najibullah and Shahpur were hanged from a concrete traffic post outside the presidential palace in Kabul for two days before being delivered anonymously to a hospital. The new government has not yet said what is to be done with the remains of the two men. Officials of the International committee of the Red Cross in Kabul said on Sunday Najibullah's family had contacted them. "We hope for a humanitarian solution," one official said. A large Islamic funeral prayer meeting for Najibullah was held on Saturday in the southwestern Pakistani town of Quetta, where speakers condemned his execution.

MCAT	British gilts stole a march on Australian bonds to offer the best returns in the week to June 5 in the Salomon Brothers world government bond index (WGBI), Salomon's said on Friday. Gilts offered returns of 0.80 percent and Australian bonds 0.79 percent in local currency terms. These were closely followed by French bonds which rallied early in the week unconcerned by the unexpected success of the Socialist Party in the French election on Sunday. OATs made gains of 0.75 percent in French franc terms. The total WGBI showed gains of 0.63 percent in a week where the benefits of a surprise interest rate cut in Australia on May 23, filtered through to the bond market. In Europe politics cast a shadow of doubt over the future of the European single currency, dampening enthusiasm for continental European government debt but shoring up U.S. Treasuries ahead of the key U.S. payrolls numbers later in the session. German Bunds, Italian BTPs and Spanish bonos all made investors gains of 0.64 percent in local currency terms, offering the same returns as U.S. Treasuries. The only losers this week were Swiss bonds, which showed a loss of 0.12 percent in local currency terms. Japanese government bonds brought returns of 0.56 percent in yen terms. But in U.S. dollar terms JGBs made the second highest gains of the week at 0.90 percent, just behind Canadian bonds returns of 0.94 percent. Salomon's bond index is calculated using all government bonds with over one year to maturity, weighted for market capitalisation. Only bonds freely available to institutional investors and with a certain minimum amount outstanding are included. Returns take account of price moves and accrued interest. --International bonds unit + 44 171 542 4041

GCAT	A Chilean human rights panel has uncovered a further 899 cases of people who died or disappeared during General Augusto Pinochet's rule, bringing the total to nearly 3,200, officials said on Thursday. The report was the final step in a six-year investigation into political repression under the military regime which ruled Chile with an iron grip from 1973 to 1990. "The most serious result of the deep and painful conflicts experienced by Chilean society in recent years was...human rights violations," said board president Alejandro Poblete who presented the report to President Eduardo Frei. The Reconciliation and Compensation Corporation said the new cases were in addition to the 2,298 victims named in an official 1990 investigation into human rights violations during Pinochet's government. The new figures bring the number of victims of political repression to 3,197, of whom 2,095 are known to have died and 1,102 are officially classified as "disappeared" -- meaning no trace of them has been found since they were abducted. Investigations into human rights violations have been a frequent source of friction between the country's civilian authorities and the powerful armed forces since Chile returned to democracy in 1990. Despite ceding power to civilians that year, Pinochet remains commander-in-chief of the army. Interior Minster Carlos Figueroa said the government was looking into setting up a permanent body to defend human rights and would set up a special unit to take up the search for the bodies of people who have disappeared. "The families of human rights violation victims can be reassured that they will continue to be helped in their search for the truth about their loved ones," said Figueroa. Most victims were left-wing opponents of Pinochet, many of whom were killed and tortured by the regime's feared security services. An amnesty law dictated by the armed forces in 1978 has meant that few cases have been tried with only a handful of military officers behind bars for human rights crimes. Pinochet, now 80, came to power in a bloody coup in September 1973 which overthrew Marxist President Salvador Allende. The lower house of Congress last week voted to create a national holiday, Day of the Disappeared and Detained People, to be celebrated on August 30 to commemorate those who died during the Pinochet years. The bill's fate will be decided in the Senate, where majority pro-military rightists have said they oppose it.

GCAT	The Czech opposition Social Democrats (CSSD), for the second consecutive day, have placed higher in a public opinion poll than the centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS) of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The survey of 1,578 Czechs in May by the private STEM agency released on Thursday put the CSSD on 28.1 percent, its highest poll showing ever, while the ODS was on 20.4 percent, its poorest result ever. The results of the survey come after a similar poll by the state-funded IVVM agency on Wednesday had the CSSD on 25 percent and Klaus's ODS on 18 percent. The three-party governing coalition, however, would still garner 43.8 percent of the vote if an election was held in early May, which would give it 101 of the 200 seats under the proportional seat system used in the lower house of parliament, STEM said. The coalition only won 99 seats in last June elections, but has since regained a majority through opposition defections. Coalition partners, the centrist Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL) and the liberal Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) recorded a 12.0 and 11.4 percent support respectively. The combined opposition, including the Social Democrats, unreformed Communists and far-right Republicans, would get 42.7 percent of the vote. The two surveys are the first since the government announced a package of pro-growth measures on April 16 to help stimulate the economy and ease pressures brought about by a growing trade deficit. General elections are not due until mid-2000, but many analysts have said the government would probably fall before then. -- Jan Lopatka, Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003
ECAT	Ireland's adjusted annual private sector credit growth rose to 19 percent in April from 18.6 percent the previous month, the central bank said on Thursday.   The adjusted rate of growth of the broad money supply, M3E, rose to 17.3 percent from 16.2 percent. "The money and credit developments in April occurred against the background of foreign exchange market developments during the month which are likely to have added to credit growth," the central bank said in a statement. It said non-mortgage Irish-pound credit was 22 percent higher at end-April than a year earlier, compared with a 20.7 percent increase in the year to March. The annual rate of increase in residential mortgage lending remained unchanged at 14.3 percent.   Central bank monthly statistics showed private sector credit rose by 961 million Irish pounds or 2.6 percent. Around one third of the increase was due to lending to companies in Dublin's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). Of the remainder, 518 million was in Irish pounds and 138 million was foreign-currency denominated. Mortgage lending accounted for 175 million of the increase in Irish-pound credit in April. Short-term notes and bills, and term and revolving loans each contributed around 130 million. -- Dublin Newsroom +353 1 676 9779

ECAT	A last ditch measure proposed by the IMF to save Bulgaria's crumbling economy is not a panacea and is seen by some as a risky experiment which will not compensate for sluggish reform, analysts said on Friday. Senior IMF officials are talking to Bulgarian officials, politicians and bankers about introducing a currency board to stabilise the country's economy by curbing inflation and restoring confidence in the lev currency. Under the currency board system, the amount of national currency in circulation must be exactly matched by the central bank's hard currency reserves. Currency boards, pegging the local currency usually to the dollar, have been used by Argentina, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia to restore confidence and help defeat hyperinflation. "The most important element of overall stabilisation is that a currency board must be supported by reforms in the real economy, in the financial system and in legislation," economist Mariella Nenova said. A finance ministry official who declined to be named said, "It is illusionary to believe that the currency board alone would resolve all problems. Besides, adopting such a system, which would have to last for around three years at least, is a serious responsibility to future generations." He said none of the countries with currency board systems have had Bulgaria's huge domestic debt problem. Neither the IMF nor the cabinet has so far come up with solutions for the country's 600 billion levs ($2.4 billion) domestic debt. The rate at which the lev would be pegged had not been discussed yet, the central bank said. Dealers said it would be logical to peg the lev to the mark as Germany is Bulgaria's biggest investor and trade partner, but there is a strong perception of the dollar as a benchmark of stability and most people convert savings into dollars. The Deputy Director of the IMF European Department, Michael Deppler, said that delays to reforms by Bulgaria's six governments since 1989 have produced much bigger and deeper problems than the Fund or the government had expected. The IMF has said it would support a currency board plan, which would take up to three months to implement, but has not said by how much. Finance Minister Dimitar Kostov said the amount of levs in circulation, including commercial banks' minimum reserve deposits in the central bank totalling 169 billion levs, would have to be matched with foreign exchange reserves. BNB forex reserves stood at $541 million at the end of October and the country would also have to collateralise its gold, said Kostov. He did not say whether all of the country's gold would be collateralised or only some 4.5 tonnes kept in banks abroad. Bulgaria's strategic gold reserves held in the central bank total some 33 tonnes, or about 1.5 million troy ounces. Fixing the lev would also curb speculation on the local interbank forex market, which has existed since February 1991 when the lev became internally convertible, dealers said. Bulgaria's alternative is to continue its current high interest rate monetary restriction policy, but this would keep inflation high, Kostov said on Thursday. Bulgaia's monthly consumer price inflation was 16.7 percent in October. He said a currency board was the less risky of the two and a political consensus was needed on which option to choose. The IMF has twice postponed a $115 million loan due to Bulgaria's failure to meet reform targets which include curbing inflation, stabilising the exchange rate, speeding up privatisation and closing loss-making enterprises. Bulgaria has overshot all of its budget targets for this year and has postponed drafting the 1997 budget until the end of December due to unpredictability of the interest rate, currently 180 percent.

GCAT	Chief U.N. arms inspector Rolf Ekeus called Wednesday for a firm reaction by the Security Council to what he said was Iraq's repeated blocking of U.N. weapons teams. Speaking to reporters after briefing the council on a recent series of incidents, he said Iraq's actions were "a clear violation" of council resolutions. "If Iraq is allowed now to decide what we should inspect, when we should inspect it, I think the value of the whole mechanism set up after the Gulf war would be put into question," he said, referring to the U.N. special commission (UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction and ensuring they are not replaced. "This a challenge to the whole ceasefire arrangement and a challenge to the United Nations, which was given the task by the (Gulf war) coalition to carry out the ceasefire. So I said that we expect a firm reaction from the Security Council to support the activities of the commission and by the IAEA (the International Atomic Energy Agency)," he added. Council sources said some members were working on a draft resolution dealing with the recent incidents, which included blocking U.N. weapons teams from three sites they wished to search last week. The sources said a strong resolution was likely to be opposed by Russia, China and Egypt, which in the past have been more sympathetic to Iraq. American U.N. envoy Bill Richardson, who is pressing for a tough resolution, told reporters Iraq had been guilty of "a pattern of concealment, of deception, of delays, of destruction of documents." "What we have is a situation where Saddam Hussein's regime refuses to cooperate with the U.N. Security Council and UNSCOM," he said, urging "an appropriately strong response." Though Richardson did not say so, if the council found Iraq had committed a "material breach" of the Gulf war ceasefire, the way would be cleared for the United States, if it wished, to launch air raids or cruise missile strikes against Iraqi targets, as it has done on several previous occasions. But it seemed doubtful that a resolution containing such language would receive unanimous support. Last Friday the council issued a relatively mild statement deploring an earlier series of incidents in which UNSCOM said Iraqi personnel aboard U.N. helicopters, or Iraqi helicopters flying nearby, had endangered the U.N. craft and their crews assisting U.N. ground teams. Ekeus said that when U.N. inspectors visited a university where professors were known to have been involved in a biological weapons program, one of them tried to escape with a batch of papers. He was intercepted and the documents were found to relate to "very sensitive development and production efforts concerning a major biological warfare agent, which was not declared before by Iraq. So we will have to investigate that further." Ekeus, who will leave UNSCOM July 1 and will be succeeded by Australian U.N. envoy Richard Butler, speculated that it "may be because we are changing leadership of the special commission that Iraq is now trying to change the ground rules somewhat." Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, in a recent letter to the Security Council, said access to some sites had recently been denied because of concern that the inspections were not to carry out UNSCOM's mandate but to "detect the arrangements made for the security of Iraq, its leadership and the personnel involved." This concern was heightened "by the fact that many of those who carry out inspection team missions are United States nationals, seconded to work with the special commission." Aziz said the UNSCOM team concerned had been allowed to inspect 40 out of the 43 sites to which it sought access. Denial of access to the other sites "cannot be interpreted as a decision by the government of Iraq to prevent the special commission implementing its mandate, as Mr Ekeus alleges," he added.
MCAT	The Russian Trading System 24-share index surged seven percent to a record 247.69 on record trading volume for the whole market of $58.23 million on Friday, the NAUFOR brokers association said.   Many leading shares recorded double-digit percentage gains in a highly volatile market as foreign investors poured money into Russia despite President Boris Yeltsin's latest health problems, dealers said. Utility Mosenergo ended at $1.41, off an intrasession high of $1.53 but well up on Thursday's closing $1.26. Utility Irkutskenergo rose to $0.195 from Thursday's $0.170. It leapt to $0.220 during the afternoon after confirming it planned to issue American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) this month. Oil company Surgutneftegaz, which will launch its ADRs on Monday, rose to $0.615 from $0.575, off a high of $0.635. Companies which have issued ADRs, which allow foreign investors to buy shares while avoiding domestic settlement problems, have tended to outperform the market. LUKoil rose to $14.25 from $13.10.   Dealers said there were signs of a correction towards the end of trading, although it was unclear whether this would continue next week. "There's a correction on the market. Let's see what happens on Monday," said United City Bank dealer Dmitry Yevenko. "If there's an inflow of new funds, prices will rise again," he said, attributing today's gains to position-building by western operators already here anticipating fresh money. Creditanstalt-Grant dealer Andrei Galperin said the launch of Surgutneftegaz's ADRs on Monday could fuel a new rise. Other dealers attributed Friday's rise to new money from western investors as well as position-covering by locals. Alfa-Kapital dealer Mikhail Khaleyev noted the gains were concentrated in the most liquid "blue chip" stocks, while second tier shares had risen much less. "This was probably because it was new investors, who mainly take traditional stocks," he said. --Olga Popova, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
ECAT	Total direct foreign investment in Romania since the 1989 end of communism rose to $2.2 billion at the end of 1996 from $1.6 billion the previous year, the Romanian Development Agency (ARD) said on Monday. It said the $608.4 million in foreign investment last year came from contributions of capital to newly created joint ventures, increases of capital of existing companies and investment in privatised companies. The largest single foreign investor in Romania is South Korea's Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd, which last year put $53 million into a Romanian Black Sea shipyard, raising its investment in the Balkan country to $200 million. The South Korean company had previously bought a 51 percent stake in a local car marker, which it plans to expand further before the year 2000 on $1.0 billion investment. Romania hopes foreign investment, now at a paltry level compared with other East European countries, to pick up this year as the new centrist government pledged to support foreign investors by boosting facilities, including tax cuts and foreign ownership of land. Local economists say in order to attract foreign investors cash-strapped Romania will have to speed up restructuring and privatisation, secure a smooth run of the foreign exchange and capital markets and work out of a separate law on portfolio investment. Local media recently said a group of around 20 U.S. and British companies were expected in Romania early in February to look into investment opportunities in chemistry, the heavy and machine-building industries and in the capital market. Envisaged investment by those companies was $10 billion. -- Luli Popescu, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264
ECAT	New orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly during July, the Commerce Department said Friday, with widespread gains across most major categories. Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $317.6 billion, significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists. That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders. Shipments of finished products and order backlogs also increased from June, suggesting firm underlying strength in the economy's industrial sector as the second half began. Orders for costly durable goods like new cars, refrigerators and other items intended to last three years or more rose a revised 1.7 percent in July to $172.9 billion after a 0.2 percent fall in June. Previously the department said June factory orders had fallen more sharply, by 0.9 percent, but it revised that to a 0.7 percent decline. Strong July factory orders reinforced other signs that the economy entered the final six months of the year with considerable momentum. In a separate report, the department said consumer spending barely edged up in July, as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months. Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June. Incomes from wages, salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June. The department had previously reported a 1.6 percent rise in July durables orders, but it revised that up slightly. Orders for non-durables like food and paper products --items that are used up more quickly -- also picked up strongly in July, by 1.8 percent to $144.7 billion following a 1.2 percent decrease in June. Among durable products, the only category that showed a decline in July from June was transportation equipment, down 0.4 percent to $41.6 billion after a 1.3 percent June drop. But that was mainly because of a falloff in demand for military ships and tanks that offset a pickup in orders for new cars. Shipments of motor vehicles and parts grew by 5.4 percent in July after a 1.2 percent fall in June. In the automobile industry, shipments correspond to orders. Excluding transportation, factory orders were up 2.1 percent in July after easing in June by 0.6 percent. The biggest increase in July came in orders for electrical and electronic equipment, up 4.7 percent to $28 billion after a 3.8 percent June increase. Industrial machinery orders gained 2.9 percent to $32.6 billion following a 0.3 percent June rise. Total shipments of manufactured goods, which reflect more immediate demand than orders, increased by 1.2 percent in July to $312.7 billion after a 0.8 percent fall in June. Unfilled orders increased by 1 percent to $504.1 billion after a 0.7 percent June increase. It was the tenth increase in order backlogs in the past 11 months, indicating likely strength in manufacturing industries in coming months. Orders for non-defence capital goods, a measure of business' expansion plans, rose 0.6 percent in July after falling 0.1 percent in June. Excluding aircraft, non-defence capital goods were up by 1 percent last month after a 1 percent June drop.
MCAT	The key June 10-year Japanese government bond futures contract ended slightly higher on Monday due to short-covering by dealers, traders said. "Traders showed little inclination to trade actively today," said a trader for a city bank's securities unit. The June rose slightly on short-covering by dealers prompted by the firmness of cash JGBs and also by the need for position adjustment, the trader said. The June ended at 126.91, up slightly from Friday's close of 126.85. Turnover was 17,862 contracts.   Traders said the market would be focusing on a 10-year JGB auction scheduled on Tuesday, and the possible launch of a straight bond by Tokyo Electric Power Co Inc (TEPCO) later this week. Traders said the coupon rate of the new issue of 10-year JGBs was likely to be set at a record low of 2.3 percent. There may be solid demand from investors despite the low coupon rate if the new issues are offered at under par, traders said. TEPCO is likely to launch about 150 billion yen to 200 billion yen worth of 10-year straight bonds, traders said.   The transition to a "T-plus-three" rolling settlement system, in which JGB transactions are settled three business days after the trade date, may be contributing somewhat to the firmness of cash JGBs, traders said. T-plus-three settlement went into effect starting with JGBs traded on Monday. JGB transactions were previously settled seven days after the trade date. The shorter settlement period may be making dealers reluctant to sell cash JGBs short and may be encouraging buy-backs of cash JGBs, the trader for a city bank's securities unit said.   The benchmark 182nd JGB yield stood at 2.145 percent as of 0648 GMT, down slightly from Friday's close of 2.155 percent. Comments by Bank of Japan governor Yasuo Matsushita during a speech opening a two-day meeting of BOJ branch managers on Monday were in line with his previous statements and had little effect on the market, traders said. Matushita said a temporary slowdown of the economy was inevitable due to the effects of fiscal tightening measures. But Matsushita said that, taking into account positive signs in production, incomes and spending, it was highly likely that the economic recovery would continue after this setback.   Taking into account such conditions in the economy, it was appropriate for the BOJ to maintain its present monetary policy, Matsushita said. "We will continue to carry out monetary policy putting emphasis on strengthening the basis for the economic recovery," he said. --Masayuki Kitano, Tokyo Treasury Desk +81-3-5473-3748
CCAT	Norwegian pharmaceuticals group Nycomed ASA said on Wednesday restructuring costs and price pressure on a key product helped slash 1996 net profits. Net profits shrank to 104 million crowns from 1.16 billion in 1995. But the company, reaffirming plans unveiled last year, said it expected to make savings of 600 million crowns per year before tax with full effect from 1998. Nycomed A and B shares were up in early trade on the Oslo Bourse following the release of the results.   Pre-tax profits excluding restructuring costs in 1996 were 1.17 billion crowns, down from 1.69 billion crowns in 1995. In the accounts, the company allocated 800 million crowns for restructuring costs linked to Fokus '98, the programme implemented in the fourth quarter last year to reduce costs. Operating revenues fell eight percent to 7.74 billion crowns. "The main reason for the decline in operating revenues was a the price pressure on contrast media, which to some degree has been offset by higher sales volumes," a company statement said. The operating profit before Research & Development costs was 2.23 billion crowns, down from 2.85 billion in 1995. R&D costs fell to 896 million crowns from 931 million. Nycomed last October reported a 32 percent drop in nine-month pre-tax profits and blamed the decline on lower U.S. sales for Omnipaque, its main X-ray contrast agent. Under Focus '98, Nycomed plans to adjust group strategy to reduce costs in some areas and increase investment in others, while strengthening core activities. The board said it would propose a dividend of three crowns per share for 1996 to the annual general meeting. The drug company, one of the largest in Scandinavia, has been under pressure to rethink strategy since last June when it warned that intensive competition in the North American market for diagnostic contrast agents would have a severe impact on group revenues in 1996. Nycomed was demerged from energy group Hafslund ASA in May last year and listed separately on the Oslo bourse. --Rolf Soderlind, Oslo newsroom, +47 22 42 50 41
CCAT	Heavy engineering group Evans Deakin Ltd said on Monday that it anticipated another record result for the 1996/97 year and that its orders on hand and future prospects indicated a good longer term outlook.   Evans Deakin chairman Ron Paul said when releasing the group's half year results that orders on hand at December 31 totalled A$475 million. "Mr Paul added that the group was anticipating another record year and that the orders on hand and future prospects indicate a good longer term outlook," Evans Deakin said. Evans Deakin reported a net profit of A$9.09 million for the six months to December 31, up from A$6.05 million in the previous corresponding half. It set an unchanged dividend of seven cents.   Evans Deakin reported a net profit of A$14.11 million in the year to June 30, 1996. The first half net profit of A$9.09 million was a record. Earnings per share for the half fell however to 11.2 cents per share from 12 cents, "reflecting the significant increase in issued capital to fund the acquisition of Clyde Industries," Evans Deakin said. Sales jumped to A$409.44 million for the half from A$133.77 million a year earlier due to the acquisition of Clyde and strong revenue growth at its Walkers, Evans Deakin Engineering and Ralph M Lee units.   "The result was satisfactory considering the price pressures and subdued levels of demand in some of the markets we service and having regard to the task of integrating the Clyde businesses acquired," Paul said in a statement. Evans Deakin repeated that it expected to sell the balance of its chemicals businesses over the next six months, having sold its Wolseley Castle division in the last six months. Evans Deakins' share price was up five at A$3.39 at 2.15 p.m. (0315 GMT). -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800

ECAT	New Zealand Treasurer Winston Peters said in notes for a speech to parliament on Thursday that he expected the net impact of one-off fiscal items would be to reduce the level of budget surplus expected for 1997/98. Although he did not specify the degree of impact, Peters said he could reassure parliament that the government would still be expecting a surplus "and a surplus large enough to continue to provide a buffer if the economy or other events prove to be less favourable than we are currently predicting".   "The main drivers of this change in forecasts are cyclical. They do not represent a change in the government's policies, nor do they represent much ongoing impact on the government's fiscal position. "But this does mean some of the questions that some commentators have recently been asking about the government's policy response to the surplus are wide of the mark," Peters added.   Peters gave two examples of "one-off and technical matters" that would impact on the operating surplus, noting the overall effect of a series of them would be to reduce the surplus. "We had previously included provision for a settlement with Ngai Tahu in the 1996/97 fiscal year. It's now clear that this settlement will occur in the 1997/98 year," the notes said. Under an agreement in principle struck last October, the government is to make a NZ$170 million settlement in land and cash to the South Island Maori tribe.   He also cited technical changes to superannuation forecasting which added to next year's expenditure, but gave no financial details.
ECAT	South Korea again denied on Tuesday official involvement in a frugality campaign that has hit imports ranging from cars to televisions, and said it would set up an office to hear importers' complaints. The anti-import austerity campaign has angered some of South Korea's trading partners, which maintain the drive targets imports and is backed by the government. Similar campaigns in the past were encouraged by the government. But in a statement, the Foreign Ministry said the country's "dire" economic circumstances had prompted the media and civic groups to blame excessive consumption for a widening trade deficit. "It is against this background that some non-governmental civic groups, of their own accord, initiated frugality campaigns aimed at discouraging extravagant consumption and encouraging practical consumerism," the ministry said. Recent trade figures have shown a marked decrease in South Korea's imports of consumer goods. South Koreans have associated imports with unneeded luxury items. The Foreign Ministry statement said the government would designate the Division of International Cooperation of the Ministry of Finance and Economy to handle "import grievances". The Trade Ministry would also expand its Trade and Investment Facilitation Office by adding a grievance hot-line and assigning an expert to deal with importers' complaints, the statement said.
CCAT	The war of words between British Gas and the industry watchdog Ofgas turned sour again on Thursday as Ofgas director general Clare Spottiswoode dismissed the company's attitude as "not serious." Earlier the company rejected proposals by Ofgas for a new pricing regime at its pipeline and storage arm TransCo, triggering a lengthy Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. Spottiswoode told reporters "this has not been a process where we felt they were seriously in discussion."   She said British Gas had held only about four or five meetings with Ofgas officials over TransCo, and she had met the company only once on this issue since putting forward moderated price control proposals in August. "The situation has been one where they were not involved in negotiations in any real sense. The amount of contact since the final proposals has been very limited." The regulator added that she had made more concessions to British Gas in August "than I felt comfortable with" in order to "give them no excuse for taking it to the MMC."   British Gas accused Ofgas of pursuing "unjustified and unworkable proposals" that would slash 400 million pounds a year from its cashflow, put the safety of its system at risk and lead to further job losses. Spottiswoode wants a one-off cut of 20 percent in the tariffs that TransCo charges to gas suppliers, followed by four years of charges pegged at 6.5 percentage points below inflation. Ofgas believes this would cut about 30 pounds a year from an average household gas bills.   British Gas chairman Richard Giordano accused the regulator of a "flawed" approach, saying British Gas had been refused access to key reports on which Ofgas had based its price proposals. Spottiswoode defended herself against the complaint, saying it would have been unfair to give British Gas full access to information which was denied to their competitors. "There was nothing in it for us and everything in it for British Gas," Spottiswoode added.   British Gas shares fell 6p to 193-1/2p as investors bemoaned the fact that the second MMC enquiry in four years for the company will bring months of continued uncertainty. "British Gas has the hope it may salvage something, but there are absolutely no guarantees," said Irene Himona at broker SG Strauss Turnbull. "This (referral) means we will not find out the full story for the dividend for another nine months," she added. British Gas shareholders had already been let down on Monday by the company's failure to agree the sale of part of its loss-making gas supply business to Scottish Hydro-Electric.   British Gas is already under strain as it tries to re-negotiate so-called "Take-or-Pay" contracts, which oblige the utility to buy gas from North Sea producers at prices well above market rates. Many industry analysts would rather see British Gas swallow the Ofgas proposals and put more effort into unravelling its crippling Take-or-Pay contracts. British Gas, privatised 10 years ago and still struggling on many fronts to cope with the loss of its monopoly, plans to split itself in half next year into a domestic gas supply business known as British Gas Energy and TransCo.

GCAT	Israel said on Tuesday its forces had killed at least one guerrilla during an overnight clash in its south Lebanon occupation zone. "At least one terrorist was killed when an Israeli army force on an operational initiative on the border of the eastern sector of the south Lebanon security zone encountered a terrorist cell," the army said in a statement. It said there were no Israeli casualties. Iranian-backed Hizbollah (Party of God) guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli troops and their local militia allies from a 15-km (nine mile)-wide border zone they hold in south Lebanon. Israel set up the zone in 1985 after withdrawing the bulk of its forces following the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Israel said on Monday its troops had killed two guerrillas. Hizbollah said on Saturday Israel had killed two of its fighters in an air raid.
MCAT	Spanish Economy Secretary Cristobal Montoro said on Friday that Spanish markets were behaving well and he added that the bourse was correcting after sharp and recent gains. "(Spanish) markets are not behaving badly. In this sense what happened to stocks has a lot to do with profit taking after a sharp rally," Montoro told reporters after a seminar. He added that the peseta showed a limited reaction as yields, which is showing "the calm of the Spanish economy". -- Madrid Newsroom, + 341 585 8340
GCAT	The AIDS situation in India may spin out of control in the next few years, medical authorities and volunteers fighting the virus said on Sunday. "India has about five million HIV cases right now," said I.H. Gilada, secretary-general of the Indian Health Organisation, a voluntary organisation working against the spread of the virus in Bombay. "By the turn of the century, this is likely to go up to 20 million in a best-case scenario and 50 million in a worst-case scenario" he said. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). There is no cure for AIDS but several have been found to work against HIV. India's commercial capital of Bombay marked World AIDS day with photo-exhibitions about the dangers of the virus, marches sponsored by charity organisations and a "Race against AIDS" organised by music channel MTV and several social groups. Officials say the western Indian state of Maharashtra and Bombay, its capital, with a population of over 13 million, account for the majority of AIDS cases reported in the country. The city's notorious Kamathipura red-light district houses an estimated 70,000 prostitutes in cramped and often unhygienic conditions. "The situation is certainly grave," state health director Subhash Salunke told Reuters. "What is particularly worrying is the number of cases reporting HIV positive," he said. "The degree of HIV positivity among STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease) cases is about 30 percent," said Salunke. "The state is treating it on a top priority basis." Salunke said the state's fight against AIDS focussed on the youth. "We are targeting adolescents and college youths," he said. "We feel that a proper programme of education about AIDS can save the next generation." The state is also concentrating on counselling prostitutes and truck drivers, who constitute a major part of the visitors to Bombay's red-light areas. The current situation is largely the result of official apathy about AIDS, said Gilada. "There has not been enough official attention given to (the fight against) AIDS," he said. "People have sudenly woken up now that the situation looks like getting out of control." Gilada said that by the year 2000 AIDS patients in India alone would require three times more beds than were available for all patients at present. Yet there was some light at the end of the tunnel, he said. "In recent months we have seen that Bombay has been bypassed by smaller cities in the number of new HIV cases being reported. It appears that a sustained programme of education and high-publicity anti-AIDS campaigns does have some impact." While this offered hopes that the spread of the virus could be contained, it also threw up problems of a different nature. Gilada said funding organisations often wanted to see their work attract attention in the media. "It will be more difficult to attract sponsor funds to campaigns in rural and semi-urban areas where the scope for publicity will be less."

GCAT	An Australian doctor who has helped four people die under a world-first voluntary euthanasia law said on Monday the euthanasia battle would go on even if parliament killed off the law. Speaking hours before the Australian Senate was due to vote on a bill which would quash the Northern Territory law, Dr Philip Nitschke said he believed the legislation had been shown to be viable. "It didn't spell the end of the world, the sky didn't collapse, we got workable legislation," Nitschke told reporters. "Opponents of this progressive change can never again say that this law doesn't work...the world will never be the same again." The anti-euthanasia bill, which has already received a clear majority in the lower house, calls on the government to use its constitutional powers over Australia's territories to quash the Northern Territory law. However, the national government does not have the same power over Australia's largely autonomous states and Nitschke said the fight would continue. "The way to change it, I suppose, is for the Territory to become a state," he said. "These changes will occur," he added. "The question is, will it occur in the Northern Territory or will it occur somewhere else?" Four people have died using the Northern Territory legislation, which has been condemned by church, political and Aboriginal leaders. Two others are ready to use the law even if Senate quashes it.

MCAT	Rubber futures closed steady to easier on Thursday in sluggish trade with only modest buying seen for RSS3 and TSR20 grade rubber, dealers said. "There was almost no difference from the market this morning. We ran into some late liquidation for RSS3 and TSR20 rubber. Action may taper off tomorrow though as we approach the weekend," a dealer for a Singapore-based trading house said. Traders said the market was still looking for heavy buying from major consumers and most houses were on a hand-to-mouth existence at the moment. "The level of action is really sporadic," one dealer said.   Total volume traded for RSS3 grade rubber reached nearly 4,000 tonnes while trades for RSS1 rubber reached a little over 3,000 tonnes, dealers said. At around 0945 GMT, May RSS3 was seen unchanged at 123.25 U.S. cents a kg. May RSS1 was indicated at 174.00-176.00 Singapore cents (US$1.21-$1.23) a kg from 176.00 cents.

MCAT	Taiwan's share index blistered to within 115 points of 10,000 and a seven-year intraday high on Thursday, but lost momentum in the final minutes to salvage only a modest closing gain on all-time record turnover. The electronics sector, which led the early charge on steam from Wall Street's high-tech rally, nosedived in late trade as investors took profits and shifted to other major sectors. The benchmark index throttled technical resistance at 9,600 to notch a sizzling seven-year intraday high 9,889.45, but ended with a gain of just 27.24 points or 0.29 percent at 9,571.8. Turnover screamed to a historic high T$296.8 billion.
ECAT	Pakistan, being the cheapest emerging market, could attract funds leaving the South East Asian markets, which were seen heading for a recession, a foreign fund manager said on Tuesday. "Things are changing in South East Asia," Landon Thomas of Morgan Stanley Asset Management, London, told a business conference in Karachi. "They (South East Asia) are close to a recession, which offers a huge oppurtunity, for a lot of this money can come to Pakistan," he added. Thomas said Pakistan had the cheapest valuation compared to all other emerging markets and could draw an estimated "$50 billion pool of dissatisfied money in the emerging markets looking for a home." But he said Pakistan faced a crisis of confidence and would have to give incentives and undertake reforms to attract funds. "The market is cheap but pessimism is deeper," Thomas said. He said lack of saving, inadequate growth, mismanagement of economy, political instability and corruption were the reasons that had kept foreign investors out of the Pakistani markets. "Investors would want to see a sea of change," he added. Thomas said Pakistan should push through a mix of supply and demand side measures to restore long term confidence. Pakistan should also cut military expenditure, impose agriculture tax, hold a population census, go for privatisation and carry out accountability of the corrupt, he added. He said the three-month-old government of Nawaz Sharif was percieved as the strongest in Asia due to its massive mandate and was best placed to bring in concrete reforms. "Once they (foreign investors) sense that the things are on the right path ,there is a rally out there lurking, and will come much earlier."
CCAT	U.S. Facilities Corp said Tuesday it was on track for increased revenues and earnings for the full year 1996 if present business trends continue. U.S. Facilities earned $2.42 a share on revenues of $151.2 million in 1995. The company today reported third quarter earnings of $0.62 a share, up from $0.60 a year earlier. The company said it expects to take no extraordinary charges for losses due to natural disasters such as Hurricane Fran and other storms during the third quarter.
MCAT	CSCE coffee futures shot up on Wednesday, surging to fresh contract highs across-the-board, as speculators bought heavily on near-term supply concerns, traders said. A prolonged dock workers' strike in Colombia and continued speculation about the size of the Brazilian crop exacerbated supply worries in the U.S., where coffee inventories are already at extremely low levels. "This is still a reflection of underlying bullishness linked to a tight situation," said Dean Witter analyst Steve Platt. "It will persist if the the Brazil crop comes in lower as most people suggest." CSCE March delivery jumped to a new life-of-contract high of 137.05 cents a lb before settling at 135.30 cents a lb, up 5.65 cents -- or more than four pecent -- on the day. On the continuous weekly chart, March's finish was the highest since September 1995. Second-position May ended up 4.85 cents, to 130.85 cents, while the outer months closed 3.75 to 4.75 cents higher. Volume was heavy, at an estimated 15,897 lots. After posting gains seven sessions in row, traders said today's rally was sparked by a report from Wall Street firm Merrill Lynch suggesting the tight supply situation could drive prices to as high as 200.00 cents a lb by mid-1997. The report said aggressive purchasing by European roasters had absorbed the new crop supply of coffee and caused U.S. inventories to dwindle. "Total supplies have not been this tight in 20 years," the report said. "Although it is hard to prove statistically, we believe arabica supplies might be the tightest on record." Merrill Lynch said the market outlook hinged on the Brazilian 1997/98 coffee harvest and the response of the Brazilian government to release holdings should the crop be reduced. Preliminary forecasts by the Brazilian government have pegged the country's 1997/98 coffee crop between 18 million and 20 million 60-kg bags compared with an estimated 25 million bags the previous season. "We have a balanced situation with a larger Brazilian crop," Dean Witter's Platt said. "With a smaller crop, you are looking at an explosive situation." Traders said other factors, such as the port strike at the Colombian port of Buenaventura and uncertainty ahead of a meeting Thursday of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries meeting in Rio de Janeiro, also underpinned the market. Dock workers will resume talks with government officials and cargo handling operators to resolve the strike this afternoon. The work stoppage, which entered its eighth day, has blocked shipment of more than 300,000 60-kg bags of coffee exports. ((--Patricia Avidan, New York Commodities Desk +1 212 859 1640))
GCAT	Edmonton Oilers centre Doug Weight, an emerging star who excelled for the victorious USA team in the recent World Cup, ended his holdout Tuesday, agreeing to a two-year contract with the club. Financial terms were not disclosed, but the Canadian Press news agency reported that the deal was worth $2.3 million per season. Weight, who missed all of pre-season, joined the team Tuesday night in Calgary and will practice with the club Wednesday in preparation for Friday's season opener. "There was never any question that I wanted him to play here and that Doug Weight wanted to be an Edmonton Oiler," Oilers President and General Manager Glen Sather said after ending tough negotiations with Weight's agent Steve Bartlett. "He's becoming a superstar in Edmonton ... the kind of player we can build our future around. I feel he's reached the level of one of the best in this league," added Sather, who said he expects Weight to lead the team into the playoffs this season. The Oilers have missed post-season for the last four years. The 25-year-old Weight enjoyed his best season in 1995-96, leading the Oilers with career highs of 25 goals and 79 assists. His 104 points put him 11th in league in overall scoring and he was tied for fifth in assists with Wayne Gretzky. Weight has led Edmonton in scoring the last three seasons, amassing 56 goals and 162 assists.
MCAT	Thai stocks closed down in active trade on Thursday on profit taking and fading hopes that Thailand may get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund and Japan to boost its battered economy, brokers said. The composite SET index finished off 7.38 points or 1.11 percent at 656.28. The SET-50 index eased 0.68 points to 49.68. "Investors were slowing down their buying after news that Thailand is not seeking financial support from IMF," said one broker at Thaimex Finance and Securities. "Its also consolidation after most shares made big gains recently."
MCAT	The dollar advanced, forging a 41-month high against the mark before midday as the German currency was sapped of strength on the crosses, traders said. "The move is almost completely fueled by talk of a soft euro currency and concern that there will be broad inclusion in the European monetary union," said Mike Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco Group Ltd. A mark/yen decline to a new 23-month low of 63.99 tested key support and exacerbated mark selling pressure. Dollar gains were mostly a by-product of active cross-trading, dealers said.   The dollar was quoted at 1.7585/88 marks at noon compared with its open at 1.7540/50 marks and Monday's close of 1.7530/40. It broke through 1.76 shortly after noon. Sterling/mark remained strong and underpinned the dollar. A surprisingly strong rise in British inflation and the likelihood of a minimum 25 basis point rate hike lifted the pound and some expected a peak above 3.00 before week's end. "It's been really one way price action for a while and it looks like there's nothing to stop it for the time being," said James Powers, vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Westdeutche Landesbank Girozentrale.   "It's difficult to buy sterling at these levels, however, it just seems to go higher," Powers said. In midday trade, the dollar held above its opening level of 112.60/70 yen to trade at 112.65/75. Despite an improving bid, dealers said bias was to sell dollars toward 112.00 and ahead of Wednesday's release of Japan's current account data. Comments from Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara that Japan's foreign exchange goals had not changed signaled a favored 110-120 dollar/yen range and helped the dollar early, but fell out of focus in U.S. time, dealers said. The dollar rose as high as 113.45 yen after the remark.   "We expect to find some bids down at the 112 level," Powers said. "For the most part it seems that the interest is to sell on rallies. The dollar went up a big figure after Sakakibara's comments and it probably shouldn't have, now we're right back down around the 112.50 level. In other markets, the dollar rose slightly against the Swiss franc at midday to 1.4635/45 from 1.4630/40 at the open. It was weaker at Canadian $1.3741/46 at midday from C$1.3770/75 at the open.

GCAT	Bulgaria's foreign ministry said on Wednesday the NATO-Russia security pact opens the way for partnership in Europe and may boost chances of this Balkan country to join NATO. "This historic accord, which formally ends the era of confrontation in Europe and clears the way for the alliance to expand eastwards, gives us grounds to reaffirm Bulgaria's strong desire to join NATO," Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaikov told a news conference. NATO leaders and Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed on Tuesday the Founding Act on Mutual Relations desgined to bind Russia into efforts to create a new European security order. "We praise the Russia-NATO accord which ends an era of confrontation in Europe and reaffirms the rignt of each country to decide how to guarantee its security," said Vlaikov. He said the accord, which abolishes the division lines created in Yalta, has increased the hopes of Bulgaria that its active and clear policy towards NATO will be considered. In mid February Bulgaria's caretaker government adopted a declaration stating a desire for a full NATO membership in a move to clear the so far ambiguous policy on the issue of the country's former Socialist rulers. Bulgaria's Union of Democratic Forces, which won the April general election and formed a cabinet last week, has set the country's NATO membership as a main foreign policy priority. NATO is expected to issue the first invitations to prospective new members at a summit in Madrid in July and Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are considered the most likely candidates to join in the first wave of enlargement.

CCAT	Shares in glass-maker Saint-Gobain fell heavily on Tuesday, reflecting concerns over weak prices, analysts said after a company presentation . "There was a message of prudence for the 1997 year. I think that is having an effect and analyses are being revised downward, which is what I am doing," said a broker. Chairman Jean-Louis Beffa told analysts this morning that prices in Europe were weak and Saint-Gobain would find out in the second half whether the trend would continue. The shares were down 4.46 percent at 814 francs at 1423 GMT, while the market was down 3.07 percent.   There was a message that estimates for the current year should "take account of the effect of prices in Europe, which is tied to the fact that growth is not very strong," the analyst said. But it was possible Saint-Gobain could change its cautious outlook in the course of the year, he added. In any case there should be a catch-up in 1998 if weak prices held throughout this year, he said. A forecast 20 percent jump in profit for the 1997 year was tied to a one-off capital gain of 900 million francs on the sale of Cise to Bouygues. Another analyst said he was taking the comments on weak prices as a "profit warning". -- Pierre Tran, Paris newsroom +33 1 4221 5452 pnt
MCAT	British stocks will be hoping to catch their breath in the coming week after surprise anti-inflation comments from Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan sent a tremor through world markets on Friday. Yet in a week packed with inflation indicators on both sides of the Atlantic, markets seem likely to remain in a jittery mood, worried about the outlook for interest rates and inflation through 1997. And in the UK, the unstable political situation could also unsettle the markets, with Prime Minister John Major obliged on Friday to declare his full support for finance minister Kenneth Clarke after reports of policy disagreements between the two. Markets are anyway likely to remain on edge in the run-up to the key December 17 meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's key policy-making Open Markets Committee (FOMC). "The weekend press will be filled with speculation about splits, that the Tories will dump Clarke," said Andy Hartwill, strategist at brokerage SocGen, "and the markets will be volatile at least until the December 17 FOMC meeting." On Friday Conservative party legislator John Gorst said he was leaving the ruling parliamentary party, wiping out the government's majority of one. Some traders said the Friday fall-out was no more than a bout of profit-taking on the strong gains seen this year in equities on both sides of the Atlantic. Friday's lower-than-expected U.S. employment report also helped calm fears that economic growth is poised to revive, boosting hopes that inflation is unlikely to become a problem anytime soon. Yet others pointed out that Greenspan's comments about the "irrational exuberance" of markets seemed to have been aimed specifically at capping the rip-roaring market gains seen this year. "With my hand on my heart I could not say I would be a buyer at these levels," said trader in UK stocks. "There is no point in being a hero in these markets." UK economic reports this week include producer prices for November on Monday and retail prices on Thursday. In the U.S., producer prices, consumer prices and retail sales reports are also released during the week. In a sparse week for UK company results, groups reporting include Chubb Security Plc, British Land Plc, London Electricity Plc and Greenall Plc. The FTSE 100 index of blue chip stocks on Friday tumbled more than 150 points at one stage, before rallying towards the close as Wall Street steadied after an expected early tumble. The FTSE's decline took the index at one stage to its lowest level since September 6. The index set a record intraday level of 4,094.4 on November 26.
GCAT	Massachusetts officials announced on Friday they found the official seal to the document that created the Massachusetts Bay Colony 368 years ago. The seal, a blackened clump of beeswax bearing the crest of Britain's King Charles I, was affixed to the first page of the charter of Massachusetts Bay Colony. It was stolen from the state archives in 1984. "This charter document was the founding document of the Massachusetts Bay Colony," William Galvin, Massachusetts Secretary of State, told reporters. "And we are not only entitled by this document actually to our current lands here in Massachusetts, but by the terms of the document it says we're entitled to sea-to-sea. So that's our claim to California." The charter's first page was recovered in 1985, but police 10 miles (16 km) south of Boston in Randolph, Massachusetts, recovered the seal on Wednesday while making a firearms arrest. The police notified the state archives and an expert verified their find which was being kept in a plastic bag. The seal and the charter were put in a vault at the state archives building in Boston, officials said.
GCAT	Many cities stage African-American arts festivals, but few can lay as much claim to preservation of the crafts, arts, architecture, music, and language of Africa and the Caribbean as this former U.S. colonial slave port. "Moja, A Celebration of African-American and Caribben Art," a weeklong festival running here through Sunday, is a colourful panoply of theatre, dance, music and visual arts. It includes, for example, a tribute to Josephine Baker of 1920s Paris' "La Revue Negre," a juried arts show, jazz, and reggae block parties reminiscent of Caribbean festivals. But the Moja festival, which takes its name from the Swahili word meaning "one," also pays homage to home grown arts and artists who carry on centuries-old traditions. "The whole idea of Moja is to foster appreciation for African-American artists' contribution to world culture," said Ellen Dressler Moryl, city cultural affairs office director. There's a competition in South Carolina's country art of sweetgrass basketmaking -- which are woven row upon row and taught by mother to daughter only on the sea islands of South Carolina and Georgia, and the west coast countries of Africa. Master blacksmith Philip Simmons, 83, has been signing minatures of the wrought-iron gates he has forged since the 1940s. Named a national treasure, he has built on the tradition of colonial slave ironwork preserved here. In the galleries of the Dock Street Theatre, the oldest public theatre in the country, hang the family and heritage storytelling quilts of local quilter Marlene Seabrook. This week, the Charleston Symphony Orchestra will perform the U.S. premiere of "Charlestonia" by Edmund Jenkins, an African-American expatriate who was a fellow at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He lived in Paris most of his life and was a prolific composer of what was called American "symphonic jazz" in the early part of this century. He was the son of the Reverend Daniel Joseph Jenkins, founder of the Jenkins Orphanage and its world-famous travelling jazz bands who played "The Charleston" on street corners here. But shunned as a black classical composer in this country, Jenkins wrote "Charlestonia" in 1917 in Europe and based its melodies on tunes sung by African-American fishermen and dockworkers on the wharves of Charleston. It was first performed in Belgium in 1925, but was lost with Jenkins' other work after his death, only to be found within the last few years in a steamer trunk in a relative's home. Composer Vincent Plush has reconstructed the piece. An original play, "Hush Dat Gullah," nods to the unique "geechie" people of the isolated sea islands who have preserved their cultural attitudes, customs, relgious practices and Gullah language, which contains much West African syntax and vocabulary, through 300 years. For years, said Art Gilliard, executive director of the festival who is directing the play, it was not a language that people were proud of or aspired to speak. "Hush Dat Gullah lets people know that there's no need to be ashamed of your language. It's the only language that depicts who you are and where you came from," Gilliard said. "We really are trying to highlight or showcase the things that have a direct link to Africa ... that comes from the Motherland."
MCAT	Spot bulk electricity prices in the southeastern U.S. Thursday held steady versus Wednesday's level in another thinly traded session. Moderate spot demand in the region continued to mitigate concerns over this week's volatility in the natural gas market, traders said. Swing natural gas prices at Henry Hub, La., finished today in the $3.70 per million British thermal unit area, up 35 percent from a week ago. Relatively pleasant late autumn weather was forecast to remain in Florida and the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC) district Friday. Friday's temperatures in SERC was expected to peak in 50s-60s Fahrenheit and bottom in the 30s-40s, and those in Florida were predicted to peak in the 70s-80s and bottom in the 50s-60s. Among Florida utilities, 12-hour block power for Friday was again discussed in the $27.00-$29.00 a megawat. At the Georgia/Florida border, firm, peak electricity in 16 hour blocks for Friday held at $21.00-$23.00, while firm, off-peak power stayed in the $17.00-$18.00 range. A 518 megawatt gas-fired unit at the Northside generating station in Jacksonville, Fla., was expected to resume operation Monday following a maintenance shutdown that began earlier this month. Spot prices at the northern end of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) territory firmed today amid rising spot prices in northern districts such as the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP) and East Central Area Reliability Coordination Agreement (ECAR). Peak, firm electricity for Friday delivery into northern TVA was assessed at $18.00-$19.00, higher than Wednesday's $17.00-$18.00.

MCAT	Overnight volatility on Wall Street and a see-sawing response to key U.S. economic data in the afternoon unsettled the German share market on Wednesday, and prices finally ended the day at lower levels. The IBIS DAX index, which tracks all-day screen dealings in German blue chips, closed the day down 30.32 points at 2,997.95, having swung to highs of over 3,000 points and a low of 2,978 in a turbulent U.S.-driven afternoon session. Earlier, the DAX index, which was catching up on a surge in late screen trading Tuesday, ended floor trade at 2,999.20, 9.87 points higher than Tuesday's mid-afternoon close. Dealers said orders were thin and investors confused as to how to judge the U.S. economy. The afternoon's inconclusive reaction by other markets to what appeared to be soft durable goods order data from the U.S. added to market nerves. "Frankly, I don't know what to make of it and nor does anyone else," said a Frankfurt trader. "Those looked like encouraging numbers but we still saw Bunds shoot up and plunge back down. It's only natural investors will be cautious." The weaker dollar also weighed on prices. Bank shares remained under pressure, with Deutsche Bank ending the day down 2.20 marks at 82.45 while Commerzbank AG extended its decline after Tuesday's below-forecast earnings report for 1996 to end down 87 pfennigs at 42 marks. Preference shares in software company SAP AG dropped as much as 4.8 percent to 220 marks as doubts emerged that the company could meet its own forecasts for 1996 sales and earnings. SAP is due to release 1996 data on Friday. And chemical shares, which gained in earlier trade as the sector caught up on a recent switch to exporters, turned lower in late trade. BASF AG ended down 39 pfennigs at 59.71 marks while Bayer AG dropped 10 pfennigs to 62.23 marks.
ECAT	Mexico's Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz on Friday gave an upbeat forecast for the economy over the year ahead and predicted that increasing domestic and foreign investment would be the engine for growth. "What we are seeing is a strong investment process on the part of both domestic and foreign investors and I think this is going to be the largest single contribution to growth in 1997," he said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Mexico plunged into recession in 1995 after a shock peso devaluation required an International Monetary Fund and U.S. bailout package to haul it back from the brink of collapse. Gross domestic product (GDP) plummeted 6.9 percent in 1995, but preliminary figures show an export-led recovery has brought growth of 4.6 percent last year. Official forecasts predict 4.0 percent growth for 1997, but Ortiz has said that this was a conservative estimate and that the level could well prove higher. "We're not revising official forecasts, but most private sector analysts predict that the economy will be growing at between 4.5 and 5.0 percent," he said on Friday. "I wouldn't argue with them." The government has set itself a 1997 inflation target of 15 percent, and while some analysts predict a level closer to 18 percent, Ortiz said he was standing by the official target. "I think it is feasible," he said. Fears that inflation might be trending upwards were sparked by December's monthly inflation figure which climbed to 3.2 percent from 1.52 percent in November. But Ortiz said this was a one-off. "Inflation ticked up in December...that was a once-and-for-all effect because of some price adjustments," he said. "I think generally inflation will be substantially lower from that of December." He predicted that February's level would be easily below two percent. Some investors are concerned that Mexico's hard-won recovery may also be eroded by rising imports after preliminary data released last week showed exports outpaced imports by only $220 million in December. But Ortiz was unfazed, adding growth in imports was not surprising. "It's something to be expected since the economy is growing strongly," he said. "It's good that imports are growing, particularly imports of capital goods, because that shows that the investment process is coming along." Mexico last week impressed foreign investors with an unexpected early repayment of $5 billion it received as emergency loans from the United States and the IMF. Ortiz said other early payments could follow. "We have repaid our debts to the U.S. in full, but we have still a substantial amount debt with the IMF, and we will try to repay the IMF earlier if possible, if market conditions allow us," he said. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 2734
GCAT	Police in Bogota shot and killed two suspected leftist rebels who were thought to be linked to last week's bomb blast that killed eight policemen, authorities said on Sunday. Diego Antonio Prieto, 44, said to be the No. 4 leader of the National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's second largest guerrilla group, died along with fellow rebel Ana Victoria Ruiz, 24, as they tried to flee police aboard a public bus on Saturday. "We have evidence to suggest these two were linked to (last week's) attack on a police station in which several agents died," Gen. Ismael Trujillo told the respected El Espectador newspaper. Eight policemen were killed in an explosion on Tuesday as they searched for contraband goods in the back of a truck in the parking lot of a police station in Bogota's southwest suburb of Fontibon. The vehicle was taken to the station for inspection after it was abandoned in Fontibon's main square. Six people have so far been arrested in connection with the blast.

MCAT	European oil swaps fell on Thursday as oil markets were dragged lower by news that the German government planned to sell some of its oil reserves this year. The only exception to the trend was naphtha which gained $1 a tonne, support by Asian demand. Brent futures were trading some 25 cents a barrel lower by mid-afternoon and Brent CFD swaps, which have been firm in recent days, followed suit. Brent CFDs slipped a couple of cents a barrel for next week's dates to talk 13 cents under September while the following three weeks slipped about seven to 10 cents a barrel. Monthly CFDs were also under pressure talking 26 cents under the front IPE Brent for the balance of the year. Gas oil crack spreads against Brent were heard traded at $4.25 a barrel for 4Q97 compared to $4.30 and $4.35 on Wednesday. Gasoline swaps slipped $2 a tonne trading at $185 for August during the afternoon and easing to $182.50 for physical barges in Rotterdam. By the close dealers pegged levels at $184.50 July, $185 August and $183.75 September. Naphtha bucked the weaker trend, gaining $1 a tonne to $180.50 for both August and September. Dealers said the widening crack spread against Brent reflected support from Asia and some tightness of end July supply. Heavy fuel swaps were little changed from Thursday as support from the U.S. and Singapore was offset by falling Brent futures. Rotterdam barges edged up to $86.50 on the physical market and July swaps ended around $85.25 with August at $86.50. Forward levels were little changed with the fourth and first quarters at $92.50 and $96 respectively. Low sulphur also held steady at $92.50 for July but rose to $99 for the fourth quarter and $101.50 for the first quarter next year. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 4984
ECAT	Investors will not worry about a delay in Manila ending more than 30 years of IMF supervision, as long as the reason for the delay -- Congressional agreement on tax reforms -- is eventually sorted out, analysts said on Wednesday. But political bickering over the crucial tax reform package means a bill cannot get through Congress, as required, in time for the planned exit from the IMF programme on June 23. "What is more important is the fiscal position of the government will remain in positive territory. What is more critical is the passage of the reform programme," ING Barings Securities research head Jose Mario Cuyegkeng. "The exit will follow as long as investors are assured of the sustainability of the fiscal picture," he added. Senate ways and means committee chairman Juan Ponce Enrile said earlier the Senate, due to go into recess on Thursday and reconvene in the third week of July, would only be able to pass the tax reform bill in three months. "We cannot finish it (this week). The most we can do is try to finish it not later than end of August," he told reporters. The bill is the last of a package of major tax reforms since President Fidel Ramos took office in 1992. The bill, which aims to generate 18 billion pesos a year, would expand the number of people who pay income tax and overhaul the corporate income tax structure. The Senate is still deliberating on its bill. One already passed by the House of Representatives gives too many exemptions since Congressmen are jockeying to get re-elected in next year's elections. Analysts, however, warned that a delay in the passage of the last tax component beyond December could result in lower economic growth in later years. "Delays will definitely hamper the growth if they are too long...Initially there may be cutbacks in infrastructure spending," said Philippine TA Securities economist Rolando Valenzuela. Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said the government has not decided whether to let the IMF programme lapse or seek an extension. President Fidel Ramos said last week the government may opt for an extension. -- Manila Newsroom (63 2) 841-8937 Fax 817-6267

GCAT	The victorious South African Springboks left Paris on Sunday looking ahead to what they regard as the ultimate test -- the Tri-Series in the southern hemisphere next season. "The Springboks have been very successful," said coach Andre Markgraaff of a tour in which South Africa have won four tests, two in Argentina and two in France -- including Saturday's 13-12 second test victory -- with an unchanged side. "But we won't see the result until next year in the Tri-Series," he added. South Africa, rebuilding after their World Cup triumph on home soil last year, regard their arch-rivals New Zealand and Australia along with themselves as the three best sides in the world. Springboks assistant coach Nick Mallett said: "I saw a very good French team, very different to that in Bordeaux (which lost the first test 22-12). "France are still the fourth team in the world," he said. Before Saturday's decisive test, Markgraaff had said: "We are playing for our future in the second test. If we win the series in France, we will have proved, in South Africa, that we're on the right track. We need this second win against France to start 1997 on the right foot." The results obtained by southern hemisphere teams currently touring Europe are ample proof, if it was still needed, of where the game's power base lies. South Africa, Australia, Western Samoa and the New Zealand Barbarians -- virtually the All Blacks -- have all enjoyed significant successes in Europe in the last month. Only the amateur Argentine Pumas look likely to cede a win to Europe when they face England at Twickenham on Saturday. The French, at a precarious stage in their rebuilding for the 1999 World Cup, could not find the answers to South Africa's extremely efficient although not revolutionary game. This is galling for the French who regard the touring team as quite beatable and feel they could have won if they had not been deprived of at least six key players through injury. But they have recognised that the Springboks are brilliant at their game based on the power of their forwards and crunching tackling in defence. "A Springbok on the field means tackle, tackle, tackle," said Mallet. Markgraaff, however, is wary of the limitations of South Africa's game when it comes to the crunch encounters with their southern hemisphere rivals. "This is not exactly how we want to play but the players want to win and that's what is most important on tour." The French have taken heart from a much improved performance after their poor showing in Bordeaux last weekend. "What we must hold on to is the team's capacity to recover on a mental level," said manager Jo Maso. "If one day we manage also to steady and develop our game, we'll have a great team." Coach Jean-Claude Skrela said: "We were perfect as far as the challenge was concerned but we lacked tactical lucidity." He particularly criticised his team's poor tactical kicking in open play. France will need to work hard on their game with newly acquired young players like promising wing Laurent Leflmand, who won his first cap on Saturday, for the Five Nations tournament next year in which holders England start as favourites. Giant number eight Abdelatif Benazzi, who took over the captaincy from injured wing Philippe Saint-Andre, said: "The (Five Nations) tournament is coming up and we must relearn our basics."

ECAT	Canada's Finance Minister Paul Martin reaffirmed on Thursday that the budget deficit for 1995-96 will come in under C$30 billion.   "I've already stated they (the budget deficit figures) will come in slightly under C$30 (billion)," he said. Responding to a question about whether Quebec might not meet its budget deficit target, Martin declined to speculate. "I think it's very important, obviously, for Quebec, that they hit their deficit targets," Martin said.   The Canadian government previously targeted a deficit of C$32.7 billion for fiscal 1995/96 ended March 31. Martin has projected a 1996/97 budget deficit of C$24.3 billion and a 1997/98 budget deficit of C$17 billion. Martin made comments to reporter in Toronto following a speech to launch Canada Investment and Savings, which was previously known as the Canadian Retail Debt Agency. The agency was established last year to revitalize the sale of Canada Savings Bonds and other Government of Canada retail debt products. -- Jeffrey Hodgson (416) 941-8105, e-mail: jeffrey.hodgson@reuters.com
ECAT	Widespread abuse of fringe benefits made it tempting to consider banning them, but this was not practically possible now, South African Revenue Services Commissioner Trevor van Heerden said on Tuesday. He told the parliamentary finance committee that fringe benefits basically allowed people to reduce their tax liability and all that SARS could do was try to crack down on any abuse. "This makes it very attractive to say: let us ban fringe benefits, because that would make life simpler for ourselves." It would also make it simpler for large employers to attract staff away from smaller businesses, who could not offer better salary packages. "There is much merit in actually banning fringe benefits if it was possible, but I don't think that it is practically possible at this stage." He knew of no other country in the world that used tax legislation to prevent fringe benefits and this could perhaps only be done through labour legislation that did not allow remuneration in kind. -- Parliamentary office +27 21 403-2502
GCAT	Republican challenger Bob Dole went into Wednesday's final election debate with President Bill Clinton accusing his administration of not taking charges of ethical misconduct seriously. Dole, who is far behind in the polls less than three weeks before the Nov. 5 election, appeared relaxed and ready for a tough debate with Clinton after a tour of the Shiley Theatre at the University of San Diego where the 90-minute showdown will take place at 9 P.M. EDT (0100 GMT). "They don't take it seriously. That's the trouble with this White House," Dole said when asked about Clinton not responding to his charges on ethical controversies. "They don't take any of this seriously. That's the problem," he told reporters, adding that by not responding directly "he (Clinton) underscored the problem." Asked if he worried that criticism of Clinton might backfire, Dole shook his head. He said he would "talk about the future, people's problems, how we're going to solve them, how we're going to address the problems -- it will be over before you know it." The Republican candidate played down speculation that the debate was a "do or die" situation for his presidential bid where he must win strongly to catch up with Clinton. "No, I don't think so," he said. "We're moving ahead. The race is tightening up. I feel good about it. Happy to have the debate -- we'd like to have more but they would only agree to two -- I guess this will be the last one." Asked what he had to do in the town-meeting part of the debate, Dole said he would have to "talk a lot about our economic plan and we'll talk about some of the things the president promised and didn't deliver and some of the things he didn't promise and did deliver." Dole aides, seeking to lower expectations, said Clinton was going into the debate "a prohibitive favourite." The debate is vital for Dole, who still lags behind his Democratic rival by double digits in public opinion polls. Dole on Tuesday gave what could be a preview of his strategy in the face-off, telling a business audience: "No administration has been more self-righteous. But few administrations have been more self-serving. No administration has shown more arrogance. But few have displayed more ethical failures." Clinton, who rehearsed for the debates in New Mexico, dismissed Dole's tongue-lashing as just politics, but Clinton campaign press secretary Joe Lockhart said Dole's remarks showed "the attack dog has been unleashed," referring to criticism of Dole in earlier campaigns as meanspirited. In his speech on Tuesday, Dole counted off a series problems that have faced the Democratic White House including "more than 30 Clinton officials investigated, fired, or forced to resign due to ethical improprieties." Dole has rarely made direct reference to the Whitewater investigation of a land deal Clinton and his wife, Hillary, invested in when they lived in Arkansas. But on Tuesday he again demanded that Clinton "should clearly promise there will be no (presidential) pardons in legal cases that personally concern him," alluding to Clinton's convicted Whitewater partners, Susan and James McDougal. Former Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said in morning television talk shows on Wednesday that Dole's call for no pardons was "hypocrisy." Walsh, who during the Reagan administration investigated the secret arms sales to Iran to finance arms for Nicaragua "Contra" rebels, said Dole was "the foremost advocate" of a pardon for former Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger. Walsh, who has been writing a book, "Firewall: The Iran- Contra Conspiracy and Cover-up," said in a statement that Dole lobbied then- President George Bush to pardon Weinberger ahead of his trial on charges related to the affair. Bush did pardon Weinberger. "Senator Dole's demand that President Clinton forego future pardons connected with Whitewater gives the voters a remarkable view of Dole's hypocrisy ...." Walsh said.
MCAT	Crude prices in the U.S. Gulf remained weaker in Monday afternoon activity, while cash grade differentials steadied at slightly easier levels. August West Texas Intermediate/Cushing talked around 10-15 cents weaker at $19.10-20 a barrel, also working lower against the September contract, leaving Aug/Sep spreads at -23 cents. Cash dealers were not thrilled with volume levels for grade barrels, but parcels have moved for Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James, West Texas Sour and Postings. "It looks like that more than anything fundamental, there are people in the market looking to shed some length," said a trader in the Gulf. LLS/St. James remained at a 20-22 cents premium to August WTI/Cushing, steady from Friday. Midland barrels edged out to talk at 25-27 cents below the marker, while Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire hovered at 25 cents below level. Cash prices softened for WTS, with barrels switching hands at $1.25-27 under August WTI/Cushing. Traders saw two significant bullish factors erased from the market on Monday, and one bearish issue heighten. First, Iraq officially handed over their aid distribution to the United Nations leadership on Monday, setting in motion what should be the final steps for implementing "oil-for-food" accord oil sales. Once Secretary-General Kofi Annan approves the plan, all that is left before sales can resume is submission of a new pricing formula for basing Iraqi contracts with lifters. The bullish issues eliminated include the passing of Hurricane Danny through the U.S. Gulf without major damage inflicted on the U.S. refining and production belt. Buying was seen ahead of the storm in case refineries or production platforms were disabled and caused a near-term supply squeeze. Lastly, the strength sour crude barrels assumed last week faded as Cano Limon production returned to normal in Colombia. Rebel attacks on the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline forced Cano output cuts and force majeure declarations. ((--Patrick Connole, NY Energy Desk, +1 212 859 1828))

CCAT	Investors from Mexico and abroad have shown strong interest at the start of the process to sell off troubled bank assets, a source close to the deal said on Monday. "Even though we're not allowed to say how many buyers there are of the (information) packages, we can say that it has been above expectations, that the information has been bought and that a lot of foreign groups have shown a great interest in taking part," the source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. The deadline for buying the packages with details of the 150 million pesos of assets initially up for sale is June 13. They represent the opening salvo in the government's sale of some 42 billion pesos of loans bought or seized off banks during the recent financial crisis. The sale is being handled by an agency known as the Valuation and Sale of Assets (VVA). The sole winner of the first 150 million peso package is scheduled to be announced on July 9.

MCAT	* Shares close down with European markets softer on jitters over French elections next Sunday and with general nervousness generating profit-taking, brokers said. Eyes on Nokia in U.S. after quiet day. Small caps Larox and Raute gain on big orders. ------------------------ (May 28) ---------------------------- Shares ended lower on Wednesday, reflecting weakness in European markets fraught with nerves over the political situation in France and with general jitters triggering profit-taking at home, brokers said. The FOX stock futures index closed down 0.76 percent at 1,062.54 points, while the less-watched all-share HEX fell 0.89 percent to 3,066.34. Fair volume topped half a billion markka. Nokia led the decline, ending 5.40 markka lower at 346.00, with brokers looking to the bourse bellwether's Wall Street performance for direction on Thursday. Nokia accounted for almost 40 percent of total turnover.   After a buoyant offering Rauma followed the weak trend, falling 1.40 markka to 121.00 in hefty 58 million markka trade, making it the session's second-most traded share. Forestries underperformed the market, with the subindex dropping 0.94 percent, with the falls in UPM-Kymmene at 1.20 markka to 119.00, Enso 0.50 to 47.50 and Metsa-Serla 1.00 to 40.50. Small cap Larox rose 3.50 markka to 61.50, or more than six percent, after announcing orders worth 70 million markka from mining customers. Big orders also helped Raute up 3.00 markka to 52.00, brokers said.

The quota, being established on Feb 8, 1997, applies to cotton purchased not later than May 8, 1997 and entered into the United States not later than Aug 6, 1997, USDA said. The quota amount is for the period Sept 1996 through Nov 1996.
MCAT	Asian dollar deposit rates were quietly steady in moderate trade on Tuesday with most traders sidelined ahead of tonight's release of the U.S. second quarter productivity/unit labor costs data, dealers said. Productivity in the second quarter is forecast to have risen 0.7 percent after a 2.6 percent increase reported in the first quarter. Unit labor costs for the second quarter is expected to be around 2.7 percent against the first quarter's 2.5 percent. "Rates were narrowly mixed in the morning on some position adjustments amid uncertainty over the near term direction of the market," a local dealer said.   "Some traders were waiting for fresh clues to market direction from tonight's release of the second quarter productivity/unit labor costs figures, but unless the numbers are way off market expectations, I don't think there will be much impact," he said. In day-to-day rates, Tuesday/Wednesday eased 1/16 percentage point to 5-9/16 5-7/16 percent, Wednesday/Thursday rose 1/16 point to 5-11/16 5-9/16 and week-fixed eased 1/16 point to 5-9/16 5-7/16 percent.   Among longer dates, two-months was unchanged from Monday's 5-11/16 5-9/16 percent, four-months was unchanged from Monday's 5-3/4 5-5/8, six-months unchanged at 5-7/8 5-3/4 and twelve-months unchanged at 6-1/16 5-15/16 percent. -- Singapore Newsroom (65-870-3080)
CCAT	Personal computer maker Tulip Computers NV said on Monday it expected a profit for the full-year 1997 but added the first half of the year would probably not yet be profitable. "The management expects a positive result can be realised for the full-year 1997. But the result for the first half of 1997 may not be positive," the company said in a statement. The Netherlands' only computer manufacturer earlier posted a 1996 net loss of 10.0 million guilders, compared with a profit of 9.2 million in 1995.
GCAT	An Indian court on Wednesday granted former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao legal protection against arrest in a seven-year-old criminal forgery case until October 14.   Delhi High Court Judge S.K. Mahajan said the pre-emptive, or anticipatory, bail would last until a lower court holds a hearing into the forgery case on October 14. Last week a court issued a warrant to arrest Rao in the case. The warrant was temporarily suspended pending Mahajan's decision on Rao's request for protection against arrest. Mahajan said Rao could apply for ordinary bail at the October 14 hearing, when he was scheduled to be formally charged with forgery and two other counts. The forgery case dates from 1989. Federal police have charged Rao and five others with using false documents to defame a rival politician. Rao, who quit as Congress leader last month, has not commented publicly on the case.
ECAT	South Africa has signed two project agreements worth $6 million with the United Nations' Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa, the programme said on Thursday. More than 3,000 South Africans are to benefit from the agreements to provide financial support mainly to blacks disadvantaged under apartheid for tertiary education and for training to upgrade qualifications, it said in a statement.  "Our commitment is to complement the government's efforts to provide qualified cadres needed to build the country's socio- economic development," said the programme's coordinator, Angela Masithela.
ECAT	British consumers continued to borrow heavily in October to finance strong retail spending, Bank of England figures showed Friday, suggesting retailers were in for bumper holiday sales. Britain's Central Bank data showed net consumer credit dipped to 856 million pounds ($1.44 billion) in October from 1.041 billion ($1.74 billion) in September. Economists said despite the decline, the figures were still robust, although a return to the debt-financed boom of the 1980s was unlikely, with a debt overhang from the recession keeping a lid on consumers' ability to borrow more. "Consumers haven't really paid off any debt since the trough of the recession... so there's not the same scope to take on more in the coming year," said HSBC economist Jonathan Loynes. "That's one crucial reason why we're not heading for a repeat of the 1980s boom." The figures provide further evidence that demand is strong in the British economy and that interest rates might have to rise further to prevent a resurgence in inflation. In recent months consumers have steadily returned to the shops, with economists predicting this trend will continue over the next year or so. Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said in his budget speech on Tuesday that consumer spending would grow by 4.25 percent in 1997. He nevertheless predicted that underlying inflation would remain under control, dipping to 2.5 percent in 1997 after surging unexpectedly to 3.3 percent in October  -- a forecast greeted with some scepticism by economists.
MCAT	LIFFE coffee futures regained some strength after early sharp falls to end Tuesday mixed with some nearbys returning to the positive territory. Traders said a technical upward reversal in New York after Monday's heavy sell-off also inspired renewed buying in London in the afternoon. "We may have seen lower levels in New York. The market needs a short-term correction on the upside," said one trader. London's benchmark May was driven to an intraday low of $1,610 a tonne before staging a rebound to a peak of $1,708. It closed just $8 up at $1,698. Other traded positions were $40 down to $12 up. The market had earlier failed to meet its pre-opening expectation of $100-$200 down based on the steep decline on the New York arabica futures overnight. Roasters stepped up buying in the morning as prices made their way lower. Jobbers were seen on the selling side but they retreated as the market turned around. "This initiated speculative buying and roasters also paid up," said one trader. "Funds which had been selling in last few days were not willing to sell at higher prices." The market's volume reached a modest at 5,099 lots. Active May/July switches were traded from $3 to $12. On the charts, May faces a key support at $1,600 and the upside target is seen at the double top of $1,820-$1,825. Broker GNI said earlier on Tuesday the recent retail price increase by major U.S. and European roasters could be a dampener to the recent explosive rally in bean prices. "We have been saying for some time that prices are due to fall due to the recent roaster price increases," it said in a commentary. "The question now is how far can they fall before trade buying comes in and the specs start going long ahead of the (Brazilian) frost season." The U.S. Green Coffee Association data released after the New York market had closed on Monday showed a larger-than-anticipated rise of 204,000 60-kg bags to 1.54 million bags in February from January. The market had anticipated an increase of 50,000 to 100,000 tonnes. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985
GCAT	Long reviled by British holidaymakers for grabbing the best places in the Mediterranean sun, the Germans have now taken the war to the enemy by refusing to budge from a beach in England. A group of German evangelists called the Society for Understanding has failed to live up to its name and is sitting tight on Loe Bar beach in Cornwall, southwestern England, according to news reports on Friday. The group, up to 80 strong, has ignored attempts by police and Loe Bar's owners, the National Trust heritage charity, to have them evicted. The group will only communicate with the authorities by quoting from the Bible in German, according to the Daily Telegraph, although one of them told BBC television, in English, that the beach was "a nice place". Another group spokesman praised the "spirituality" of the location. A 24-vehicle convoy of cars, vans and mobile homes first drove on to the beach two weeks ago. They left peacefully after police threatened to evict them from private property. National Trust workers blocked access to Loe Bar with boulders and a trench, but this proved no match for the Germans, who shifted the boulders and filled in the trench. Scuffles ensued and six people were arrested. The affair has alarmed law-abiding Germans visiting the area, which is a popular holiday destination. "We are very embarrassed, us and our country," one German woman told BBC television.
CCAT	International Business Machines Corp. Monday unveiled a multimedia version of its DB2 database software that allows users to store and manage video and audio as well as text. The new DB2 Universal Database software also will permit users to access DB2 databases on the Internet and intranets, or internal corporate networks, and will enable the creation of electronic commerce software that takes advantage of multimedia databases. IBM said the software is in beta, or customer, testing and will be generally available in mid-1997. Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM announced the new software one day before a much-anticipated announcement by Informix Corp., which was expected to trot out its Universal Server database management system. Informix's database software can also process multiple types of data such as audio, video and text. Oracle Corp. earlier this year announced a similar product, the Oracle Universal Server, which Oracle is planning to incorporate as part of the next big upgrade of its relational database system, Oracle 8, next year. Analysts said both IBM and Informix are ahead of Oracle in incorporating the new technology in their database software. "I think IBM and Informix have a relatively long lead on the rest of the market," said Steve Hendrick, director of application development tools research at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. "What they have is significantly ahead of everyone else." Hendrick added, though, that Informix and IBM will lose their lead if no software is developed to take advantage of the ability to manage such widely different kinds of data as video and text. For example, one typical use in a big database is a programme called the Fingerprint Extender, which captures images of fingerprints and stores them. In this application, a giant database can be used to track down criminals with pattern-matching techniques comparing a fingerprint obtained at a crime scene with fingerprints stored in a database. IBM's DB2 software was initially developed for its mainframe computers. But a few years ago the computer giant introduced new versions to run on the UNIX operating system, such as IBM's version of UNIX and on its OS/2 software. IBM's DB2 Universal Database will run on many different versions of UNIX, IBM's OS/2 software and on Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system.
GCAT	Pakistan's ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto remained a virtual prisoner in her official Islamabad residence on Wednesday, but has been allowed to meet party colleagues and take telephone calls, a government official said. "She met three or four party colleagues last night and received calls from former ministers," the official said, adding that restrictions on Bhutto might be lifted within a day. Bhutto was sacked on Tuesday for a second time in her turbulent political career by the country's president, who accused her beleaguered government of corruption, nepotism and misrule. There has been no official word on Bhutto's status, but she has not been allowed to leave the prime minister's elegant house on a hill overlooking Islamabad and police guarding the gate turned away many people who tried to visit her on Tuesday. Lawyers for former defence minister Aftab Shaaban Meerani filed a habeas corpus petition in a Rawalpindi court on Tuesday, pleading that she had been "held unlawfully incommunicado". The court set a hearing for Wednesday. "The cabinet, which is meeting at 11.00 a.m. (0600 GMT), may take a decision on her and Zardari today," said the government official, who asked not to be named. He said Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto's husband, had been flown to Rawalpindi, near Islamabad, late on Tuesday from Lahore, where he had been detained soon after President Farooq Leghari dismissed Bhutto's government in the early hours. The official did not say where Zardari was being held, but newspapers said he was in the city's large Adiala jail. It was not clear if any charges had been brought against Zardari, who is at the centre of corruption allegations levelled against Bhutto's government, in which he was investment minister. Zardari has in the past denied any wrongdoing. He has also denied accusations by lawyers for Ghinwa Bhutto, widow of Benazir Bhutto's slain brother Murtaza, that he was part of a conspiracy that resulted in Murtaza's killing by police in Karachi in disputed circumstances on September 20.
ECAT	Low interest rates will help Quebec's economy grow 2.75 percent in 1997 and 3.0 percent in 1998, according to a report by one of Canada's largest banks. "Over the next two years growth will be driven by domestic demand and exports," said the Bank of Montreal in its regional outlook for the French-speaking province. Quebec's GDP growth was 1.0 percent last year. Continued global economic expansion should underpin demand for Quebec's key products, including transportation equipment, machinery and equipment, and base metals, said Tim O'Neill, the bank's chief economist.
GCAT	European Union security officials (corrects from interior ministers) agreed at a secret conference in Paris to study harmonising anti-terrorism laws and speeding up extradition procedures, a French terrorism expert said on Friday. Roland Jacquard, head of the International Observatory of Terrorism, told Reuters that France's Jean-Louis Debre hosted a meeting on October 22. The French Interior Ministry had no immediate comment on the report. "Debre secretly hosted a meeting of European anti-terrorism officials (corrects from ministers), and justice and police representatives from the United States were also present," said Jacquard, who advises French authorities on terrorist threats. He said a working group was set up on harmonising anti-terrorism laws and on speeding up extradition procedures. "The plan is for such conferences to take place every three months," Jacquard said. The October conference followed a Paris meeting held on July 30 which included foreign and security ministers of the Group of Seven most industrialised nations and Russia. They persuaded Washington to dump proposals for sanctions against what it calls "terrorist states", instead working to toughen international standards for detecting bombs and protecting aircraft and other public transport. French President Jacques Chirac has said that talks on security, crime, drugs and money laundering would figure prominently at an EU summit on Friday in Dublin, Ireland. "Bit by bit, we have to move towards harmonising legislations," Chirac said in a television interview on Thursday, adding that concrete measures would be adopted in Dublin. "Because the risk is that a criminal could slip through the net by going from one country to another and by using differences in legislations which make arrest difficult in certain conditions," he said. In Europe, extradition has been a bone of contention between France and other countries as Paris anti-terrorism magistrates investigate a wave of bombings blamed on Algerian Moslem fundamentalists which killed eight people last year. French former interior minister Charles Pasqua has accused Belgium, Germany, and Britain of offering immunity to Islamic guerrilla groups in exchange for promises not to operate on their territories. But Chirac said in ihis interview that police cooperation, especially with Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy, had been significantly reinforced. Debre has discussed harmonising anti-terrorism laws, and easing extradition procedures, at bilateral meetings with his Spanish and Italian counterparts.  REUTER
CCAT	Seven years is a long hangover. But seven years after a 1990 collapse in asset prices saddled Japan's banking system with huge bad loans, many institutions are still struggling to get out from under and have done little to boost their global competitiveness, analysts say. Industry watchers believe authorities will honour their pledge not to let top banks fail, but they also warn that confidence in the ability of bankers and bureaucrats to cure financial system woes is flagging. Bank shares have slumped since late last year on worries about the health of the sector, and those fears grabbed the spotlight again this week after rumours -- flatly denied by the bank -- that Nippon Credit Bank Ltd was on the verge of collapse. Overseas funding costs for Japanese banks, the so-called Japan premium, have meanwhile risen in an echo of concerns in mid-1995, when Hyogo Bank Ltd became Japan's first bank to collapse in five decades. Ironically perhaps, investor patience is waning just as the government touts its commitment to planned five-year "Big Bang" financial reforms that would expose banks to harsher competition. "The perception of most foreigners has been that..the government and the bankers had decided to just wait it out and because that has worked in Japan in the past, I think that investors were also willing to give regulators and bankers the benefit of the doubt," Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia, told Reuters Financial Television. "I think what happened at the end of December was a realisation that very little has happened and very little is likely to happen," Ogawa said. "I suppose there is a beginning of a collapse in confidence in the ability of the private sector and the public sector to put things back together again." Analysts say stronger banks are making progress toward writing off their bad loan burdens, but some weaker brethren are facing difficulties. "The stronger banks are going in the right direction and the problem is basically manageable," said Koyo Ozeki, director of IBCA Ltd in Tokyo. "As regards some of the weaker banks, they have certain difficulties dealing with asset quality problems with their own financial resources in the short-term." Insufficient disclosure of the true state of affairs at individual banks, however, increases market jitters and can make it hard for banks and officials to kill rumours. "You know there are a lot of bad banks out there and you know there are potentially some braindead banks out there, but you don't really know precisely how bad it is and which banks are braindead," said Walter Altherr, senior banking analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities. "Most importantly, you have no idea what the government is going to do, if anything, about that." Analysts expect the government to keep its promise that none of the top 20 banks will be allowed to fail and that creditors and depositors will be protected, but don't know precisely how that pledge will be honoured. "The chance of any failure among any of the banks that are internationally active is absolutely out of the question. But that is not to say that some major banks are not in very serious trouble," Salomon's Ogawa said. "I would argue that one or two are technically insolvent. At the end of the day, something has to be done and that's part of the uncertainty now," she said, adding that one likely scenario was a merger with a stronger "white knight" bank. Handling the problem could also require using taxpayers' money, a political hot potato given public outrage last year over the use of 685 billion yen ($5.52 billion) from the national budget to help wind up failed mortgage firms. What bothers some analysts as much as the lingering bad loan problems of the past, however, is the failure of many Japanese banks to address the challenges of the future. "If you removed all the problem assets tomorrow, what would you be left with?" Ogawa said. "You'd be left with a financial system which is characterised by incredible levels of excess capacity, little or no capacity for innovation, a very low level of respect for shareholders, and low international competitiveness. What's so great about that?"
CCAT	The decision by UK Trade and Industry Secretary Margaret Beckett to block a merger between Bass Plc and brewer Carlsberg-Tetley should favour Scottish & Newcastle, S&N's finance director Derek Wilkinson said on Monday. "We frankly would have lived with either decision but on balance the decision is more favourable to us because it leaves us as number one with the dominant position and a strong brand range," Wilkinson told Reuters. When asked about the company's trading outlook for the coming six months Wilkinson said the group had made an encouraging start to the year after reporting a 21-percent increase in its profits before tax and exceptional items to 374 million pounds in the year to April 27.
CCAT	The Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan (DIC) said on Tuesday that it is planning to set up a group with public and private sector help next month to consider measures to collect problem loans run up by failed "jusen" mortgage firms. "We think securitisation of the problem loans is one effective measure to collect them, but we have just started considering details," a DIC official said. The group could be joined by officials from the finance, construction and justice ministries along with local and foreign securities houses, but no details have been decided yet, he said.
CCAT	About 250 angry investors gathered outside the offices of a local businessman in this former Dutch colony on Thursday after he said he could not pay back money they put into his pyramid saving scheme. Police held back the crowd amid fears that the crisis over get-rich-quick schemes could become violent. Local economists say the saving schemes -- which rely on ever increasing numbers of depositors to pay off old investors -- contain at least half the amount of savings in commercial banks and that many investors have borrowed heavily to take advantage of the 120 percent annual interest rates on offer. Local banks offer rates of less than 20 percent per year. One man brandishing a wooden stick was thrown out of the building of Roepsingh Ramtahalsingh's NV Roep. "If I don't get my money back within three weeks, I'll blow up the place," another man in his 30s, dressed in T-shirt and jeans said. Thursday's events were the first sign of violence in a crisis which has been brewing for more than two months. Roep began to run into difficulties in April when the collapse of similar savings schemes in Albania led to mass rioting and focused attention on pyramid banking. The flow of new investors dried up and Roep said he could no longer pay interest. Roep has now asked for between one and three years to pay back savings as he sells off his other businesses. Investors said on Thursday they would form an action group to force Roep to pay and asked the government to intervene. "It's time the government did something," one elderly man said. "They should lock Roep up because he's a thief." Government officials in the South American country of 430,000 people have made no comment on the crisis, which local economists have called a timebomb, other than a vague commitment to protect small investors.
ECAT	Israel's November consumer price index (CPI), due to published on Sunday, will show a rise of 0.4-0.6, economists predicted on Thursday. If inflation is 0.5 percent, the year-on-year inflation rate will be 10.9 percent (corrects from 9.6 percent). "By itself, the November inflation rate is within the government's target," said Shauli Katznelson, chief economist at Israel Discount Bank. But, he added, the shekel's weakening against the dollar in recent weeks will feed into higher consumer prices in the next two months. "The situation in November doesn't reflect what the indices will be in December and January," Katznelson said. Irit Oren, economist at the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce, said the Federation was expecting a lower CPI figure of no more than 0.4-0.5 percent. She said the major factor was housing prices. She predicted they would show a rise of no more than 0.5 percent in November. Home prices are customarily denominated in dollars and therefore rise when the dollar strengthens. But this factor has been offset by the weakness of the property market, Oren said. She added that the Federation expected housing prices to continue cooling inflation over the near term. As a result, the Federation is expecting continued low indices over the next few months. Discount, on the other hand, is expecting the CPI to show a relatively high 10 to 11 percent increase in the coming 12 months. Nevertheless, Katznelson said he expected that the Bank of Israel would lower the short-term interest rate at the end of December from the current 15.2 percent. Many analysts have said the central bank will not cut rates until the debate now going on in parliament over the 1997 budget is over. Parliament is expected to vote on the budget by December 31, a week after the Bank of Israel announces its monthly monetary programme. But Katznelson said the central bank would not wait. "Without relating to the budget, there is room to cut interest rates this month 0.5 percentage point," he said. Real interest rates are now six percent or more, which Katznelson said was "unreasonable" in a slowing economy. "I think that in a situation like this, you can't have a real rate of interest like you had this year in an overheated economy," he said. Katznelson said that over the next three months the central bank to lower rates a total of 1.2 percent point. - David Rosenberg, Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
GCAT	U.S. special envoy Bill Richardson will fly to Paris on Wednesday to consult with France about the "endgame" in Zaire, as rebel forces approach the capital Kinshasa, a State Department spokesman said on Tuesday. Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has been shuttling between the Zaire factions and neighbouring countries trying to avert a bloody end to the Zaire conflict. He was in South Africa on Tuesday for talks with Vice President Thabo Mbeki. "We want to make sure we're coordinating with the French during the endgame in Zaire," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told Reuters. "It's only a matter of time. The writing's on the wall," said Burns, who was accompanying Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on a trip to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. The rebel forces of Laurent Kabila say they are less than 50 miles (85 km) from Kinshasa and have appealed for government troops to surrender to avoid a bloody takeover of the capital. Diplomatic sources say the front line is more like 125 miles (200 km) from Kinshasa. Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko, whose resignation the rebels have demanded, will travel to Gabon for an African mini summit on Wednesday but a spokesman said he would return to his capital two days later. U.S. officials say their differences with France over Zaire have narrowed in recent weeks as Paris has moved away from its long-standing support for Mobutu. Despite seizing the diplomatic initiative by sending Richardson to Zaire, Washington has appeared anxious to pay homage to France's traditional role in the region. France on Tuesday expressed deep concern over rebel threats to take Kinshasa by force if necessary and renewed its appeals for a peaceful transition.
MCAT	KCBT hard red winter wheat futures closed higher, boosted partly by bullish sentiment on charts and stronger than expected weekly U.S. export sales, dealers said. "Technical trade ruled the roost," one dealer said. They noted that the market had broken out of its recent trading range on the key September contract, with the day's peak of $3.79 a bushel the highest level since June 13. September ended up three cents at $3.76 a bushel. The close was seen as technically constructive as it was above Wednesday's high of $3.74 and previous resistance at $3.75. Other months finished 3-1/4 to 2-3/4 cents higher. Dealers said there was heavy fund buying with E.D. and F. Man buying 3.0 million bushels September and 1.0 million December and Rosenthal Collins 3.5 million September. They also noted Wolcott bought 1.0 million bushels September and 2.0 million December. Other supportive factors included slightly stronger than expected U.S. weekly net export sales of 765,100 tonnes, above a forecast range of 650,000 to 750,000. The Canadian Wheat Board also put Western Canadian production at a lower than expected 21.6 million tonnes. Last year Western Canada produced 29.5 million tonnes. Volume was estimated at 48.2 million bushels, up from 31.8 million on Wednesday. ((-Nigel Hunt 312-408 8720))
ECAT	A two percent cut in South Africa's prime rate was possible in 1997 owing to an expected improvement in the country's export performance, the University of Stellenbosch's Bureau for Economic Research said on Friday. In its last economic review for 1996, the BER said that the recent sharp depreciation of the rand should increase the competitiveness of South African exports. The overseas economic upswing was likely to strengthen further and this was seen am additional boost to exports over the next six to 12 months. "Imports, on the other hand, are likely to be constrained by weaker domestic demand and the rising costs of imports related to the depreciation of the rand," BER said. All this should result in a meaningful reduction in the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, which in turn should make for easier money market conditions, it said. As a result, the pressure on interest rates would be downward and BER believed that a two percent reduction in the prime rate next year was a distinct possibility. "This view could of course be negated should government decide to follow a 'big bang' approach to the removal of exchange control. "Under such a scenario, the prime rate could increase sharply, by perhaps three to five percent in the short term." However, the BER said the government was unlikely to adopt such an approach in view of its often publicly stated desire to adopt a gradual abolition approach. The BER said that it was a matter of concern that net capital inflows from abroad had failed to adequately materialise in order to finance the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. "In view of the precariously low level of South African gold and foreign reserves, the failure of imports to moderate significantly further and/or exports to accelerate in the next six months or so, will invariably necessitate a continued restrictive monetary policy stance in the short term." -- Cape Town newsroom +27 21 25-2238
CCAT	Rent-Way Inc said Friday it had signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire 70 rental-purchase stores for $23 million.   The company, which did not give further details of the purchase, said the stores were located in Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia and owned by the Rental-King chain. Annual revenues for 62 of the 70 stores total about $24 million, it said. "With the completion of this acquisition, Rent-Way will (have) ...193 stores and revenues at a twelve month running rate approaching $100 million," it said. The deal is set to close in early February, it added. Rent-Way said the deal was its second acquisition in 1997. Assuming completion of the acquisition, the company will have grown from just 19 stores with annual revenues of $8 million when it had its public offering in 1993, to 193 stores with monthly revenues of about $8 million, it said. Rent-Way currently operates a chain of 123 rental-purchase stores, renting brand name durable household products such as furniture and major appliances.
CCAT	Nomura Securities Co Ltd said on Monday that it had downgraded Yamazaki Baking Co Ltd to a "2" rating from its previous "1". In its three-grade rating system, Nomura assigns a "2" rating to issues whose values it sees moving within 10 percentage points in either direction of the key 225-share Nikkei average over the following six months.
ECAT	Finance Minister Bill Birch said on Friday the government's growth forecasts released in Thursday's Budget were not too optimistic, after the release of lower expectations by the Reserve Bank. Treasury projected growth of 2.4 percent in the 1997/98 year and 4.2 percent in 1998/99 before seeing it ease to 3.5 percent in 1999/2000. "That is not overly optimistic," Birch said in a speech to a business lunch meeting.   "By 1998-9 the key factors all work in one direction -- to improve the rate of growth," Birch said. He noted the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research had estimated growth of 4.3 percent for that year. "The Reserve Bank in its release this morning forecasts growth of between 3.5 percent and 4.0 percent in 1998/99 and 1999/2000," Birch said, without commenting further. On Friday the Reserve Bank released its projections showing growth of 2.0 percent in 1997/98, 3.6 percent in 1998/99 and 3.8 percent in 1999/2000.   "Lower interest rates, a more stable exchange rate, a positive low-inflation outlook, more government spending, further tax cuts in July 1998 and a strong world economy will work to improve business conditions," Birch said. He said the 4.2 percent growth rate predicted by Treasury for the 1998/99 year was in line with world average growth levels. Birch said the rebound would start later this year kick- started by previous interest rates cuts which had fallen three percentage points since October.   Birch reiterated the government had committed NZ$3.3 billion of the coalition government's planned $5 billion in spending over the next three years, but more than $1 billion of the committed funds have been held in contingency. "Some of that billion dollars is there to cover a negotiated settlement of a future unified pay scale for teachers. Some of it covers area of policy still being crystallized," Birch said. The centre right coalition government tabled its first Budget on Thursday, outlining a planned surplus of $1.5 billion and $900 million of extra spending in the 1997/98 year. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 473 4746
CCAT	Australian geotechnical survey specialist Aerodata Holdings said on Tuesday it was prepared to offer 55p per share to shareholders in British oil services company Scott Pickford Plc if it could agree terms. Aerodata already has a cross-shareholding arrangement with Scott Pickford, and planned to extend this to an operational collaboration over time, but saw its plans thrown into jeopardy by a recent full takeover bid for Scott Pickford launched by U.S. company Core Laboratories NV.   Aerodata said in its statement it was in talks with Scott Pickford "with a view to formalising an offer valued at 55p per share", but such an offer would be subject to the board of Scott Pickford recommending it at that price level. Earlier this month Core made a cash offer at 53p, valuing the British company at about 6.7 million pounds, and Aerodata's initial response was to say it would be prepared to match this. However, Core then raised by 4p to 57p on the condition that a planned share exchange betweeen Scott and Aerodata be stopped. At the centre of the triangle, Scott has declined to make a decisive move in either direction so far and has continued to recommend its shareholders to take no action. In its Tuesday statement, Aerodata also said it wished to take issue with Core's reporting of bid acceptances. On Monday Core said it had won acceptances totalling 47.56 percent of Scott's shares, comprising 14.99 percent who had accepted the 53p bid and another 32.57 percent who had signed up for the conditional 57p offer. Aerodata, which has begun a legal challenge to enforce its share exchange plan, said that Core could only claim to have 14.99 percent as irrevocable acceptances, and called the remainder "imply non-legally binding statements of intent". -- Andrew Huddart, London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7717
CCAT	Shares in French foods group Danone fell on Friday as analysts drew adverse comparisons with Swiss giant Nestle, which reported strong first-half profits, and Dutch brewer Heineken, which warned of flat beer sales in Europe. One analyst said: "Some say Danone is undervalued. When you look at the Nestle figures, you can understand why." The Swiss company posted first half profit of 1.35 billion Swiss francs. Danone shares traded down 12 francs at 726, or 1.63 percent, at 1115 GMT, while the market was down 0.13 percent. Heineken's beer sales forecast also undermined the stock.   The Dutch brewer posted first-half profit up six percent to 297 million guilders and warned of a slightly lower profit for the 1996 full year compared to 1995's 664 million. Heineken's chairman said the company could not guarantee double-digit profit growth in the next three years. French analysts said Danone makes 10 percent of turnover from beer sales and the results would reflect any weakness in the market. -- Paris newsroom +33 1 4221 5452 wem/pnt
CCAT	Hungarian trading company Csopak Szovetkezeti Rt will pay a 10 percent dividend on 1996 earnings as against eight percent the previous year, following shareholders' approval on Saturday. Dividend payments will start on May 20. In 1996 the group posted a consolidated after-tax profit of 260.9 millon forints on net sales of 8.61 billion. Csopak CEO Gyorgy Markovszky told the annual general meeting Csopak planned a consolidated pre-tax profit of 980.8 million forints on sales of 18.75 billion for 1997, and saw an extraordinary net income of 427 million from real estate sales. He said Csopak would like to spend 250 million forints on dividends on the 1997 earnings. In an interview with Reuters earlier this month Markovszky said Csopak was going ahead with its plans to become an increasingly trading-oriented group, founded on hopes of a recovery in domestic consumption, giving up its classic role as a holding company. He also said, however, that Csopak's plans for 1997 include the consolidation of earlier acquisitions rather than going ahead with new ones. Csopak is 32 percent owned by the U.K-based East European Food Fund which acquired its stake via a private placement last December while the state-owned Hungarian Development Bank (MFB Rt) has 21 percent. On Saturday, the AGM approved the consolidation into Csopak of its four wholly-owned subsidiaries, Forum Rt, Pannoncoop Rt, Veszpa Kft and Chance-96 Kft. These mergers will leave Csopak's issued share capital unchanged. However a share swap, under which local government shareholders of household chemicals trading subsidiary Komfort Rt will receive one Csopak share for each Komfort they hold, will raise Csopak's capital by 250 million forints to 2.45 billion. The company informed its shareholders that it would apply for the requalification of its shares to the listed "A" category of the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) from listed "B". Among other differences, the "A" category carries stricter obligations on providing information. -- Emese Bartha, Budapest newsroom +36 1 327-4040

CCAT	Deutsche Lufthansa AG will seek to reduce its unit costs by 20 percent by transferring some of its work, such as administration, to countries outside Germany, Chairman Juergen Weber told a freight managers convention. The airline is seeking savings of more than 1 billion marks ($656 million) in passenger operations by the year 2001, Weber said in a speech to the annual congress of the Germany Shippers Association (BVL) in Berlin. This included the transfer of work to countries where equal competence and high quality standards exist at a fraction of the cost in Germany, such as the relocation of ticket billing to India, he said. "The improvement of the costs side remains a permanent task of the management since our competitors are also following this path strongly," he said.
MCAT	Tokyo stocks ended sharply lower on Wednesday with most of the market preoccupied with the debut of Tokyo Disneyland operator Oriental Land Co Ltd, brokers said. Futures-linked sales especially helped drag the benchmark down in the afternoon session, they added. The Nikkei 225 closed 253.74 points or 1.22 percent lower at 20,568.38. Its December futures were down 220 points at 20,570 by the day's end. "Interest in Oriental Land steered the whole market," Yasuo Ueki, Nikko Securities general manager said. "Once trade started to wane, the entire market slowed down."   Oriental Land shares finished at 8,800 yen on the first day of trade, compared to the initial offer price of 8,050 yen. The first trade was done at 8,850 yen and the shares rose briefly to 9,030 yen in the morning before falling back. It was the most heavily traded issue on the first section of the Tokyo bourse on turnover of about 8.46 million shares. "There were hopes that trade in Oriental Land would boom as in the case of Nippon Broadcasting System Inc, which debuted last week, but it didn't, and some investors were disappointed," one foreign broker said.   Brokers said that bouts of weakness in futures sent the benchmark trickling to as low as 20,466.66 late in the day, but they added the weakness was natural after two days of hefty rises. Turnover was 321 million compared to 337 million on Tuesday, with decliners swamping advancers 795 issues to 257 issues, while 179 were unchanged. In other indices, TOPIX was down 18.09 points or 1.17 percent at 1,524.90. The Nikkei 300 fell 3.68 points, or 1.26 percent to 288.70. The second section index was down 6.09 points, or 0.31 percent at 1,931.15.
GCAT	French Prime Minister Alain Juppe won backing from Corsican deputies on Wednesday for a crackdown on separatist violence as guerrillas blamed for bombings on the Mediterranean island accused him of burying a peace process. Several of the seven deputies and senators said after they met Juppe that they supported his "policy of firmly maintaining republican law" on the French island, hit by a wave of bombings targeting public buildings and magistrates. "I'm an opposition parliamentarian, I express some differences on social and economic policy, but on the need to re-establish the rule of law, I support him totally," Radical Socialist deputy Emile Zuccarelli told reporters. Parliament member and former industry minister Jose Rossi urged the French National Assembly to set up a parliamentary mission on Corsica. Juppe's office said in a statement that the premier, flanked by five cabinet ministers, had detailed his law and order policy and his plan for tax breaks to boost Corsica's ailing economy. French media said security was tightened at public buildings in Paris, with some police wearing bullet-proof vests, after suspected Corsican separatists made telephone threats of machinegun attacks. Police declined comment. In an earlier statement, Corsica's outlawed separatist FLNC movement accused the government of wrecking a peace process. The Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) Historic Wing accused Paris of "willingly letting the situation rot to bring the Corsican question back to a simple law and order issue". "The government has chosen provocation," it said. The movement seeks greater autonomy from the mainland and called off a shaky truce in mid-August. It urged its militants "to signal everywhere their determination to survive and for emancipation". "Juppe's move, signalled by the round-up of Ajaccio (suspects), seals the liquidation by the state of the peace process," it said, referring to the seizure of six suspected guerrillas put under investigation by a Paris anti-terrorism judge. In the island's capital Ajaccio, some 100 demonstrators occupied the chamber of the Corsican assembly on Wednesday, demanding talks with a representative of Juppe, and recognition of the Corsican people. A spokesman for the protesters, chiefly workers from the tourism, transport, fishing and farming sectors, said they would continue the occupation until their demand had been met.

GCAT	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Monday the United States would accept the verdict of Mexican voters who dealt their country's ruling party its worst setback in seven decades in power. Early results in Sunday's elections showed that President Ernesto Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) lost its 68-year grip on the lower house of Congress, and was also trounced in the first race for Mexico City mayor this century. "I think that the issue here is one in which we will obviously accept the verdict of the people of Mexico," said Albright, visiting Madrid for a NATO summit on Tuesday. "It is our custom that we respect the votes of the people in countries where they elect their legislatures or their presidents," Albright told a news conference after talks with Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes. "We also have quite a lot of experience in dealing with countries where there is divided government, including our own," she added drily. Zedillo, whose policies have been heavily backed by the United States despite major economic and drug problems in Mexico, was not up for re-election.

GCAT	Scotland host Ireland at Murrayfield on Saturday in a Five Nations rugby union clash that has pride - and British Lions places - at stake. While England and France clash in a probable championship decider at Twickenham, the Edinburgh match is likely to decide only who finishes in last place. Both sides go into the game on the back of record thrashings by England. The Scots have also lost on home soil to Wales while Ireland were beaten by France but scraped past Wales in Cardiff. Both coaches will look back to the first hour of their respective games against England when their charges were still in contention - and both will hope to avoid the late collapses that saw the points against column click into the 40s. Scotland have switched Gregor Townsend back to centre and look to stiffen up the midfield with the introduction of former rugby leaguer Alan Tait. Tait won eight Scottish caps in the late 1980s before spending a decade in the 13-man code and the selectors are hoping his professionalism will ensure the Scots do not again wilt in the latter stages. Townsend, Scotland's most creative player, has been bouncing from fly-half to centre for some time and will hope his link with the strong-running Tait will punch through the Irish line. The move allows the return of Craig Chalmers to the number 10 jersey and sees Tony Stanger moving from centre to the right wing. Skipper Rob Wainwright switches to blindside flanker, with Peter Walton taking over the number eight duties. Ireland will look to start with their usual intensity, but must find a way of keeping some control in the second half. The victory over Wales came only after a desperate reargaurd action and the selectors have looked to New Zealand for discipline. Murray Kidd may have moved on but the Kiwi connection is still strong in the shape of hooker Ross Nesdale and centre Kurt McQuilken. Coach Brian Ashton, who on Thursday committed himself to Ireland until 2003, had gone for Brian O'Meara instead of Niall Hogan at scrum half but injuries have hit his plans hard. Missing are Eric Elwood, stalwart prop Nick Popplewell, winger James Topping and in-form number eight Eric Miller. Scotland's Peter Walton said his Newcastle clubmate Poppelwell has been playing well this season and will be "a big miss for Ireland". Ireland have not won in Edinburgh since 1983 and it is nine years since their last home success against the Scots. But Ashton insisted on Thursday: "We are confident and this is by no means a second division game." While both teams will be trying hard to avoid a potential last place in the championship, another motivating factor for several players on view is a possible place in the British Lions squad to tour to South Africa. All 30 are well versed in doughty defence in the face of sustained pressure - just the thing Fran Cotton's men may need in the summer.
ECAT	China will boost supervision of foreign currency payments on imports to try to stop the flow of foreign exchange from the current account to the capital account, the Xinhua news agency said on Monday. Under the new rules, effective March 1, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange will take over from designated state banks verification of foreign exchange payments on imports, Xinhua quoted administration director Zhou Xiaochuan, as saying. Zhou said the regulations would help ensure authenticity of payments and help iron out problems encountered in making the yuan convertible under the current account. China made the yuan convertible under the current account on December 1. "The new law will standardise the payments for imports by importers and the designated banks, and it will also prevent the transfer of foreign exchange from the current account to the capital account," Zhou said. He said such transfers could disturb the financial market, but did not elaborate. But he said the rules would have a postive effect on the foreign trade sector. He expected imports and exports this year to be basically balanced, and the yuan to remain stable. Zhou said China will launch this year a comprehensive statistical study of international incomes and payments and try to strengthen regulation of foreign exchange supply and demand under the capital account. Beijing also aimed to standardise and develop the interbank foreign exchange market and maintain a stable foreign exchange market, he said. ($1 = 8.3 yuan) -- Beijing Newsroom (8610) 6532-1921
ECAT	Ivory Coast's Finance Minister Ngoran Niamien said in an interview published on Wednesday that his government and banks had failed to reach common ground in latest talks on rescheduling the country's $6 billion trade debt.   "The banks and ourselves have reached discord," Niamen told official daily Fraternite Matin, adding that the negotiations had been suspended until November. "The banks are demanding a restructuring which is vastly beyond our capacity to pay and we cannot accept that," he added. He gave no details of proposals by the London Club of creditor banks whose negotiators met the Ivorians in Washington last week on the sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual gathering.   An official source told Reuters in July that Ivory Coast had offered at talks in Paris in June to pay 128 billion CFA in 1996 and about 11 billion CFA yearly up to 2000. Its package works out to an average yearly repayment of 21.7 billion CFA between 1997 and 2010. In January banks had demanded 161 billion CFA for 1996 and an average of 148 billion CFA between 1997 and 2010. "Our capacity to pay has has been greatly reduced because, on top of the commercial bank debt, we have multilateral debts with the Paris Club (of official creditors), we have also internal debt," Niamen said. He said Ivory Coast's capacity to pay had not improved simply because it had good prospects of attracting foreign investors or because of the discovery of some oil in its offshore fields. This was only a gamble on the future. Ivory Coast has said it is a victim of its own economic succees: creditors think it can repay debts at any cost simply because of a rebound in its economy. "But I think that if we do not resolve the (debt) problem all our effort shall be in vain...If the debt problem is resolved, that will boost our investment promotion efforts, both as regards foreign investors as well as local," he said.

GCAT	The United States has recalled its ambassador to Belarus for consultations and will soon announce further steps to protest the expulsion of a U.S. diplomat, the State Department said on Tuesday. Spokesman John Dinger said ambassador Kenneth Yalowitz would arrive in Washington Thursday to report to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. U.S. relations with Belarus have worsened sharply in recent weeks. Last week Washington said it had cut off $40 million in aid to the former Soviet Republic of 10 million people because of its human rights record. The latest flareup began when authorities in Minsk arrested U.S. first secretary Serzh Alexandrov, of Belarussian origin, at an opposition rally protesting against the pro-Moscow policies of hardline President Alexander Lukashenko. About 70 other people were arrested during the rally which erupted in clashes on Sunday. Alexandrov was detained several hours and told to leave within 24 hours. Belarus accused him of "provocative" actions. The embassy said he was carrying out his normal diplomatic duties. "We have recalled our ambassador from Minsk. He is expected to arrive back in Washington on Thursday for consulations," Dinger said. "Beyond that, there will be an appropriate response to the expulsion of Mr. Alexandrov which we hope to announce soon and we are still considering the full range of possibilities." He said the expulsion of Alexandrov was just the latest in a series of actions by Belarus against U.S. citizens. The United States has been a vociferous opponent of Lukashenko's increasingly authoritarian rule.

GCAT	By Gail Appleson, U.S. Law Correspondent A federal jury convicted a young woman on Friday of trying to extort $40 million from actor Bill Cosby by threatening to sell a story claiming that she is his illegitimate daughter. Autumn Jackson, 22, was charged with threatening to ruin Cosby's reputation by offering to sell her story to the Globe supermarket tabloid if she did not receive money from him. Jackson put her head in her hands and began sobbing uncontrollably upon hearing the verdict from the Manhattan federal jury, which had been deliberating since Wednesday. She will be sentenced on Oct. 22. "She is absolutely devastated," Robert Baum, Jackson's lawyer told reporters. "She was inconsolable. She kept saying 'How could they? How could they?'" Mary Jo White, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that Jackson and two others had carried out a "bold and deliberate" scheme to threaten the reputation of one of America's best-loved entertainers. "No one, no matter what their perceived relationship to the victim might be, has the right to subject that person to extortionate demands," White said. Baum said he would appeal the verdict and would seek a lighter sentence than the five-year minimum suggested by court guidelines. Baum said that if the judge granted his request, Jackson might be able to avoid a jail term. The maximum sentence for the crimes of which she was convicted is 12 years. "As far as we're concerned the case is not over," he said. Jackson was on trial with Jose Medina, 51, and Boris Sabas, 42. They were charged with conspiracy, extortion and crossing state lines to commit crimes. The indictment charges that the scheme began in late December and lasted until Jan. 18. Jackson and Medina were arrested just two days after Cosby's only son was shot to death in Los Angeles.  Federal prosecutors have said there was no evidence the scheme was connected to the Jan. 16 murder. Medina was also convicted on all counts, while Sabas was found guilty of all but the extortion charge. District Judge Barbara Jones had instructed the jury that Cosby's paternity was irrelevant in the case and that the real issue was whether the defendants committed extortion. Cosby testified he had sex once with Jackson's mother, Shawn Thompson, but denied being her father. Members of the jury, made up of seven men and five women, told reporters after the verdict the evidence against the defendants was overwhelming and they did not consider paternity in their decision. "Nobody has the right to extort money from their father," said Deborah Hyman, one of the jurors. Baum said that Jackson may decide to file a paternity suit against Cosby after her sentencing. He argued that Jackson believed she was Cosby's daughter and had a right to the actor's financial support. He said she felt she was negotiating a final settlement of those funds. "I can't imagine a father would feel good seeing his daughter go to jail," he told reporters. Cosby did not comment on the verdict but his lawyer, Jack Schmitt, said, "The Cosbys appreciate the efforts of the prosecutors who brought this case and the efforts of the jurors who rendered a just verdict." During the trial, prosecutors had introduced as evidence letters addressed to President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Cosby's publisher, CBS and Cosby's television sponsors. In some letters she threatened to expose the actor as a deadbeat dad unless she received money. She described herself as destitute and living in a car in some versions. At the same time, however, she and her fiance were looking at expensive Los Angeles real estate including a 34-acre (13.7 hectare) piece of property priced at $1.25 million. The owner of the property testified that the couple said they were about to come into a lot of money. As part of the scheme, Jackson gave Cosby's lawyer and the then CBS president copies of an unsigned contract with the Globe tabloid in which she would sell her story for $25,000.

MCAT	Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Monday. LONDON - British shares struggled higher in a sluggish day's trade but ended well short of last week's highs as another strong performance on Wall Street failed to shake off London's post-holiday torpor. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks ended just short of the day's best levels, up 17.0 points at 4,106.5. FRANKFURT - German shares closed bourse trade off day-highs but firmer following the stronger dollar and Friday's 1.58 percent gain on Wall Street. The DAX-30 index of leading German shares closed 22.04 points up at 2,881.32, after earlier hitting a session high of 2,899.40. In post-bourse trade the DAX index was up 26.94 to 2,890.20. PARIS - French shares closed on a strong note as gains on Wall Street boosted the CAC-40 index. Dollar strength, which helps investment inflows, and hopes of continued French interest rate cuts supported the Paris market. But recent sharp swings on the Dow also induced a note of caution. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 23.91 points or 1.05 percent at 2,306.67. ZURICH - Swiss shares ended weaker in a market that favoured industrial shares but was negative toward banks and insurers. The broad SPI fell 5.92 points to 2,506.22 and the blue-chip SMI was down 16.3 to 3,923.8. TOKYO - Tokyo stocks closed the first trading day of the year modestly higher as selective buying of shares in blue-chip companies helped the market, which was still suffering from an uncertain outlook for the economy. The benchmark Nikkei 225 average finished up 84.65 points or 0.44 percent at 19,446.00. HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks climbed 1.67 percent to a much higher close, lifted by positive sentiment surrounding the property and finance sectors and underpinned by a rebound on Wall Street. The Hang Seng Index jumped 221.14 points to end at the day high of 13,443.93. SYDNEY - The Australian share market ended with modest gains with a rebounding Wall Street providing the inspiration, Early strength was sapped, however, by a gold sector that dived 1.6 percent after the bullion price tumbled offshore. The All Ordinaries index added 10.3 points to 2,409.8. JOHANNESBURG - South African gold stocks felt the brunt of a weak bullion price which sank to its lowest level in over three years. Almost 2.5 percent was shaved off the value of the gold index, with dealers predicting further downside for the metal and shares on Tuesday. The gold index fell 2.48 percent or 36.2 points to 1,421.8 -- its lowest level in a year. Dealers said there was, however, no heavy sell-off of gold shares. Share weakness was also capped by the rand which spent most of the day holding weaker against the dollar above the 4.70 level. Industrial shares ended a touch firmer, gaining 6.0 points to 7,882.5. The all-share index fell 21.3 points to 6,576.2.
CCAT	India's largest steelmaker said on Monday it was exploring buying a stake in an Australian coal mine in what analysts said was an unusually bold foray by a state-owned firm. The state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) said it had begun talks with the British Coal Corporation to buy the British firm's 14.8 percent stake in Australia's German Creek Mine. "We are talking to them," a SAIL spokesman told Reuters by telephone. "They have given us some rather sketchy information. We have asked for more." A British Coal spokeswoman told Reuters in London: "British Coal is in the process of disposing all of its remaining interests. At the appropriate time this will include the German Creek joint venture. "But currently British Coal is not in negotiations with any organisation on the sale of its interest. However, the corporation keeps in touch with potential purchasers with a view to judging the right time to proceed with a disposal." She gave no further details. The SAIL spokesman said the preliminary talks could help SAIL enter a long-term arrangement to meet the coal needs of its steel plants. "I am not aware of any such situation or experience by other public sector companies," said Shashank Bhide of the National Council of Applied Economic Research. "But given the large size of SAIL they probably would be in a position to enter into this kind of an arrangement. If there is sufficient autonomy for companies they will do this and it makes sense," he told Reuters. Another SAIL official, who did not want to be identified, said the steelmaker needed to ensure a steady supply of good quality coal and faced sourcing problems with state-run Coal India Ltd (CIL). "We require about 15 million tonnes of coal (every year), and we get nine from CIL and the balance from Australia and New Zealand," the official said. On CIL's coal, he said: "We are having a lot of problems. Not only in pricing but also in ash content." SAIL officials say a high ash content adversely affects the efficiency of steel plants, and the company needed to look for international alternatives to improve its functioning as it had plans to emerge as a major global player. SAIL, state-run power plants and the Indian railways are among the biggest users of coal in India. India is expected to produce 300 million tonnes of coal in 1996/97 (April-March). It produced 270.45 million tonnes in 1995/96. SAIL reported a net profit of 12.22 billion rupees ($341.3 million) in 1995/96 after 11.29 billion rupees in 1994/95, producing 10.54 million tonnes of crude steel and 9.45 million tonnes of saleable steel after 10.3 million tonnes of crude steel and 9.1 million tonnes of saleable steel in 1994/95.

In August, the last month for which official figures are available, new foreign investment flows excluding the oil industry totalled $86 million, 18 percent less than in the same month last year, Coinvertir said. It said the manufacturing and industrial sector had attracted most new foreign investment so far this year, accounting for 43 percent of the total. Central America and the Caribbean were the source of most new investment entering Colombia between January and August, with 45 percent of the total, acording to Coinvertir. It added that new foreign portfolio investment in the country totalled $177 million between January and August, a 16 percent decline from new portfolio investment in January-August 1995. -- Javier Mozzo, Bogota newsroom, 571 610 7944

GCAT	Director, Regional Specialists Unit, RFE/RL Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) chairman Milos Zeman sees the decisive victory of the Labour Party in Great Britain as a sign of things to come not only in other West European countries, such as Germany, but also in the Czech Republic. Zeman's forecast, however, is problematic for a number of reasons -- the chief one being that Zeman is no Tony Blair. In fact, the CSSD chairman resembles much more Neil Kinnock, whose politicial style, one can argue, was among the causes of Labour's past electoral failures. The Czech Republic is a country ripe for political change. The right-of-centre government was for months unable to address mounting economic problems and proliferating cases of fraud in the banking sector and investment funds. It waited until mid-April to come up with a package of measures aimed at correcting the negative developments. But it failed to identify and replace government members responsible for troubled sectors. As a result, the package is not likely to generate fresh political dynamism. Opinion polls show that only about one quarter of Czechs are satisfied with the political process in the country; and only some 45 percent trust the government. Observers may be right when they describe the coalition government as tired and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus himself as exhausted and devoid of new ideas. It would seem that under such circumstances Zeman's CSSD is a natural replacement for Klaus's coalition. And indeed, had Zeman followed the example of Tony Blair, he could now be close to assuming power. But Zeman's combative style, a lack of tolerance for opponents within his party, and attempts to court voters of extremist parties have made him and his party difficult to accept for many Czech voters. Just as happened in Britain, the  political battle in the Czech Republic between the CSSD and the coalition should focus on centrist voters. But, instead of trying to appeal to such voters with a moderate approach and centre-left policies, Zeman has scared many of them away with his radicalism. As a result, many Czech voters feel they currently do not have an alternative. They find it difficult to continue actively supporting the coalition parties but, at the same time, cannot in clear conscience support the CSSD. In other words, Zeman is too unpredictable. His virulent attacks on the ruling coalition are rarely accompanied by offering alternative economic and political ideas. Moreover, the CSSD's policies make it difficult for Josef Lux's Christian Democratic Union (KDU-CSL) -- a member of Klaus's coalition -- to accept the CSSD as a potential ally. Without the KDU-CSL, however, Zeman cannot hope to form a government. Zeman anticipates a crisis of major proportions -- one that would radicalise the centrist voters to the point where even a more radical CSSD would become acceptable to them. However, no such crisis seems to be in the offing. The Czech economy is, despite all its problems, still doing fairly well. In a comparative perspective, it still easily outperforms most other East European economies. The coalition's main problem is not a real (or potential) economic crisis. Rather, its main problem is that it procrastinated for too long with introducing corrective measures to its otherwise successful reforms as well as with putting more emphasis on the rule of law. It is likely that austerity measures that are part of the government's package will further alienate some social groups. And it is likely that the already besieged government will come under pressure from such groups. Its ability to withstand such pressure is relatively low. However, in order to be able to take over governing, the CSSD would need to trigger early elections in which it would win as decisively as Tony Blair's Labour Party in Britain. Alternativley, it would need a modest victory accompanied by the willingness of the KDU-CSL to become the CSSD's coalition partner. What Zeman refuses to see is that centrist voters in Britain embraced Labour partly because they had lost their fear that Labour would start a process of radical changes. Czech voters do not have the same confidence in Zeman's CSSD, despite the fact that, just as British voters did before their elections, more and more people want a change. When President Vaclav Havel recently said the public was in a "foul mood," he was, as usual, right. One reason for such a state of affairs is that most of those Czech voters who describe themselves as centrist (now the largest group of voters) have almost no alternatives. They realise that economic and political reforms started seven years ago need corrections. And they no longer trust the ruling coalition. But Zeman's radical rhetoric makes them feel that the CSSD may want more than just "corrections." True, the examples of socialist parties that took over governing in Poland and Hungary show that radical preelection rhetoric often differs from such parties' concrete policies after the elections. However, the critical mass of Czech voters seem to believe that Zeman, unlike Aleksandr Kwasniewski or Gyula Horn, may be as radical and unpredictable when in power as he is now.

GCAT	Russian President Boris Yeltsin will make an official visit to Rome early next year, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Friday. Prodi told reporters after meeting the Russian President that he would visit Moscow in September and Yeltsin would make a return visit to Rome in January or February next year. "Yeltsin will come to Rome between January 15 and February 15," Prodi said The two leaders met ahead of a summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations. Prodi said the visits would give new impetus to relations between Russia and Italy, which he said were "very, very good but not wide ranging enough." He said he had raised the possibility of encouraging smaller Italian companies to develop business interests in Russia and that there was also scope to step up imports of Russian energy products into Italy.

CCAT	SembCorp Ltd's plans to build a 600-megawatt power plant in Singapore through joint venture Sembawang Utilities and Terminals Pte Ltd (SUT) are expected to be finalised this year, company officials said on Monday. SUT is building a Singapore $250 million utilities centre on Pulau Sakra, one of seven islands to be merged to form Jurong island for the site of a large petrochemical centre. "SUT still intends to build a cogeneration plant with 600 megawatt power generating capacity for the phase two of the utilities centre development," said Tan Mong Seng, chairman and president of SembEC.   "We hope to make a decision within this year," Tan said. Industry sources said the company was talking to Indonesia and Malaysia for possible natural gas supplies. SUT is a joint venture between SembCorp's engineering and construction unit, SembEC, Belgium's Powerfin S.A., JTC International Pte Ltd and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. Tan said SUT was awaiting details of the Singapore government's plans to deregulate the power supply market in 1998. The government is expected to make an announcement this year.   SUT has been in negotitations with the Public Utilities Board as well as PowerGrid, the Singapore Power subsidiary which will manage electricity distribution, on the cogeneration plant's potential supplies to users. The project would make SUT one of the first independent power prducers in Singapore. The plant is expected to take about 27-28 months to complete once approvals are given, Tan said. -- Angela Tan, Singapore newsroom (65 8703083)
GCAT	Austrian police said on Monday they were holding a total of four men on suspicion of producing child pornography in an international child prostitution ring spanning central Europe. A fourth suspect, a 48-year-old Austrian citizen from Salzburg, was arrested on August 31 and is in detention by court order pending further investigation, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. Three others, aged between 40 and 51 and based in Vienna, were arrested last week and also remain in detention pending investigation. Two are Austrian citizens, one born in Slovakia and the other in the Czech Republic. The third is Polish. In what marked the start of a major operation to hunt down suspected child sex abusers in Austria, vice squad officers last week seized boxes of videos and other pornographic material from the home of one of the four suspects. Police said the search for others involved in the child sex trade ring could spill over into neighbouring Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Germany. Police declined to comment on whether there was any connection between the arrests and a Belgian child pornography scandal in which at least two young girls were murdered. Belgian Marc Dutroux, alleged to be the ringleader in a paedophile pornography circuit, has been named by police in the Slovak capital Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of one Slovak woman and the kidnapping of another. The series of sex scandals has deeply shocked Austrians, already troubled by last week's revelations of another alleged sex case in Linz, 200 km (120 miles) west of Vienna, involving the abuse of refugee children as young as four. The prosecuting attorney in Linz said on Monday that two Austrian men arrested for suspected sex abuse of children from a refugee home had been released pending further investigation. The news of the releases provoked an outcry from social workers, who expressed concern about the young victims' safety. "It doesn't seem to be sensible that the two alleged culprits are free again," said Josef Weidenholzer, head of the social organisation Volkshilfe in Linz. "Someone must not have been thinking what consequences this could have." The men were alleged to have lured children from the refugee shelter by offering them between 500 and 5,000 schillings ($50 to $500) for sex, sources close to the investigation said. "One of the men allegedly focused on little girls and the other only dealt with little boys," Weidenholzer said. Austrian current affairs weekly News last week published a investigative report into extensive child sexual exploitation in the region. It said the ring provided clients in Vienna with a choice of 70 girls, largely from Slovakia, aged between seven and 13. The Volkshilfe, which has been investigating the refugee sex abuse claims for an undisclosed period, said that case also probably involved a larger ring of professional child abusers. "The sums of money involved are too large and our investigations have shown the contact between the children and their abusers was frequent," Weidenholzer said. "There were certainly more people involved in this terrible tragedy."
CCAT	Blue-chip Shanghai Diesel Engine Co Ltd reported a 4.86 percent fall in 1996 net profits on Friday and analysts blamed tight national credit policies which have hit most of its clients. The company's 1996 net profit was 143.821 million yuan against 151.164 million yuan in 1995, based on domestic accounting standards, a company statement in Friday's Shanghai Securities News said. According to international accounting standards, its 1996 net profit was 126.688 million yuan, the statement said but did not give comparative figures. The company statement said government policy was the key factor for the decline in profit, a reference to the tight credit policies in force since 1993. "Price rises for water and electricity also dragged down our profits," it said. An analysis report from Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co Ltd said the company had to take care to control soaring accounts receivables, resulting from cash shortages among many of Diesel's customers.   The company statement said Shanghai Diesel's joint venture with Caterpillar Inc, which started operations in early 1995, remained in loss last year, which also pulled down Diesel's profits, the company statement said. The joint venture, in which Shanghai Diesel has a 45 percent stake, reported a loss of 40.283 million yuan in 1996, it said. The two sides are discussing how to solve the venture's problems, Diesel officials have said. Despite the company's decline in 1996 profit, major brokerages in Shanghai still recommend its B shares as a "buy" due to its long-term good outlook. "Looser credit control in 1997 should be in favour of Diesel," said a report from ING Barings. With 70 percent of its output used in construction machinery and heavy duty engines, the company will benefit from the expected 13 percent year-on-year growth of the transportation and infrastructure sectors through to 2000, it said. China's biggest brokerage, Shenyin & Wanguo, also recommended Shanghai Diesel as a "buy". Trading of Shanghai Diesel was suspended on Friday morning and will resume in the afternoon on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
CCAT	The listing committee of the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) on Friday accepted the application of Czech chemicals, arms and trading conglomerate Chemapol Group a.s. for listing on its parallel market, a PSE official said. Chemapol, which is a huge holding company but has been closely-held, has not been publicly traded on any of the PSE's three markets.   "Chemapol Group worked out and submitted (an application) to the listing committee and was approved for listing on the parallel market," the committee's Pavla Vodstrcilova told Reuters. The company still has to fulfill several formal conditions before it is listed, including publishing an announcement of the listing and paying a fee to the bourse. Chemapol shares have so far been traded in negligible amounts on the over-the-counter market, the RM-System. Companies listed on the main and parallel markets of the PSE are required to publish quarterly results.   Chemapol's owners, which include large Czech banks, refineries and the management, approved a rights issue last month of between 500 milion and 1.64 billion crowns to expand the group's current basic capital of 1.68 billion. The fast-growing conglomerate, which controlled, at last count in August, 67 chemical, industrial, trading and media companies, also plans a minimum 600 million crown Global Depositary Receipts issue next year. Chemapol has grown from mostly oil trading company -- a business it was partially pushed out of by local refineries -- to control an estimated 20 billion crowns in equity throughout its vast holdings.  The group reported consolidated unaudited net profit for the first half of this year of 290 million crowns on sales of 29 billion crowns. It posted audited net profit of 62.5 million crowns in 1995 on the sales of over 40 billion. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003
ECAT	Asia and Europe can find common ground in business priorities but must continue to open markets and work to understand each other politically and culturally, speakers told a World Economic Forum meeting on Tuesday. "Perhaps the most important barrier to the realisation of an Asia-Europe community remains cultural and psychological," Amnuay Viravan, Thailand's deputy prime minister, told a plenary session of the Europe/East Asia Economic Summit. "Does the wider European public appreciate the norms and differences in Asian cultures in the way that many Asians have become familiar with European customs and norms?" The European understanding of convergence had nothing to do with the imposition of a single system or the domination of one nation by another, Austria's economics minister Johann Farnleitner said. "What we see as the main topic of convergence is financial discipline and stability but under equal market access rules," he said. Amnuay said the two regions risked becoming distracted from their courtship by regional issues such as economic and monetary union in Europe, or "locked into opposing positions" before the fledgling Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) had time to develop. He said he would like progress to come from a "regional basis" instead of between individual countries. "We are entering a new era of globalisation and certainly we want to be competitive, with cooperation from our partners," he told Reuters after the session. "I think the real success of the first ASEM was to recognise the importance of open regionalism." Christopher Roberts, Britain's deputy secretary of trade and industry, told the delegates that European and Asian businesspeople shared the same needs but said convergence was a "global phenomenon" not limited to the two regions. He said the two regions had made progress towards common understanding since the first ASEM summit in Bangkok in March which brought together heads of 15 European states and Japan, China, South Korea, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Indonesia's investment minister Santoyo Sastrowardoyo said only 12.8 percent of the country's accumulated foreign direct investment comes from the European Union, adding that European countries could be doing a better job compared to Asians. "Their decision-making processes are very, very conservative," he said. "Sometimes, many times, they are left behind and miss the train." The solution, Santoyo said, was to conduct business with equality, make decisions faster and find the optimum combination of competitive advantages. Business still faced barriers to entry despite advances made at the Uruguay Round of trade talks, Peter McGauran, Australia's science and technology minister, told the session. He told Reuters after the session that governments should promote trade and open markets by bringing business groups together. "We think the worst thing you could do was have politicians and bureaucrats deciding what the priorities are," he said. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852)2843-6441

ECAT	China and Nepal were expected to sign an agreement to boost economic cooperation during the first visit by a Chinese president to the Himalayan kingdom in 12 years, officials said on Monday. Jiang Zemin was scheduled to arrive in Nepal's capital of Kathmandu from Pakistan on Wednesday as the guest of King Birendra, the world's only Hindu monarch. King Birendra visited China in August. Jiang, who was set to meet Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and the leader of the communist United Marxist-Leninist (UML) party, Man Mohan Adhikary, was expected to sign an accord to strengthen bilateral economic ties, officials said. Nepal's trade defict with China widened to $52.9 million in the 1994/95 financial year, which ended in mid-July 1995, up from $43.8 million the previous year. Many Nepali businessmen eye neighbouring Tibet as a promising market. "Nepal can be an ideal place to supply many, many products required in Tibet for its development construction," said Padma Jyoti, president of the Federation of the Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Nepal, which liberalised its economy in 1992, has invited Chinese investment in water resources and tourism. A Chinese business delegation in October discussed possible joint ventures in hydropower, pharmaceuticals, cement, poultry farming, garments and sport shoes with Nepal. The kingdom tightened security in anticipation of possible demonstrations by Tibetan exiles. "We will not allow any anti-China activities in our soil," senior Foreign Ministry official Janak Bahadur Singh. Some 20,000 exiled Tibetans live in Nepal. Kathmandu, sandwiched between China to the north and India to the south, recognises China's sovereignty over Tibet and bows to Beijing's sensitivities over Taiwan. China has governed the deeply religious Himalayan region of Tibet since its People's Liberation Army marched into Lhasa in 1950. In early 1995, Nepal, fearing a possible objection from Beijing, refused to allow a planned peace march by Tibetans through Nepal from Dharmasala in northern India to Lhasa. The march was later called off by the Tibetan exiles. Last month, at least two Tibetans fleeing their homeland were injured when Nepali police fired at them in a remote village in the Himalayan kingdom. Jiang's visit to Nepal will be the third leg of a week-long trip to South Asia. Last Friday, during Jiang's three-day visit to India, China and India signed an agreement aimed at reducing tensions along their Himalayan border where they fought a war in 1962. In Islamabad on Sunday, Jiang discussed the continuation of peaceful nuclear cooperation with Pakistan during a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart, Farooq Leghari.
CCAT	Greece's private Xiosbank is taking the stock market road with subscriptions for its IPO set for April 15-18, bank executives told reporters on Tuesday. Xiosbank which had pretax profit of 2.1 billion drachmas in 1996 will offer the investment public 1,592,450 common registered shares at 2,650 drachmas or 7.9 times its 1996 pretax profit. These along with 79,610 shares privately placed with its staff will bring its post-IPO total outstanding shares to 7,962,220 with a par value of 1,000 drachmas. Proceeds from the public offering and the private placement will amount to 4.43 billion.

Greek brokers including Telesis, Alpha, Sigma, Omega Devletoglou, Alpha Finance will also co-underwrite the issue. HSBC Investment Bank-James Capel will place a significant part with foreign investors. Issue advisor is Telesis Capital. The new shares will be entitled to the 1997 dividend. The minimum trading lot will be 10 shares. IPO proceeds will finance Xiosbank's 1997-2000 investment programme which will see expansion of its branch network to 45 branches by the year 2000 from 20 presently. Xiosbank currently employs 580. It ranked 13th among Greek banks in terms of 1995 total assets and 12th in terms of deposits. Based on the IPO prospectus, 1997 profits before taxes are expected to grow to 2.7 billion drachmas, a conservative projection, general manager Yannis Pehlivanidis said. Following the IPO, main shareholder Vardis Vardinoyannis will see his stake drop to 12.92 percent from 16.35 percent presently. --George Georgiopoulos, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
GCAT	The United States condemned on Thursday a Serbian crackdown on anti-government protesters and said it was continuing to hold President Slobodan Milosevic responsible for any resultant violence. "We repeat our call on the Serbian authorities to show restraint and to not interfere with the protesters' democractic rights," a State Department spokesman said. "We continue to hold Milosevic responsible for any violence which may occur."   In Belgrade, riot police forced opposition demonstrators off the streets on Thursday as the Serbian government cracked down on more than five weeks of protests against Milosevic. A spokeswoman for the Zajedno opposition parties said the coalition feared its three main leaders were about to be arrested. The State Department blasted the new restrictions on the anti-government protests as "an attempt to prevent the marchers from exercising their rights and can only serve to increase the possibility of confrontation and violence." "What we've seen is 36, 37 days of ... peaceful demonstrations," department spokesman John Dinger told reporters. "They only became violent through the provocative and irresponsible actions of the Serbian government" when it organized a counter-demontration on Tuesday.

GCAT	The Burmese government said on Thursday that the Australian charge d'affaires in Rangoon had apologised after his wife forcibly took down a national flag flown at a residence in the compound where they live. Rosalind Eva Ransome, wife of charge d'affaires Simeon Richard Gilding, demanded that a Burmese family living in their compound take down the flag, which they had hoisted in commemoration of the golden jubilee of Union Day on Wednesday. Local employees refused to take down the flag but Ransome pulled it down herself, a government statement said. A member of the Burmese family decided to complain to local authorities about the incident. "The Australian charge d'affaires came to the office of the local administrative authorities with his wife later that day and tendered his apology for the incident, it is learnt," the statement said. Gilding declined to commment on the incident and referred all inquiries to the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Australia.
CCAT	The 1,070 megawatt (MW) unit 2 at the San Onofre nuclear power plant in San Clemente, Calif., is expected to synchronize Tuesday with the regional grid sometime between 2000 and 2400 PDT, a spokesman for the plant said. The schedule represents a slight delay from Monday's expectation for the unit to start generating power by late this afternoon. The spokesman said the unit's reactor remains in hot standby and is expected to be at 15 to 20 percent capacity when the grid reconnection takes place. "There will be a couple of hold points on the way (up to full power). We anticipate reaching 100 percent within 24 to 72 hours," he added. Unit 2 was shut in late June for unplanned repairs. Meanwhile, San Onofre's 1,080 MW unit 3 is still scheduled to restart Thursday, although there is a remote chance it could be back up by late Wednesday night, the spokesman said. Unit 3, which has been down since mid-April for refueling, is expected to take longer to ramp up to full power due to testing requirements, he noted. The San Onofre plant is 75 percent owned by Southern California Edison Co, which also operates the plant. ((--Deena Beasley, Los Angeles bureau + 1 213 955 6761))
MCAT	U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets Monday were quiet, with no reported trades, feedlot sources said. Bids were light at $66.00 per cwt and passed by owners asking $69.00 for cattle, they said. Packers reportedly were comfortably supplied with live inventory to get through this week and probably would not be in the market until Wednesday or Thursday, the sources said. Firm beef prices were expected to underpin fed cattle prices once they do start trading again, several feedlot managers said.   Prices were seen $68.00, or higher, if beef prices and CME live cattle futures remain firm, the managers said. Showlists were mostly sold out last week, which also could lend support as feedlots remain extremely current in their marketings, they said. Showlists this week in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area were estimated near 95,500 head, down 4,500 from last week, market sources said. The showlist in Kansas was estimated near 85,000 head, down about 100 from last week. Nebraska's showlist was estimated near 80,000 head, up 3,000 from last week. ((Bob Janis 312-408-8720))
ECAT	Pakistan can meet its budget targets in fiscal 1997/98 (July-June) only if it curbs its fiscal deficit, analysts said on Wednesday. "If the government can control the fiscal deficit within the five percent target, all other targets will follow suit," Kalim Aziz, head of research at ING Baring Securities, said. A deficit target of five percent of gross domestic product is likely to be the cornerstone of next year's budget, to be presented on Friday. This year's deficit is expected to be at least as wide as last year's 6.3 percent of GDP. Officials say the goal can be achieved through deep spending cuts and extra revenue from the economic growth they expect to flow from tax and tariff reductions unveiled soon after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif swept to power in February 3 polls. The economy, hit by slow agricultural growth and industrial recession, has shown few signs yet of responding to Sharif's supply-side measures, which will need time to make an impact. Meanwhile, analysts say, it is vital to keep the fiscal deficit in check to avert the need for expensive government borrowing and in turn restrain inflation and production costs. "If inflation is controlled it will reduce the differential between domestic and international prices and will cut the trade and current account deficits through higher exports," Aziz said. Jahanzeb Naseer, research head at Jardine Fleming Pakistan, said revenue collection would be the key factor in deciding whether the government could meet its other budget targets. He said Sharif's supply-side measures were steps in the right direction, but a contingency plan should be ready in case the government faced a cash crunch before the strategy paid off. Local newspapers say the budget will fix a revenue target of 325 billion rupees ($8.026 billion), well below last year's original target of 340 billion, but higher than actual 1996/97 collection, thought unlikely to exceed 290 billion rupees. Nadeem Naqvi, head of research at International Asset Management Co Ltd, said tax collection machinery needed to be overhauled if next year's revenue goal was to be met. A report by the International Monetary Fund has told the government that plans to impose sales tax at the retail level stand little chance of success without more preparatory work. Naqvi said the government would find it hard to slash the spending side of the budget. "With three quarters or more of revenue going into debt servicing and defence, even a nominal cut in expenditure will be very difficult," he said. Naqvi advocated a bold cut in military spending, a sensitive area given the power of a defence establishment that can point to Pakistan's standoff with India to justify its cash demands. Analysts say the government might sanction a modest nominal rise in defence outlay, slightly reducing it in real terms. Naseer said tax cuts and reductions of tariffs on raw material imports, designed to boost exports beyond $9 billion, would lower production costs and should stimulate industry to switch to production of higher value-added items. However, he said lower tariffs would immediately hit customs duty collection, a large part of total revenue. "The measures are not focused enough for an export boost in dollar terms as Pakistan has a narrow export base, mostly comprising the lower segment of textile products," Naqvi said. He said rupee depreciation would fuel inflation, which would in turn make competitive pricing of export goods difficult. Pakistan aims to bring inflation, officially estimated at 13 percent in 1996/97, down to nine percent in 1997/98. Naqvi said this would require drastic cuts in current and public development spending, from which the government might shy away due to their risky social and political consequences.
GCAT	Serbia's opposition leaders warned their supporters on Saturday that ruling Socialists were preparing to enlist the help of hardline nationalists in an attempt to undermine nearly 70 days of street demonstrations. Vuk Draskovic, one of the leaders of the opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition, told a rally in Belgrade that President Slobodan Milosevic "has decided to replay his patriotic song" that helped ignite four years of war in the Balkans. "Unless we stop him, he'll 'unify' Serbia in the way he 'unified' Yugoslavia," Draskovic told a small crowd in the city centre. Draskovic's comments coincided with reports that Milosevic's ruling Socialists had turned to the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party to help shore up its damaged position. Milosevic, widely blamed for plunging former Yugoslavia into war in 1991, has accused the Zajedno coalition of plotting to destabilise Serbia in daily street protests. Zajedno, joined by university students, has vowed to keep up its campaign until authorities recognise opposition victories in Belgrade and elsewhere in November municipal elections. Saturday's rally drew several thousand people to Republic Square, a smaller turnout than previous protests. Many supporters were joining neighbourhood "promenades" which Zajedno organised after increasingly tough police action had prevented mass street marches that blocked traffic. Opposition followers were concerned over a rising number of reports of police beatings. Riot police on Thursday clubbed protesters seated on a highway into the central town of Kragujevac, beating one member of parliament unconscious. Independent radio stations B-92 and Index reported beatings in several Belgrade districts as police ambushed small groups of people making their way to a student rally on Friday. University students braved winter temperatures on Saturday to keep up a round-the-clock vigil on Kolaceva street in front of a police cordon. The stand-off began last Sunday when police blocked attempts to hold a march through the city centre. University students have organised a 24-hour vigil in a bid to outlast the police cordon, rotating groups of students in shifts. A group of journalists from the state-run Politika newspaper, considered a government mouthpiece, lent support to the students on Saturday, delivering a cake to the protesters. Milosevic's Socialists discussed the unprecedented threat to five decades of unbroken communist and socialist rule at a session of the party's central committee on Friday. Belgrade independent media reported party officials were ready to invite hardline nationalists to join the government to help them portray the opposition as traitors. The independent daily "Nasa Borba", citing unnamed sources, said the party was planning a government reshuffle and a renewed media assault on the Zajedno opposition. The Zajedno protests that have swept Belgrade and cities across the country represented an "attack on the state by the same people who broke the old Yugoslavia", the paper quoted Milosevic as saying at the session. The former communist party chief has relied on his vast police force and his state television station to try to stifle the wave of street demonstrations. The protests -- marked by an irreverent, carnival atmosphere -- have won strong Western support and sparked divisions within the Socialist ranks. The republic of Montenegro, which together with Serbia comprises what is left of Yugoslavia, has also sharply criticised Milosevic's handling of the crisis. Milosevic has remained aloof and out of public view during the crisis while his deputies have sent out mixed signals, shifting from promises of concessions to stern warnings and communist-style rhetoric.

MCAT	Premiums for European Union (EU) white sugars have remained at low levels so far this year despite steady pre-Ramadan buying by Middle East consumers and a number of tenders, physical brokers said on Friday. "The premiums are quite low and EUs are having to compete with sugars that are not of the same quality. There are fewer quality homes," said one broker. EU sugars were quoted at $3/6 bid/offer over March futures for February/March cargoes from northern Europe's four main ports, broadly the same as a few weeks ago. Premiums were not vastly different for further forward months, sources said. One broker quoted a January cargo at a $2 premium. Middle East buyers have been active over the past month, with Iran importing 45 ICUMSA whites and also raws for refining. Traders said Iran bought one cargo of Feb/March whites at a reported price of $306 per tonne this week, another for March at $303.25 and 30,000 tonnes of February raws at $264. Syria and Libya both issued buying tenders this week, while Algeria and Morocco have been importing raw sugar. But a number of bearish factors have combined to put a lid on any rise in EU premiums, market sources said. "The Indian and Turkish sugar that is being put on the market obviously helps to put a dampener on the whole thing," said one. Traders cited the gradual release of India's massive stocks onto the market, coupled with Turkey's recent tender to sell 50,000 tonnes of whites. The new Middle East refineries are also poised to carve out a hefty portion of the EU's market base in the region. So supply of quality sugar should not be a problem in the future, especially as the EU is forecast to turn in a good 1996/97 crop. Turkey agreed with Iran in December to sell it 50,000 tonnes of sugar and later said the amount could be raised if necessary. Last month, Turkey said it was told by a senior delegation from Tehran that Iran needed to buy about 600,000 tonnes of sugar this year, some of which could come from Turkey. Local Turkish companies are reported to have bought the offered sugar and possibly sell it on to Iran, further undercutting European producers. "They've taken away a bit of the (EU's) export market," a trader said. Other London traders said they expected Turkey to issue more selling tenders as it moved to rid itself of unwanted stocks, because a high beet support price removed the need to hold high strategic stocks. "They're talking a lot about de-stocking some of their sugar so we may see another couple of selling tenders from there," the broker said. Latin American cane producers such as Mexico are also turning out white sugar but much of this is thought to be destined for west African buyers, who are importing higher quality sugars. "Mexico whites are mainly 45 (ICUMSA) plus some other stuff...it's going into west Africa, Colombo and so on," said another physical trader. "But EU freight rates are working relatively competitively too in west Africa," she said. Traders quoted Mexican 45 ICUMSA cargoes at a $2 discount to London futures after a $10 discount around a month ago. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8064

GCAT	Prepared for Reuters by The Broadcast Monitoring Company -- FACTORY PRICE INFLATION FALLS According to figures from the Office of National Statistics, the level of factory gate inflation in January fell to its lowest level for a decade -- with the price of goods leaving factories during the period having risen by just 1.5 per cent. Thanks in the main to the strength of sterling, the cost of raw materials for manufacturers fell 6.3 per cent during the 12 months to January. However, a quarterly inflation report due on Tuesday from the Bank of England is expected to warn that underlying retail price inflation is in danger of exceeding government targets. -- MANCHESTER TO GET 43 MILLION STG BOOST FOR REBUILDING As part of a continuing effort to rebuild the centre of Manchester, devastated in a huge IRA bomb attack last year, the city has secured 43 million stg in government investment. Manchester Millennium, a group established to oversee the reconstruction, expects the amount of investment in the programme to exceed 500 million stg. Leading retailer Marks & Spencer has announced that it will be building its second-biggest outlet to replace the local store, damaged in the attack. -- BA PROFITS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS British Airways has announced an increase in third quarter profits of 8.7 per cent, to 113 million stg. The figures were above City expectations and resulted in a rise in company share prices. To mark the 10th anniversary of its privatisation, BA is offering 200 return tickets to fly on Concorde to New York for just 10 stg each -- the usual fare is in excess of 5,000 stg. It is reported that analysts have compared BA favourably with European competitors which are turning in much weaker performances. -- TAX EXPERTS CONDEMN 'MONSTROUS' NEW PAYMENT PLAN There has been an angry reaction among tax experts to a provision within the Finance Bill that will allow Customs and Excise to claim directly from banks overdue tax payments. While Customs and Excise have defended the extension of its powers, noting that the measure simplify proceedings, critics have expressed alarm about the fact that the process will not involve the courts, describing the move as "monstrous". -- TORIES PLAN TRANSFER OF ALL PUBLIC HOUSING STOCK The Department of the Environment has announced that in the long term it is planned that local authorities will be obliged to transfer all of their housing stock to the private sector. Unless councils have made provision for such transfers they will find that central government funding for repairs and improvements is reduced. An opposition Labour Party spokesman has noted that it would halt the scheme if it wins the next general election. -- SOUTH WEST FORCED TO CUT TRAINS AFTER DEAL ON DRIVERS It has been revealed that South West Trains, one of the first rail companies to be privatised, is having to reduce services after the company under-estimated the effects of its strategy of cutting the number of drivers employed. Having to cut up to 14 trains per day will come as something of an embarrassment to the Stagecoach group which had secured the franchise on a promise to improve services and may well send a warning to others in the sector. -- NATIONAL EXPRESS LEADS SCOTRAIL RACE It is reported that National Express is expected to be selected as the preferred bidder for ScotRail, opening the way for the company to take over the franchise for railway services in Scotland. The coach group has already secured three franchises in this field and an announcement confirming the success of its ScotRail bid is expected within two weeks. It is not anticipated that securing the deal, which has been beset by complications, will present any competition problems. -- NATWEST MARKETS POISED TO BUY HOUSING LOAN BOOK It is reported that NatWest Markets has emerged as the preferred bidder over three other rivals to take over the loans book of the Housing Corporation and Housing for Wales, worth in the region of one billion stg. It is expected that the sale, which should raise in excess of one billion stg for the government, will be completed at Easter. It is thought that the choice of NatWest Markets will be welcomed by the housing associations. -- WATER AND GAS COMPANIES FACE DATABASE CURBS It is believed that in the next few weeks the Data Protection Registrar will take steps to prevent utility companies making use of their electronic databases in order to target customers for offers of additional services. The issue was brought into focus by attempts by Southern Water to offer customers details of services offered by its parent company Scottish Power. Some industry sources have noted that a test case may be required in order to clarify what is currently a grey area legally. BMC +44-171-377-1742
ECAT	A key gauge of economic activity rebounded in May from its first drop in more than a year in April, the Conference Board said on Tuesday in a report that should reinforce expectations of stronger growth ahead. The Index of Leading Indicators, which is supposed to forecast economic trends six to nine months ahead, rose 0.3 percent in May after falling 0.1 percent in April. Analysts had expected the index to post a 0.2 percent gain in May.
GCAT	Regional governors backed by President Boris Yeltsin took a narrow lead in local elections on Sunday and the brother of maverick politician Alexander Lebed won the poll in a district of Western Siberia. But communist leader Gennady Zyuganov insisted on Monday that the results were "a complete success" for the opposition. The results, published by Russian news agencies on Monday, showed that Kremlin appointees took the governorships in six of the 15 regions holding such polls. Two other Kremlin appointees will be favourites in second round votes. Candidates from the communist-led Union of National and Patriotic Forces, which groups communists and other opposition forces won in four regions and were strong in two where run-off votes were due. The Kremlin and the opposition have each claimed success in previous regional elections, which select local governors who then sit on the Federation Council upper house of parliament. Zyuganov told a news conference that the opposition would be able to expand its national power base as a result of its gains in recent weeks. The opposition, which already dominates the State Duma lower house, has said it is close to winning control over the Federation Council. But the Kremlin says most of the newly elected governors are either government supporters or, at the least, are not hardline opponents. Presidential chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais has said he wants a pragmatic, apolitical cooperation with the regions. Several communist-backed new governors have appeared on platforms with officials from Chubais's Kremlin administration, pledging their willingness to work with the government. One independent candidate was elected in Khakassia in Western Siberia, where voters chose independent Alexei Lebed, the brother of former Security Council secretary Alexander Lebed, in a run-off. Kremlin officials said earlier this month that Alexei Lebed had a "constructive position". Yeltsin sacked Alexander Lebed in October, accusing him of harbouring presidential ambitions and splitting the Kremlin team. In the vast but thinly populated diamond-rich republic of Yakutia, reformist incumbent president Mikhail Nikolayev was re-elected in a runoff vote. Governors directly appointed by Yeltsin won in the Arctic Arkhangelsk region, in Chukotka across the Bering Strait from Alaska, in Taimyr in Siberia, Perm in the Urals and the Volga region Ulyanovsk. Opposition candidates won in central Russia's Kostroma and Ryazan regions, in Chelyabinsk in the Urals, and in the fertile agricultural region of Krasnodar in southern Russia. A total of 55 regional polls have been held so far and 41 governors have been elected.
MCAT	Britain's FTSE 100 index opened mixed on Monday, with sterling's strength, interest rate concerns and continued pre-Budget nerves keeping investors wary, dealers said. Attention was focused on the futures market, they said, after the September contract dived to a discount to spot on Friday, dragging down the FTSE. The blue-chip index opened 3.1 points firmer at 4,597.0, helped higher by a leap in National Westminster Bank shares, up 30p at 776-1/2 on press reports that it could be the subject of a bid from Barclays Plc .
MCAT	Sri Lanka's state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has awarded its light naphtha export tender for May to Swiss trader Glencore at $1.23 per barrel below Singapore spot quotes, free-on board (fob) Colombo, a CPC source said on Friday. The tender which offered the 110,000-125,000-barrel cargo for May 2-3 lifting, closed on April 23 and bids were valid for two days. CPC received four bids for the cargo, the source said.   The bearish naphtha market has depressed prices and in its last tender, CPC sold to Japanese trader Tomen 110,000-125,000 barrels of light naphtha at a much higher price of 88 cents per barrel below Singapore spot quotes, for March 24-25 lifting fob Colombo. -- Singapore Newsroom (+65-870 3086)
CCAT	Shares in Bre-X Minerals Ltd dropped and shares in Barrick Gold Corp rose after Barrick said on Monday the two companies had submitted a joint proposal to operate the massive Busang gold project in Indonesia. Bre-X was down C$1 to C$20 in heavy trading of 2.2 million shares by mid-morning. Barrick rose C$0.65 to C$39.45. But the announcement did not dissipate the investor uncertainty that has shadowed Bre-X for months, analysts said. "There are no details," said gold analyst John Ing with Maison Placements Canada Inc.   "There are all different kinds of rumors as to how much (Barrick will pay) but I don't think we'll know anything until the Indonesian government responds," Ing said. Barrick said the two companies had formed a proposal along lines suggested by the Indonesian government last month. But the proposal still requires government blessing, Barrick said. While Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said the two companies "have come to mutually acceptable terms" after negotiations this weekend, a matching statement from Bre-X was conspicuously missing, analysts said. Bre-X was expected to make a statement this afternoon.   The Calgary-based company did not return calls. "It's quite possible that they may not have a deal," said Ing. The announcement from Barrick "almost looks like a trial balloon," he said. Negotiations between Bre-X and Barrick to split up Busang have been plagued by twists and turns. While the Indonesian government has clearly favored Barrick to act as Bre-X's partner, Bre-X has made no secret that it wants an open bidding process for its stake in Busang. And many Bre-X shareholders have said they fear negotiations with Barrick will not be fair since the talks were virtually mandated by the Indosian government. Some of them have threatened legal action if the deal is unfair. "Barrick has an established track record of being fair," responded Borg, who said this deal would not be any different. Meanwhile, Indonesian officials have put pressure on Barrick and Bre-X to sort things out quickly. The government extended a November 22 deadline to December 4, and then extended it again to the end of December. ((Heather Scoffield, Reuters Toronto Bureau 416 941-8104))
MCAT	Investors should seek value at the short end of peripheral European curves as prospects for further monetary easing swell, analysts said on Thursday. Little change is likely after Thursday's monetary meetings in France, Switzerland and Britain, while in Sweden too rates are likely to remain on hold. But in Italy and Spain expected easings near term offer the most investor opportunities. "Investors should be looking at the short ends in continental Europe for curve steepening trades," said Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW in London. "This trend can continue across the board but the most interesting will be the Spanish and Italian front ends." Key Spanish inflation data due on Friday and a good inflation performance in Italy have led many analysts to expect rate cuts in the near future. Reed said if the Spanish consumer price index was in line with expectations there could be an intervention rate cut as early as Tuesday. "In Italy the government is not out of the woods completely, but there is a mini-budget which opens the door to further Bank of Italy easing especially given the inflation performance," she said. Teis Knuthsen, international economist at Frist Chicago in London, agreed. He said while both the Italian and Spanish markets had seen some curve steepeninng over the past few days, the interest rate futures were still too conservatively priced. At 1041 GMT, LIFFE June Eurolira futures were at 93.04, down 0.03 on the day. But Huw Roberts, European bond strategist at NatWest Markets in London said to a large extent a rate cut had been priced in in Spain. "The reality of a rate cut won't have that much of a beneficial impact, it is largely discounted already," he said. "Italy is a little more difficult to call. It has steepened up quite aggressively over the last week or so but that is as much of a reaction to dramatic curve flattening over January and February." Knuthsen said in Sweden too there was the possibility that the Riksbank would cut rates, but not until after the government announces its budget on April 15. "If there is a favourable reception it is very likely the Riksbank will cut rates once more," he said. But some analysts said there was an argument to be made for buying into Swedish bonds now. "In an international context Sweden is in an enviable position on its public finances," said John McNeill, bond market strategist at I.D.E.A. in London. "All the fundamentals are in place...and the market is very undemandingly priced." Elsewhere in Europe, analysts said the Bank of France may cut its 5-10 day rate but that was likely to have little impact. "If they cut by 10 basis points it will be at 4.5 percent, which is where the German Lombard rate is so will harmonise their short term interest rates. It is more likely to be on that side than the intervention rate," said Roberts. Reed said there was scope for a small cut in the intervention rate, which is currently at 3.10 percent. "The French franc is firm enough to allow for such a thing. It may not be today, but any time now," she said. Knuthsen said aside from Italy, Spain and Sweden it was difficult to be too bouyant for European interest rate futures. "For core Europe we are now past the point where further rate cuts can be expected," he said. "We will get into a period where gradually markets will start to price in the first tightening. If anything the chance is that the markets will be too aggressive in anticipating rate hikes in core Europe which are very unlikely to appear in 1997." --International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 4041
MCAT	NWE oil products were mixed on Friday. Gasoline bounced up $8 or so as three cat crackers at three different  NWE refineries encountered difficulties. Tight local supplies and  good U.S. demand was a receipe for higher prices, dealers said. Gas oil spreads were little changed and volumes were small. Larger  heating oil barges were around $1 over August. Outright prices firmed  as August IPE rose $2.25 a tonne to $171.50. High sulphur fuel's unseasonal summer strength continued, with barges  traded from $92.50-$93.50 a tonne, as Russian cracked and straight-run  fuel continued to flow towards North America.

GCAT	Prime Minister Gyula Horn has asked the seven parties in parliament to discuss whether Hungary should join a multinational security force in Albania, Hungarian Television said on Tuesday. The parties will discuss the issue on Wednesday and the government is likely to make its decision on Thursday, the television said. A 5,000-strong force is being put together by Italy after receiving approval from the United Nations on Friday. The multinational force is intended to protect humanitarian relief operations in Albania, where food and medical supplies are lacking after weeks of widespread unrest.
CCAT	CompuServe Corp said Tuesday it anticipates a second-quarter loss of about $0.10-$0.15 a share due to new product introductions. "Incremental costs associated with the introduction of CompuServe 3.0 and the release of 'WOW! teens view' are anticipated to result in a quarter-quarter loss of approximately $0.10-$0.15 a share," Bob Massey, president and chief executive officer, said in the company's first-quarter report. It posted a first-quarter loss of $0.19 a share before non-recurring charges (Corrects to add "before non-recurring charges.") But the on-line service unveiled cost cuts and other measures and said it expects the second half to improve.  The company said, as forecast earlier, that a decline in subscriber growth, investments in its WOW! service for novice users and infrastructure improvements hurt the first quarter. Subscribers declined from the previous quarter as cancellations outpaced new subscribers, it said. Cost cutting measures include the pending sale of its corporate computer software group of SPRY, Inc. It will also consolidate U.S. staff functions and offices, restructure some third-party customer service agreements and write off software costs for some systems no longer in use, it said. The moves are designed to save $20 million in the rest of the current April-ending year and $30 million on an annualized basis. Massey said most of the 150 job cuts have taken place. That amounts to about four percent of the workforce. Massey said CompuServe is well positioned for substantial gains in the weeks and years ahead. International growth and additional revenue sources such as advertising, interchange and transaction fees should also contribute, CompuServe said. "Coupled with new product releases and aggressive marketing campaigns, we expect the third and fourth quarters to improve with subscribers topping the seven million mark including our Japanese licensee service, NiftyServe," he said. --Cleveland Newsdesk 216-579-0077
ECAT	St. Paul City Council has approved  financing for a new downtown office tower complex including $34 million  of bonds. City Council on Wednesday approved the plan for the new office, retail  and parking complex to house the Lawson Software Co headquarters.  Lawson's offices are now located in Minneapolis. The financing includes $34 million of general obligation tax increment  financing bonds to acquire the land and build the parking garage and  a $53.08 million loan from Newcourt Capital Inc for the office tower  and retail development. St. Paul Housing and Redevelopment Authority will provide developer  Rice Park Associates LLC with a 27-year lease to the property. Another $400,000 of improvement bonds will be sold to finance a connection  to the downtown skyway system and officials also plan to arrange a  $2.235 million loan for construction of retail space. The development is expected to raise property taxes collected for  the block from $236,792 in 1996 to more than $1.675 million when the  build out is completed. Lawson plans to lease 240,000 to 270,000 square feet of the anticipated  370,000 square feet and St. Paul Cos plans to occupy the rest. ((--David Bailey, Chicago Newsroom, 312-408-8647))
MCAT	Tokyo naphtha prices were notionally lower in light trading on Tuesday, pressured down by the decline in crude oil prices, traders said. Traders, back from a long weekend, said the market was off to a slow start with few fresh incentives to stimulate trading. Open-spec naphtha for first-half July was nominally assessed at $206.00/$207.00 per tonne, while second-half July was notionally assessed at $207/$208.   Traders' prompt cargoes were weak and heavily in contango. "It's only until you get to second July onwards do we go back to backwardation...that's because the physical (market) certainly looks weak in the prompt," one trader said. Discussion in gas oil remained light due to ample domestic stocks and slack demand, traders said. --Tokyo Energy Desk +81-3-3432-8837
ECAT	Gavyn Davies, chief international economist at Goldman Sachs International, said he did not think there was a convincing case for substantially tightening UK fiscal policy and he did not expect a major increase in the tax burden in the forthcoming budget. Goldman Sachs and the Institute for Fiscal Studies said in their "green budget" that higher interest rates would be a better method of reining in consumer spending. Davies said the budget plans which new Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown had inherited from the ousted Conservatives already contained a sgnificant fiscal tightening. "We are tightening by about one percent of GDP per year at the moment," he told a presentation on the green budget. "There is quite a lot of fiscal restraint in the piepeline." Davies added that he was not convinced that there was a water-tight case for raising the tax burden. No date has yet been set for the budget but it is expected by early July. David Walton, director of UK economic research at Goldman Sachs, said the best way historically to dent consumer confidence was through higher interest rates. "To avoid overheating, the policy stance needs to be tight enough to slow the economy to a trend rate or below in 1998," Walton said. "Base rates may need to rise to 7.25-7.50 percent over the next year unless fiscal policy is tightened significantly further in the forthcoming budget." UK official interest rates are currently at 6.25 percent, having been increased by 25 basis points base lending rates three weeks ago. Davies said consumer taxes would need to rise by around nine billion pounds to reduce base rate pressure by one percentage point. "That seems to us a bit implausible. It doesn't look politically feasible," he added. Davies is widely tipped to be appointed a deputy governor of the Bank of England. --Richard Murphy +44 171 542 5109

GCAT	Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Sunday issued a call to boost patriotic education and national unity as Beijing struggled to handle a renewed territorial row with Japan and separatist strife in ethnic minority areas. In a speech on the front page of the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, Jiang called for a strengthening of patriotic education to help make China more powerful. "The patriotic enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country should be turned into a mighty force to promote the reform, opening-up, modernisation and revitalisation of the Chinese nation," Jiang said in the speech. The speech was delivered to senior party officials last October, but was made public as a simmering dispute between Beijing and Tokyo over an island group in the East China Sea flared up once again. "The Chinese people have never yielded to invaders, and they have the glorious tradition of ardently loving freedom, seeking progress and guarding national dignity and state sovereignty," Jiang said. "Furious hatred of foreign invaders, boundless disdain for the nation's scoundrels who sought power and wealth by betraying the country, and great reverence for the noble-minded patriots have become our precious national character," Jiang said. Beijing last week protested a landing by a group that included a conservative Japanese legislator on the islands, which are known as the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus in Japanese and are claimed by China, Taiwan and Japan. Tokyo has tried to distance itself from the landing but the incident has fueled nationalist outrage in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and flotillas of activists from those places are expected to sail to the islands this month in protest. Tokyo has said it will step up coastguard patrols around the islands, which are administered by Okinawa. The seas surrounding the islands are rich fishing grounds and are believed to contain big oil and gas reserves. Japan has claimed the islands, located between Taiwan and Okinawa, since 1895, while China says it has owned them for centuries. The sovereignty row ignited fiery nationalist passions in Chinese communities in Hong Kong and Taiwan last year after a Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse there. The publication of Jiang's speech also came after trouble flared on the opposite side of China, in its arid, far-northwestern region of Xinjiang. Beijing has been struggling to control violent ethnic strife in the mostly Moslem region, where members of the ethnic Uighur minority clash sporadically with China's majority Han people. In February, a series of bus bombs killed nine people in the capital of Urumqi and deadly riots swept through the town of Yining near the border with Kazakhstan. Last month, Chinese paramilitary police in Yining shot dead two people and injured five when a mob of more than 100 tried to rescue rioters convicted in the Yining upheaval from execution. "Some people do not care about undermining national prestige and moral integrity and do not care about the damage to state and national interests," Jiang said. Analysts say China has tried to muster patriotic fervour among its people to help fill a moral chasm created by almost two decades of capitalist-style reforms that have eroded traditional Marxist values.
ECAT	The biggest increase in retail inventories in 1-1/2 years boosted overall stocks of unsold goods during July on the shelves of wholesalers retailers and manufacturers, the Commerce Department said Monday. Total business inventories rose 0.4 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $1 trillion after being revised to show no change in June.  Previously, the department said June inventories rose 0.1 percent.   The July increase in total stocks of unsold goods was significantly stronger than the 0.2 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists, primarily because retailers added strongly to their supplies. Retail inventories jumped 1.1 percent to $307.52 billion -- the biggest increase since a 1.3 percent surge in January 1995 -- after a slight 0.1 percent June increase. Auto inventories, which show up in the retail figures, climbed strongly by 1.4 percent to $86.1 billion, the largest addition to monthly supplies since a two percent jump in March 1995.   Automakers had been expected to add to their supplies of new cars on dealer lots for fear of a strike this fall. Negotiations are currently underway between the Big Three domestic automakers and the United Auto Workers union. Manufacturers' inventories grew by 0.2 percent to $434.52 billion in July after a 0.1 percent decline in June. Wholesalers' inventories were up 0.1 percent to $259.45 billion following a 0.2 percent June gain. Total business sales in July grew by 1.2 percent to $720.55 billion after a 0.5 percent drop in June. The inventory-to-sales ratio -- a measure of how long it would take to sell existing stocks at the current pace -- fell to 1.39 months' worth in July from 1.40 months in June.

GCAT	Olympic and world high hurdles champion Allen Johnson repelled the European challenge on Friday to set a year's best time at the Bislett Games grand prix. The American, unaffected by a total of four false starts before the race finally began, clocked 13.14 seconds, relegating Germany's Olympic bronze medallist Florian Schwarthoff to second place. Schwarthoff clocked 13.21 with Britain's world silver medallist Tony Jarrett third in 13.30. Jarrett's compatriot Colin Jackson, the world record holder, was fourth 0.04 of a second further back. Johnson, who said he would race three more times before the Athens world championships in August, praised Schwarthoff's performance. "We have had a lot of tough races over the years," he said. "It was a tough race, he is very strong." The German said Johnson had dominated the first half of the race. "I will try to give him a hard time at the world championships," he said. Two Commonwealth athletes set year's bests early in the meeting, first of the Golden Four series. New Zealander Beatrice Faumunina threw a national record of 68.52 metres in the discus and Australia's Olympic silver medallist Cathy Freeman clocked 49.39 in the women's 400 metres. "I am relieved," Commonwealth champion Freeman said. "I did not think I was in that shape." Canada's Olympic and world 100 gold medallist Donovan Bailey won the 200 metres from European champion Geir Moen. Bailey, slow out of the blocks, trailed Moen at the turn but pulled back to win from the Norwegian in a wind-assisted 20.14.
ECAT	Argentina's industrial output rose between seven and nine percent in the third quarter compared with the same period last year, a senior Economy Ministry official said Monday. "All the industrial production data are pointing to between seven and nine percent growth in the third quarter compared with last year's," chief Economy Ministry advisor Carlos Rodriguez told reporters.   "The (industrial) sector recovery is a fact ... It is not a one-month statistical phenomenon, " Rodriguez said. Lower interest rates and higher peso deposits are also pointing to an economic recovery. "This is indicative of consumers' confidence," Rodriguez said. September's official industrial production figures are due on October 29. Argentina emerged in the second quarter from a year-long recession induced by the "Tequila effect" produced by the Mexican peso devaluation that jolted most emerging markets. -- Patrick Adam, Buenos Aires Newsroom +541b 318-0654
GCAT	The discovery of a putrefied body locked in a trunk in the cellar of a derelict Brussels garage has reopened a grim Belgian dossier of child abuse and murder. Belgian media speculated that the body found on Wednesday was that of Moroccan-born Loubna Benaissa, a nine-year-old girl who went missing in 1992. The mayor of the capital's Ixelles district, Yves de Jonghe d'Ardoye, told reporters early on Thursday that a suspect taken to the site had admitted murder, but gave few other details. Police said the result of an autopsy would only be known later on Thursday. Investigators with sniffer dogs and high-tech equipment had searched for hours on Wednesday in the section of Ixelles where she vanished while running an errand to a local supermarket. The area is popular with north African immigrants and dozens of Arabic-speaking residents gathered at the scene on Wednesday awaiting news of the investigation. De Jonghe d'Ardoye told reporters: "The body of a child has been found...in a trunk in a cellar." "We can't possibly say who it is because the autopsy has not taken place yet. The body is totally decomposed, we can't tell you what age it is." "It has been there for three, four, five years...it is not a recent death," he added. The investigation into Benaissa's disappearance was marked by allegations of bungling by authorities who were accused of not taking the case seriously, failing to appoint an investigating judge and for closing the file on the case after just two years. It was reopened in August last year after the discovery of bodies of four girls murdered by a gang allegedly led by child rapist Marc Dutroux. Dutroux was arrested following the rescue from a makeshift dungeon in his house of Sabine Dardenne and Laetitia Delhez -- both of whom had been sexually abused. Two days later Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight-year-old Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo, buried in the garden of one of his six houses in and around the central Belgian city of Charleroi. The girls had starved to death. Barely two weeks later Dutroux again led police to another house where they unearthed the bodies of teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks. The parents of the dead girls launched a campaign complaining at police and judicial bungling in the searches for their daughters. They were joined by the parents of other missing children including Elizabeth Brichet and Loubna. In October more than 250,000 people took to the streets of Brussels in what came to be known as the White March -- the biggest peacetime demonstration of its kind in the country. Early on Thursday, activists from the populist group gathered in Ixelles to hand out leaflets and pictures of children still unaccounted for. -- Brussels newsroom ++ 32 2 287 6832
GCAT	The U.S. State Department on Tuesday defended last week's decision to certify Mexico as an ally in the war on drugs, saying Mexico's cooperation in the fight against narcotics traffickers was essential. Given the shared 2,000-mile (3,219 km) U.S.-Mexican border, "if we walk away from the Mexicans, we'll be shooting ourself in the foot," spokesman Nicholas Burns said, responding to criticism from Congress and elsewhere. "We need the Mexicans to win this (anti-drugs) war, and they need us. We have this symbiotic relationship with Mexico that nobody can disregard. And if we're going to win the war on drugs, we've got to have the cooperation with the Mexicans," he said. Burns also stressed that the United States is "part of the problem (because) there's a tremendous demand in this country for narcotics." President Clinton last Friday recertified Mexico as an ally in the war against drugs despite widespread corruption in the Mexican government. Decertification could have led to U.S. economic sanctions. He praised President Ernesto Zedillo for the arrest of the country's former anti-drug chief, who was charged with taking bribes from drug kingpins, and other Mexican officials. Clinton's action drew strong criticism from Democrats and Republicans. Resolutions to overturn the certification have been introduced in the Senate and are being considered in the House. Clinton could veto such a resolution if it passed Congress and it would then need a two-thirds majority in both chambers to take effect.
GCAT	Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov on Wednesday formally asked Union of Democratic Forces leader Ivan Kostov to form a government, following his coalition's victory in the April 19 parliamentary elections. Kostov, elected on a promise to reform the economy and fight organised crime, said he expected to present his cabinet to Stoyanov on Monday, though the draft list is already known. "Happily the majority of the economic team remains, although modelled in a different way, but it will continue its work so that there will be no problem especially in the economic sphere," Kostov said. He said the ministers would use the time until next week to work on their programmes for the next four years. Muravei Radev, former deputy chairman of the economic committee in the previous parliament, is expected to be the new finance minister, while interim deputy prime minister Alexander Bozhkov is expected to retain the industry portfolio, overseeing the restructuring of the unwieldy state sector. UDF spokeswoman Nadezhda Mihailova is expected to become foreign minister, and interim interior minister Bogomil Bonev will continue his high-profile campaign against organised crime and corruption. Kostov will create a ministry of state administration to oversee reforms promised to reduce bureaucracy and improve the flow of information. The energy ministry will be downgraded to a committee. Parliament is expected to approve the new government on Wednesday. "We will present the programme, we will seek the support of parliament, and with this Bulgaria's political crisis which started on December 21 will probably end well for all of us," Kostov said. One of the first tasks of the new government will be to introduce a currency board, a restrictive fixed exchange rate mechanism intended to improve monetary discipline and stabilise the national currency. An International Monetary Fund mission arrived in Sofia on Tuesday to finalise details of the currency board and the 1997 budget, which has been delayed by the political upheaval. Elections were held 20 months ahead of schedule after mass protests forced out the former Socialist government in February. An interim cabinet led by Sofia's popular UDF mayor Stefan Sofianski has governed since then, tackling bread and fuel shortages and bringing inflation under control.
GCAT	Big crowds in Taiwan greeted the Dalai Lama's "enlightenment" tour on Tuesday while officials were reported to be working on booking meetings between Tibet's exiled spiritual leader and Taiwan's leaders. The Dalai Lama, scorned by Chinese communist authorities as a Tibetan separatist, began the fourth day of his unprecedented Taiwan stay at Fu Jen Catholic University. He then moved to an arena for a marathon inter-denominational gathering of religious groups witnessed by some 20,000 people -- the second of three stadium-sized "enlightenment meetings" on his six-day tour. With less than 48 hours left in Taiwan for the Dalai Lama, who is revered by Tibetan Buddhists as a god-king, officials remained tight-lipped on expected meetings between the 61-year-old monk and Taiwan's top leaders. The Government Information Office said it knew nothing about a report in the United Evening News that Vice President Lien Chan, who doubles as cabinet chief or premier, would dine with the Dalai Lama on Wednesday. "We have received no information," a government spokesman said by telephone. "It is not in the premier's schedule." The newspaper said Lien's appointment with the Dalai Lama was to discuss details of the Tibetan's likely meeting on Thursday with President Lee Teng-hui -- an encounter that communist China has condemned as the collusion of "splittists". Beijing on Tuesday continued a series of attacks, scorning the Dalai Lama's statement the day before that he sought only self-rule for Tibet, not independence from China. "On one side the Dalai Lama publicises internationally the view that he does not want Tibetan independence, on the other side he everywhere engages in activities to split the motherland," Beijing spokesman Cui Tiankai told reporters. "This makes clear he is basically not sincere and has certainly not put aside his stance for so-called Tibetan independence," Cui said. The Dalai Lama has said he hoped to discuss "spiritual reforms" with President Lee, who said he welcomed a meeting. Taiwan officials have refused to comment. Local media said the two would meet on Thursday at the foreign ministry's Taipei Guest House rather than the Presidential Office in a bid to play down the political nature of their first face-to-face encounter. Since his arrival on Saturday, the Dalai Lama is known to have met only a few senior Taiwan officials, including Interior Minister Lin Feng-cheng and Provincial Governor James Soong. He was expected on Wednesday to meet the leader of Taiwan's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, Hsu Hsin-liang. The exiled Republic of China government that has existed only on Taiwan since its 1949 civil war loss of the mainland still maintains that the island should one day reunite with China, though not before Beijing adopts democracy. But Taiwan's democratic reforms since the 1980s have given new voice to open calls for a sovereign Republic of Taiwan. That angers China, which calls Taiwan a rebel-held region that must "reunify with the motherland". The Dalai Lama has tried to play down the political implications of his journey to Taiwan -- his first return to Chinese territory since he and thousands of followers fled Tibet in 1959 after Beijing crushed an anti-Chinese uprising. Despite China's attacks, a Taiwan newspaper poll showed that more than 50 percent of residents support a Dalai-Lee meeting, believing it would help improve Taiwan's relations with the exiled Tibetan government.

ECAT	Bulgarian consumer price inflation for 1997 is seen at 670-700 percent, up from earlier forecasts of 566 percent if monthly inflation topped three percent for each of the last five months, a National Statistics Institute (NSI) official said on Monday. "Cumulative inflation for this year is expected at between 670 and 700 percent if month-on-month price rises remain above three percent between August and December," NSI vice chairman Milcho Mladenov told Reuters. Inflation accelerated to 3.7 percent month-on-month in July from 0.8 percent in June, the NSI said earlier on Monday. Cumulative inflation from January through July stood at 505.6 percent. "Consumer price rises last month were only partly due to the mark's fall against the dollar. But we saw a much wider gap between producer prices of foods and their retail prices," said Mladenov. Milk prices rose 13.2 percent last month, cheese gained 14.1 percent, cooking oil 30.7 percent and fresh fruit 53.8 percent. Consumer price inflation for 1997 was assumed at 566 percent in this year's budget under a currency board system recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to curb inflation and stabilise the economy. Annual inflation for 1996 was 310.8 percent. Under the system, a form of a fixed exchange rate regime, the lev was pegged at 1,000 to the mark as an anchor currency from July 1. The mark fell to 1.839 per dollar on global markets on July 31 from 1.747 on July 1, dragging the lev down against the dollar on the domestic market. -- Anastas Petrov, Sofia Newsroom, (++359-2) 91188
GCAT	Palestinian Minister of Planning Nabil Shaath said in an interview published on Friday that the Middle East could "explode" if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not implement peace agreements. Shaath also told the London-based al-Hayat daily that Arab pressure on Israel, including the threat of withholding diplomatic and trade ties, was an important way of directing Netanyahu towards fulfilling the promises of his predecessors. Asked if the Middle East could stand four years of a Likud government that dragged its feet on peace, Shaath said: "The region will explode in his (Netanyahu's) face from all sides because it can't wait four years and he can't continue for four years to reject the peace process. "This is impossible for the Palestinians, Arabs, Israelis and the international community. The region cannot stand it," said Shaath, who was interviewed in Istanbul where he was attending an economic conference. Israel and the PLO on Friday adjourned until Monday talks on implementing a long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron, negotiators said. Netanyahu, elected in May, put the signed deal on hold, saying changes were needed to enhance security for some 400 Jewish settlers living amid 100,000 Palestinians in Hebron. The right-wing prime minister has dismayed Arabs with his rejection of the principle of trading land for peace and of the idea of a Palestinian state. Arab states, including Israel's only peace partners Egypt and Jordan, hinted at a summit meeting in Cairo in June they could review moves towards normal relations with the Jewish state if it did not make progress in peace talks.
GCAT	Defenseman Steve Smith, a three-time Stanley Cup winner with the Edmonton Oilers, announced his retirement from the Chicago Blackhawks Friday. Smith was a mainstay on the Oilers' defense from 1985 until his trade to Chicago for Dave Manson in 1991. He played for the Blackhawks until this past season, though he was limited to 58 games in the last two seasons. "I appreciate what Smitty added to our club over the last few seasons," Blackhawks coach Craig Hartsburg said. "His leadership will be missed in the locker room, and his presence will be missed on the ice." In his 13-year career, Smith played 702 regular-season games and 134 playoff contests. In the regular season, he had 71 goals, 283 assists and 354 points with exactly 2,000 penalty minutes. He scored 11 playoff goals and added 41 assists for 52 points while tacking on 288 minutes. Smith was a rugged performer and paid the price. With the exception of the lockout-shortened 1994-95 campaign, he never played every game in a season. Despite a standout career as a leader, Smith might best be remembered for shooting the puck off the skate of his own goaltender, Grant Fuhr, to give the Calgary Flames a 3-2 victory over Edmonton in the seventh game of their 1986 playoff series. The game was headed for overtime, but instead the Oilers went home without the Stanley Cup for the only time in a span of five-years.
ECAT	South African Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said on Tuesday that the 1996 current account deficit would be well below the 1995 level of 10 billion rand.   "The deficit for 1996 was well below the 1995 level of 10 billion rand," Stals told reporters at a media briefing. "What is more important is to note that the deficit calculated on a seasonally adjusted annualised basis peaked at about 15 billion rand in the second quarter of 1996, before declining to 8.5 billion rand in the third quarter and to a level less than five billion in the fourth quarter of last year," Stals Said.   He said the net inflow of capital from abroad plunged to below five billion rand in 1996 from about 20 billion in 1995, which he said was not enough to cover the current account deficit over the calender year 1996. "The result was that the relatively low level of official gold and foreign exchange reserves came under some pressure, and a very vulnerable situation was exploited by a number of speculative attacks on the rand," Stals said.
ECAT	Pakistan on Wednesday unveiled plans to narrow its trade gap to $2.33 billion in fiscal 1997/98 (July-June) from $3.37 billion in 1996/97. Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar, announcing the policy for 1997/98 after approval by the cabinet, said exports were to grow 15 percent to $9.575 billion from the year-earlier's $8.26 billion and imports to $11.9 billion from $11.63 billion. "Export-led growth is the cornerstone of this government's economic strategy," he said in a televised speech. "Larger and high value-added exports will not only help improve the balance of payments but will also provide employment opportunities," he said. "To lay the foundations of a robust outward-oriented economy, it is now imperative to reverse the anti-export bias in the economic structure evolved over the last 50 years." He said there would be adequate export finance for small- and medium-sized exporters through commercial banks at lower rates. Dar said 50 percent of the duty drawback to exporters would now be paid within three days of the presentation of documents and the balance after verification of customs authorities. "Machinery (not manufactured locally) imported by engineering units for export-related production (will) be subject to a zero rate of tariff up to 200 percent of the export value during the preceding financial year... "This facility would be available on an annual basis up to 30th June, 2000," he added. Local assemblers and manufacturers of vehicles had been allowed duty-free imports of assembly kits, corresponding to the number of their exported units, Dar said. "There would be no sales tax on imported raw materials, components required for manufacturing goods to be supplied against international tenders," he added. Dar said exporters would also be allowed to import, duty free, textile designs, artwork and transparencies up to 0.5 percent of the value of exports. He also announced duty-free import of raw sugar for further exports after refining. "This would save foreign exchange, utilise idle capacity of sugar mills and result in value addition," Dar added. Pakistan would open up the import of gold and silver, which was now allowed for only three companies, he said. "However, foreign exchange for such imports will be privately arranged by the importer as per existing practice." He said most measures would be effective in a month, hoping the export of non-traditional items would register an increase of $500 million in 1997/98 and the traditional exports based on cotton and textiles to bring an additional $815 million.

GCAT	A leading Russian newspaper on Tuesday questioned the Kremlin's haste in promoting without public debate a treaty creating a union with neighbouring Belarus, reflecting liberal concerns about the pact. "They are deciding the fate of Russia behind the backs of the people," liberal daily Izvestia said in the lead headline of its Tuesday editions. "Was it agreement or conspiracy prepared in the corridors of power?" Under the treaty, expected to be signed on Wednesday, the two ex-Soviet states would remain independent but coordinate their foreign, economic and military policies closely. An updated draft of the treaty obtained by Reuters on Monday night was confusing and left many questions unanswered. President Boris Yeltsin gave the green light to the treaty on Monday, and was expected to sign it on April 3 with his Belarus counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, Russian media reported. Russia, a nuclear state of nearly 150 million people, has been working on forming a "community" with its less wealthy western neighbour of about 10 million under a deal signed by the two leaders on April 2 last year. "There will be a union of two states rather then a single state," Valery Serov, Russia's deputy prime minister who co-authored the treaty, told a news conference. The potential transformation of Russia was rushed so quickly that even Yeltsin's allies complained about the lack of debate. "The government's mistake is that it has rather quickly and secretly worked out the agreement and presented it for ratification," Sergei Belyayev, a leader of the pro-government Russia's Choice fraction of parliament, told NTV commercial television. "That's why there emerged more questions than answers." Even Serov's remarks suggested that Russians were confused about the most basic issues related to the treaty. "Some people are asking: 'In what country will we wake up on April 3?'," Serov said. "The answer is: In the very same country you went to bed." Russia's embrace of Belarus comes at a time of increasing international isolation for Minsk. In recent weeks Belarus has cracked down on political dissent, and last week ordered the expulsion of a U.S. diplomat. It has also tried to limit foreign television reporting. Some Russian liberals said they fear the authoritarian Lukashenko, who has lagged far behind Moscow in economic reform, could gain a slice of power at the Kremlin's expense, posing questions about democracy, stability and human rights. Above all, liberals fear Lukashenko could gain jurisdiction over some decisions affecting Russia under a nine-member Supreme Council which will oversee the Russia-Belarus union. However, previous accords on integration have had few practical implications. The latest plans are ambitious, speaking of a union with a joint legal system, joint running of energy, transport and communications systems and a common customs policy. It would also prepare for introducing a single currency. Yeltsin, 66, believes forging better ties with Belarus is a sure political winner since many Russians are nostalgic for the Soviet Union which fell apart in 1991. It could also deflect some attention from Russia's economic woes. But Kremlin sources said Russian officials haggled over the draft in last-minute talks late on Monday. They said liberals, led by first deputy prime ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov, had tried to prevent Yeltsin's approval of the treaty and that divisions had opened in the government. "If the document needs corrections or more work, it's better to do it without hurrying it, so that mistakes are not made," Nemtsov told NTV on Monday night.

ECAT	Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Saturday Israel's failure to implement its peace promises with the Palestinians had deterred his country's business community from cooperating with the Jewish state. Mubarak, who was speaking at a joint news conference with Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, said the Israeli government must work to create an atmosphere of peace if it wanted its Arab neighbours to normalise relations. Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 but has recently joined a loud chorus of Arab disapproval of the policies implemented by Israel's right wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu was elected on a platform that rejects trading Arab lands for peace -- a principle of a 1991 Madrid peace conference -- and he has infuriated Arabs by lifting a ban on building Jewish settlements on occupied territories. "The state cannot order the people in the private sector to invest with Israel or to normalise relations. It is a question of people's feelings under the current circumstances which depend on the political situation," said Mubarak. "There were joint projects between Egypt and Israel. There was cooperation and visits between businessmen from both sides but these have now been reduced as a result of the (Israeli) policies in place," he added. Egypt hosted the Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference earlier this month, which Israel also attended. The Egyptian president said the EU had an important part to play in the peace process but that the main role still belonged to the United States. Egypt along with other Arab states has welcomed an increase role for Europe in the peace process along with the United States, which is regarded by many in the region as being biased in Israel's favour. Scalfaro said his country supported the principle of trading land for peace. "Italy's role is not just to support President Mubarak in his work towards peace but it is also a role to unify the voice and work of the European Union for the sake of peace," said Scalfaro.
ECAT	Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita said on Wednesday that the central bank's monetary policy is geared to ensuring economic recovery.   He told a news conference that Japan's economy is recovering gradually, with private consumption resuming a gradual recovery after being somewhat sluggish in the summer. "The BOJ's monetary policy is geared to ensuring a firm basis for economic recovery," he said. Matsushita said he expects the government to quickly carry out the "Big Bang" financial reforms unveiled last week. The reforms, put forward by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, are reasonable principles on which to rebuild Japan's markets and financial system to a level where they would be as effective as those in New York and London.   Matsushita said reform of Japan's postal savings system was not contained in the proposals, but a debate on this issue from a broad perspective would be useful. Reform of postal savings, as a public financial system, should be considered in a way in which it would support private-sector finances, and managed so that any changes would not cause confusion in the activities of private financial institutions, he said. Asked if the BOJ intended to continue outright purchases of government bonds, he said the BOJ would continue to watch if such purchases were needed in light of the money supply.   Matsushita said Japan's economic recovery seemed to be becoming solid. "Japan's economy is continuing its gradual recovery, but at the moment, the economic recovery appears to be becoming solid," he said. "We can well expect the economy's cyclical mechanism centring on private-sector demand to strengthen further as the economy moves towards a self-sustainable recovery track. However, we must still make sure this is on the way," he said. He said Japan's industrial output is on an upward trend after moving sideways in the first half of this year. Inventory adjustments in some materials industries are making steady progress, he said. On the demand side, steadiness in machinery orders showed good corporate capital investment. A decline in net exports, which was hindering the economy, had come to a halt, he said. Housing investment remained at a high level, he said. He added that private consumption had recovered and was showing a gradual growth this autumn, centring on durable goods, such as cars, after stalling in the summer due to changeable weather. Matsushita said the pace of improvement in employment levels and a rebound in corporate capital investment, including at small and medium-sized firms, needed to be watched.
CCAT	Air Transportation Holding Co Inc said on Friday that its board of directors declared a $.10 per share special cash dividend, payable June 23, 1997, for shareholders of record June 2. This is a 25 percent increase from the dividend of $0.08 a share paid in 1996, the company said. Air Transportation's merger with Piedmont valued both companies in excess of $54.8 million, the companies said in April when the deal was originally announced. The company was not immediately available for comment. Air Transportation also said the board announced the election of Allison Clark to the board of directors to fill the vacancy created by the death of David Clark.
MCAT	The Bulgarian lev closed at 2,130-2,150 per dollar, unchanged from the morning's 2,120-2,160 but softer from Tuesday's close of 2,000, due to dollar short-covering, dealers said. "Mostly banks whose lev liquidity was boosted by payments on government securities bought dollars for short-covering, keeping pressure on the lev today," one dealer said. Small final clients also bought foreign currency to meet pending payments, traders said.   Banks pared forex positions on Tuesday in anticipation of further lev gains after the local currency advanced to around 2,000 from around 2,500 on Monday amid low dollar demand.

GCAT	The Taleban Islamic movement appealed on Tuesday for international recognition as the new government of Afghanistan and pledged not to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. Acting Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammed Stanakzai told a news conference that the Taleban militia, which seized Kabul from forces loyal to former president Burhanuddin Rabbani on Friday, had written to the United Nations claiming Afghanistan's seat there. He said the Taleban wanted good relations with neighbouring countries and with the United States and invited them to reopen their embassies in Kabul. It asked governments to "secure our embassies in their countries" to prevent members of the former government from "harming our national dignity". "All previous contracts and treaties will continue," Stanakzai said, adding that the Taleban opposed international terrorism. "We don't want to interfere in other countries' affairs or send people from here to create problems in other countries." The Taleban expected reciprocal treatment. The United States and its moderate allies in the Islamic world have long voiced concern about so-called Arab Afghans -- Arab Islamic radicals who came to fight the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s and who have since turned their military expertise against their own governments. Stanakzai, without specifying Arab militants, said the Taleban would punish any "terrorists" who fell into their hands. He said the Islamic militia had set up a six-man interim shura, or council, under Mullah Mohammed Rabbani, to govern Afghanistan until the military situation became clear. Later, the Taleban would invite representatives of the Afghan people from inside and outside the country to decide on a new form of government and rule on such questions as a possible role for former King Zahir Shah or for the Taleban's overall leader and founder Mullah Mohammed Omar. "We do not support or reject the king," he said. "Any time he wants to come to Afghanistan he is welcome. It is up to the people if they want to make him king, or president, or put him before a court." Stanakzai, speaking fluent English, said all Afghanistan's ethnic groups would play their part in the future administration, but only one member of the interim council was not from the Pashtun tribes from which the Taleban have so far drawn most of their support. For now, the priority was to drive forces led by ousted president Rabbani's military chief Ahmad Shah Masood out of their bastion in the Panjsher Valley, northeast of Kabul. "We hope it will be done very soon," he said. Stanakzai said the Taleban had no quarrel with Uzbek leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum, who controls about six northern provinces, and wanted to negotiate a peaceful solution with him. Before the fall of Kabul, the Taleban had not disguised their hatred for Dostum as a former communist. Their fighters now face his troops near the strategic Salang Tunnel, about 90 km (60 miles) north of Kabul. Stanakzai, 37, a graduate of the Kabul military acedemy, said that he, like many of his Taleban comrades, had fought with various mujahideen guerrilla groups against the Soviet occupation. He said interminable fighting among the mujahideen groups after the fall of the communist government in April 1992 had destroyed Afghanistan and dashed hopes for peace, reconstruction and rehabilitation. "So we picked up the arms used against the Russians and started disarming these people," he said of the birth of the Taleban movement.
CCAT	Peru's state mining company Centromin said Monday it had set a minimum price of $8 million for the privatization in December of its polymetallic unit Empresa Minera Yauliyacu SA. Centromin added in a statement that the winner of the auction will also have to invest a minimum of $15 million over five years, as well as assume an additional cost of $4.05 million over two years to treat abandoned deposits. Centromin said it will accept offers for the unit on December 2, and will announce the auction winner on December 6. Yauliyacu, based in the province of Huarochiri, 75 miles (120 km) east of Lima, includes an underground mine and a concentrating plant with capacity to treat 979,000 tonnes of mineral per year. Centromin has said the unit has proven and probable reserves of silver, zinc, lead and copper totalling 7.3 million tonnes. The unit's potential reserves total 14.7 million tonnes. In 1995, 746,000 tonnes of mineral were extracted from the site. Centromin said earlier this month at least eight local and "many" foreign miners were interested in the auction of Yauliyacu. -- Andrew Cawthorne, Lima newsroom, 511 221-2134
MCAT	Czech blue chips posted further losses on the Prague Stock Exchange on Tuesday, as the PX50 index fell 5.0 points, or 0.97 percent, to 508.1. SPT Telecom, CEZ, and Komercni Banka -- the market's three largest shares -- all lost ground, outweighing broader issue gains. Dealers said they saw the decline which started on Monday continuing for the rest of the week as foreign investors were on hold. "Orders from abroad disappeared, investors are waiting for a correction," said Radim Bajgar of ING Barings in Prague. "That is the classic scenario of the Czech market: fast rise and fast fall. It will likely continue for the rest of the week," he told Reuters. Overall on the bourse, 113 issues rose, while 93 fell and 36 held steady.

MCAT	South African three-month deposit rates fell to their lowest levels in almost three months on Thursday as the money market shortage continued to defy month-end pressures. Easier rates have sparked talk of an early interest rate cut. Many money market traders believe this is may be premature, but some say the more stable conditions could pave the way for further moves to ease foreign exchnage controls. Three-month NCD rates were quoted at between 16.90 and 16.95 percent offered -- their lowest level since November 9 -- from 17.05 percent on Wednesday, while the Reserve Bank said the money market shortage eased to 8.49 billion rand on Wednesday from 8.937 billion rand on Tuesday. The fall in the shortage came despite another rise in notes and coins in circulation to 19.948 billion rand from 19.422 billion rand previously. The Reserve Bank has put the lower shortage down to commercial banks selling dollars bank to the central bank. While money market traders agree that these flows are helping, they also cite foreign gilt purchases and an inflow of proceeds from recent Eurorand issues as contributing factors. Chris Doyle, assistant general manager at UAL Merchant Bank Treasury, said the lower shortage was the prime mover behind the fall in short-term rates. "Primarily it is what you are seeing in the shortage," Doyle said. "If you look at the forwards, they are saying it is attractive for foreigners to bring money into the country instead of the local banks to place their dollars offshore. So we are starting to see a reversal of flows," he said. Forward rates continue to fall in line with the easing of money market liquidity pressures. Three-month forward rates are at their lowest levels since mid-October, as are one-year forwards. Traders say that as forward rates play catch-up with the money market, that market is beginning to discount a rate cut. Some money market players feel, however, that such talk is premature. "The market is merely returning to a more stable situation," one trader said. "With call rates still at around 17 percent, it is going to be a while before a Bank rate cut." Bank rate, which was last hiked by one percentage point on November 21 last year, currently stands at 17 percent. Doyle said the return of stability to the markets could herald an easing of exchange controls, rather than lead to a cut in interest rates. "Once we start getting the stability again and our rates are still fairly attractive, that is the time for them to do something on exchange controls," he said. "One of the main problems of doing away with exchange controls is that we get flows out of the country and one way of negating that is if our rates are still fairly attractive. "From that point of view I don't think they are going to start cutting rates yet," Doyle said. -- Johannesburg newsroom, +27 11 482-1003
MCAT	Australian markets, like markets around the world, will be dominated this week by the outcome of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday. There is little of interest locally to distract markets from Fed watching. Wednesday's appearance by new RBA Governor Ian Macfarlane the key scheduled event on the domestic calendar. U.S. Treasuries and U.S. dollar trade was subdued on Friday ahead of the FOMC meeting with traders having either squared up or already taken their positions. The Dow Jones index closed stronger, up 20.72 points, ending three days of losses. Ahead of the FOMC meeting, trade is expected to be cautious. The outcome remains in doubt, with a hike of 25 points seen as the most likely outcome, although many analysts expect any hike to be held over until the November meeting. The local highlight is Wednesday's maiden speech by Ian Macfarlane as RBA govenor. Macfarlane will be appearing in Canberra with ex-RBA head Bernie Fraser and UK Treasury Permanent Secretary Sir Terence Burns on a panel to be chaired by Treasury Secretary Ted Evans. The topic of the panel is "Fiscal and Monetary Policy Indeterdependance and Central Bank Independence," and Macfarlane will delivered a prepared speech. While the U.S. is expected to raise rates, if not this week then in November after the Presedential election, local sentiment still favours another rate cut this year. One data release that may receive greater than usual attention given the market's bullish mood on rates is Thursday's job vacancies data for the three months to August released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). "The ABS's quarterly job vacancy series provides the most statistically reliable guide to future employment growth," Commonwealth Bank economist Tim Moloney said. "To date markets have paid it less attention than they prehaps should," he said. The stalling in the labour market was a key factor behind the RBA's decision to cut rates on July 31, and markets grow more confident of another rate cut with each sign of continuing labour force weakness. The data is expected to show a fall of about five percent, but forecasts range up to a 10 percent fall. Car registrations data for August are due on Friday. Forecasts centre on a rise of 3.9 percent for the month. BONDS: (Friday: 10 year bonds 7.97 percent, 3-year 7.08) Local bonds should start the week on a cautious note ahead of the FOMC, with the potential to continue their recent out-performance of the U.S. market. With the absence of any major local data this week, the market will be focussed on the FOMC meeting. The U.S. bond market has talked about nothing else in the last few weeks as it debated whether the Fed will tighten policy, and in that time local bonds have generally shown a tightening bias on a spread differential basis. The Australian/U.S. 10-year bond yield spread touched its lowest level in over two years last week at 106 basis points. Analysts believe that given Australia's current positive fundamentals it can ride out any storm from the U.S. if the Fed does hike rates on Tuesday. Some economists also believe that a 25 basis point rise in U.S. interest rates may even be taken positively by U.S. Treasuries as it would be seen as a pro-active move by the Fed to contain inflation. "A rate hike would show that the U.S. is very serious about inflation," said State Bank of New South Wales chief economist Hans Kunnen. Such a response would also help the local debt market. "If U.S. bond yields fall, Australian bonds will follow," Kunnen said. "With inflation low in Australia and the economy stalling, bond dealers need little encouragement to buy." AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR: (Friday: US$0.7915/20, NY $0.7912/17) The Australian dollar will start the week above US$0.7900 after holding reasonably steady in New York trade, but it remains vulnerable to the downside after failing to break past resitance at US$0.7950. As with other markets, the lack of domestic data means the major event of the week is the FOMC meeting. If the Fed does hike by 0.25 point it would trim the local dollar's yield advantage and leave it very vulnerable to a possible easing in domestic policy later this year. However, dealers felt that as long as the hike was only 0.25 point, the AUD's yield advantage would still be enough to attract Japanese investor demand and should therefore limit the dollar's downside to US$0.7865 or so. If the Fed restrains itself, there was scope for the currency to re-test 80 cents again, although analysts reckoned world commodity prices were not yet buoyant enough to justify levels much above there. Macfarlane's comments on Wednesday will be dissected for any clues to his stance on monetary policy -- he is thought to be more of a hawk on inflation than his predecessor. AUSTRALIAN STOCKS: (Fri: All Ordinaries 2240.8, down 6.3) Wall Street's 20.72 point rise on Friday, ending three days of losses, should be supportive of local markets, although the All Ordinaries has under-performed the U.S. recently. The All Ordinaries lost 11.5 points over the week to Friday. While the FOMC will also give the local market a lead, metal prices remain the key for the market. "The resources are likely to be the stronger influence over the short term as commodity prices are being watched very closely," one Sydney-based broker said. Copper fell again on Friday, ending under the US$1,900 per tonne support level in LME trade. Aluminium also touched a 2-1/4 year low of US$1,403, and although it managed to end at $1,412, traders said it was likely to fall below US$1,400 soon. BHP chief executive John Prescott said in a weekend tv interview he would not describe himself as bullish on the copper price. "I think it's fallen a bit further than it would have had it not been for (the) Sumitomo incident, but we have to learn in these circumstances to live with lower copper prices for some time and I'd regard any short term spikes as just that." Brokers said lack of local data and the end of the reporting season were seen keeping trade fairly quiet this week. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373 1800

MCAT	Though outright product prices will ride developments in the U.S.-Iraq confrontation, Gulf fundamentals point to stable middle distillate premiums ahead of the fourth quarter, regional traders said on Thursday. Gulf gas oil (diesel) markets have largely shrugged off Indian Oil Corp's (IOC) decision to cancel its November buying tender and are underpinned by tight supplies, low global inventories and Sri Lankan and Kenyan interest, traders said. October 0.5 percent sulphur cargoes were assessed at $1.00-$1.05 to independent price quotations of around $26.25 a barrel on Thursday, compared to only 30 cents last September.   "For October, availabilities are limited," one trader said. Jet markets were less robust, with Saudi material from the Red Sea unsold and looking for a market in the Mediterranean, traders in the Gulf said. In the absence of Indian demand, superior kerosene premiums were assessed at 55-60 cents to jet quotes of $28.80 a barrel fob Gulf, though higher quality cargoes out of Qatar were offered above $1.00. Traders said Saudi Aramco had approached potential term customers for submissions on their 1997 middle distillate and fuel oil contract requirements.   Contract negotiations for the whole range of Aramco refined products are expected to last to the end of this year during a series of meetings in Saudi Arabia, Europe and Asia. IOC is also moving to tie up product supplies with Gulf producers, with IOC officials due in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi this month to settle terms. Many Gulf traders are expecting the fourth quarter to see prices rally as Asian and European heating fuel demand rises. Gulf gas oil prices rallied 35 percent between October and December 1995 on the back of a prolonged cold spell.   Gulf fuel oil and bunkering markets remained at their highest level since April, tracking firm Singapore cargo markets and healthy shipping demand at Fujairah, which has pushed Fujairah 380 cst prices to eight-month highs. -- Steven Swindells, Dubai Newsroom, +971 4 6071255
GCAT	Only 20 percent of the world's major virgin forests remain, almost all of them in the far north of Russia and Canada and in Brazil's Amazon region, the World Resources Institute said on Tuesday. Most of the world's forests in other areas are unhealthy, threatened by logging and development, or too small and fragmented to sustain full biological systems, the environmental organisation said. Russia, Canada and Brazil contain most of the world's frontier forests that are large enough to provide havens for indigenous species and to survive indefinitely without human intervention if protections are put in place now, a study prepared by the group said. The WRI compiled the study by distributing satellite imagery to thousands of forest experts around the world, who assessed forests' health and threatening conditions, WRI president Jonathon Lash said at a briefing. The study also used climate data and other information to gauge the extent of forest cover 8,000 years ago, before human activity started to degrade forest lands. "It is an 8,000-year time-lapse snapshot of the human impact on forests," Lash said. The snapshot showed only three percent of frontier forests remain in the world's temperate regions, making those the most threatened kinds of forests, he said. All of North Africa and the Middle East and nearly all countries in Europe have lost all of their frontier forests, the study said. The continental United States has about 1 percent of its original forest cover, mainly in three combined park and wilderness areas in the northern Rockies and a block of the northern Cascades in Washington. "The question this report begs of society is when is enough enough? Humankind has so far destroyed about four-fifths of the world's natural forests. How much more can we afford to lose?" Nigel Sizer, a WRI associate, said at the briefing. Lash and Sizer said the study shows there still is time to save remaining forests, and cooperation is needed from a relatively small number of countries. "The critical point is that the countries whose forests are in good condition -- Canada, Russia, Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Guyana, Surinam, and French Guiana -- offer a tremendous opportunity for responsible forest management," Sizer said.

GCAT	Ultrasound examinations can detect breast cancer in some women whose dense breasts camouflage the tumours from mammography x-rays, according to a study released on Monday. "It is estimated that mammography misses about 15 percent of cancers in women with dense breasts," New York radiologist Thomas Kolb told the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. "In our study, physician-performed, high-resolution breast ultrasound detected 10 cancers that were missed by mammography in a group of 2,600 women with dense breasts, and detected them at a size and stage comparable to cancers detected by mammography," he said. Of 8,323 women in the study who underwent a mammography exam, 2,600 mostly younger women were identified as having dense breasts and were given an ultrasound exam in which echoes from high-frequency sound waves form an internal picture. The ultrasound exams found breast masses in 195 patients whose growths were undetected by x-rays, 10 of which turned out to be cancerous. "My personal feeling is that all women with dense breasts can benefit from ultrasound," Kolb said. "However, we must look at all the risks and benefits, including costs and long-term effects on survival before recommending implementation of widespread ultrasound screening for women with dense breasts." A typical breast ultrasound exam costs about $150.
ECAT	Portugal cut three official interest rates on Monday in a sign that the government had tightened its grip on inflation, opening the way for further cuts in the repurchase rate in the coming weeks. The Bank of Portugal said it cut its repurchase rate a tenth of a percentage point, or 10 basis points, to 6.90 percent and the draining rate, the rate at which it absorbs excess market liquidity, 40 basis points to 6.40 percent, effective Tuesday. The central bank also cut its emergency lending rate by half a point to 8.50 percent, effective Tuesday, the start of a new seven-day commercial bank reserve period. The Bank's draining rate had stood at 6.8 percent since April 19. The repo rate was last cut on October 21 when the Bank of Portugal shaved a tenth of a point off to 7.0 percent. Analysts had forecast rate cuts, but the drop in the draining rate was larger than the 15- to 30-basis point reduction they had expected. The cut in the repurchase rate was in line with forecasts of 10 to 15 basis points. Better-than-expected inflation figures for October had increased the Bank's room for manoeuvre, analysts said. "Given the good inflation news, the rate cuts were not too surprising," said economist Keith Edmonds of IBJ International in London. In October, inflation dipped 0.1 percent month-on-month, which brought the year-on-year rate to three percent. The 12-month rolling average, the government's benchmark, slipped to 3.2 percent from 3.3 percent in September. Edmonds echoed the views of operators in Lisbon who said the latest rate cuts would probably be followed by further repo rate cuts in the coming weeks. He said he believed the repo rate would drop to around 6.50 percent by the end of this year and that the draining rate could ease again early next year. "The government has shown that it is adopting a restrictive monetary policy and is keeping the exchange rate stable," he said. "Its fiscal policy has also been following a disciplined course," he added. The government's 1997 budget proposals, now being discussed in fine detail by parliament, keep a tight lid on spending and forecast a strong boost to revenues to meet the tough entry test for joining the European single currency in January 1999. The budget is expected to be passed by parliament in a final vote on December 11. Economists said Portugal had shown good progress to reduce inflation. "I don't see inflation as the most difficult target for Portugal to achieve (to join the single currency)," said Sally Wilkinson, an economist with UBS in London. She said the battle to bring the budget deficit to within three percent of Gross Domestic Product to qualify for entry to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) would be tougher. Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said last month that Portugal had room to cut interest rates further and that inflation would be the toughest target to meet for entry to EMU. Portuguese bonds, which had anticipated the rate cuts, traded at all-time highs on Monday, dealers said. Shares on Lisbon bourse failed to react, but dealers said buying interest could increase in coming weeks.
CCAT	The Bank of New York Co Inc said Thursday it has established a direct purchase and sale plan that allows investors to buy depository receipts with reduced brokerage fees.

CCAT	Invacare Corp. on Tuesday refused to drop its hostile $200 million bid for Healthdyne Technologies Inc., rejecting conditions set by the medical device company for potential friendly negotiations. Invacare Chief Executive Malachi Mixon said the Elyria, Ohio-based company will pursue its attempt to oust Healthdyne Technologies' board of directors at the company's annual meeting on July 30. "These conditions are too onerous to accept. Under these conditions, we will stay exactly where we are," Mixon said in a telephone interview. Healthdyne Technologies has repeatedly rejected Invacare's offer. Invacare initially launched a bid in January and has raised it three times to the current offer of $15 per share. On Monday, Healthdyne said it would talk with interested parties about a potential transaction, but set strict conditions for possible talks with Invacare, including a demand that it withdraw its hostile bid before receiving access to confidential financial information. Although several companies have been speculated as potential "white knights" for Healthdyne Technologies, none of them apparently have come forward yet. Mixon said he had not formally notified Healthdyne Technologies about the decision, but intends to do so soon. Healthdyne Technologies stock gained 12.5 cents to $17 on Nasdaq. Invacare shares slipped 37.5 cents to $23.50, also on Nasdaq.

During the first quarter of 1996 a supplementary 1995 budget had been in effect.   The deficit excluding interest charges on public debt rose 29 percent in the first two months of this year to 71.5 billion escudos as a result of increased capital transfers. Current revenue rose 19.9 percent to 731.1 billion escudos while current spending rose 20.6 percent to 802.6 billion. -- Lisbon editorial +(351-1) 3538254

CCAT	Potential bidders for Venezuelan bank Banco de Venezuela, the auction of which was called off on Wednesday, raised doubts on Thursday about the way in which the auction process was being handled. "Banco Santander was not ready to place a bid since there were still a number of outstanding issues concerning the process which had not been resolved," Jaime de Pinies, managing director of Santander Investment, told Reuters in a telephone interview.   Spanish bank Banco Santander and leading Peruvian bank Banco de Credito were the only banks to make a deposit to enter the auction that had been scheduled for Friday. But a top Banco de Credito executive told Reuters the bank subsequently made a decision not to bid because the minimum price of $275 million was too high. Esther de Margulis, president of the state Deposits Guarantee Fund, known as FOGADE, announced on Wednesday that the Banco de Venezuela auction had been called off indefinitely because of confusions about the auction process.   "Due to these conditions FOGADE thinks it will be impossible to carry out a successful auction and has decided to suspend the auction process," she told a news conference. The sale of the bank was thrown off course late last week when a local judge ordered the auction suspended while alleged irregularities were investigated. The same judge reversed her herself on Monday after receiving additional information from FOGADE, but the confusion shook the confidence of potential bidders.   Colombia's Banco Bogota and Germany's Dresdner Bank AG, which had expressed interest in Venezuela's third largest commercial bank, did not even place a deposit to take part in the auction. For Pinies, the successful privatization of Banco de Venezuela, which was taken over by FOGADE in August 1994, "will depend upon the satisfactory resolution of several issues." He did not elaborate. Another Banco de Credito official said the bank had heard the government may now change the terms of the sale, reserving a part of the bank for local investors.   While many in Venezuela complained the $275 million base price set for the bank as too low, the Banco de Credito official said the bank was probably overpriced given the state of Venezuela's economy and its banking sector in particular. The Venezuelan economy is due to record its third year of recession and is the country is grappling with an annual inflation rate of over 112 percent. A banking sector crisis in 1994 and 1995 wiped out over half of the commercial banking sector and cost the state over $10 billion. "To win the bank you're going to have to go into pricey territory. People aren't going to break their backs to get into Venezuela," the Banco de Credito official said. But the perceived risk surrounding investment in Venezuela also makes it an attractive time to enter the country, the official added. "It is a risk, but this is the time to buy into Venezuela because the imperfect scenario actually means you could get assets cheaply," he said. -- Paul Hughes, Caracas newsroom, 582 834405
GCAT	Canadians are experiencing a winter of dismay as their national religion -- ice hockey -- is shaken by sex scandals, fraud trials and the decline of their once dominant teams. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Canada's greatest triumph on ice -- a last-minute victory in a series against the Soviet Union that whipped this placid country into a patriotic frenzy. "It was the one time that we were distinctly Canadian," Paul Henderson, a journeyman player who achieved hockey sainthood for scoring the winning goal in the final game of the 1972 Summit Series, said in a recent interview. But memories of past glory are tempered by fears that Canada is losing its grip on the game. The current season began with the faith-shattering defeat of Canada by the United States in the final of the inaugural World Cup of Hockey. And computer-enhanced pucks that leave bizarre colour trails on television screens, and the NHL's expansion into U.S. markets with little hockey tradition have left purists cringing at the Americanisation of their game. The most disturbing recent blow has been a sex scandal involving young boys and Canada's oldest hockey shrine -- Maple Leaf Gardens, home of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Canadian police have charged two Gardens' employees after uncovering a pedophile ring that allegedly lured teenaged boys to the arena with free tickets and autographs of their hockey heroes. The sordid tale, which may involve up to 60 victims between the late 1960s and early 1990s, has grabbed newspaper headlines across the country. "Maple Leaf Gardens was a sex haven of abused boys, tons of them. They would lay down blankets and they would get us naked and have group sex," one victim, 34-year-old Martin Kruze, has said of the abuse he says started when he was 13. It's not the only sex abuse case to rock hockey this year. Graham James, one of Canada's top junior coaches, pleaded guilty in January to sexually assaulting two players in the 1980s and was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison. James admitted to more than 300 instances of sexual assault over six years against Boston Bruins player Sheldon Kennedy, who was 14 when the assaults began in 1984. Since the James case broke, a minor league hockey coach in Calgary was charged with sexually assaulting a player at a summer camp, and a community club hockey coach in Winnipeg, was suspended after a former player alleged sexual abuse. The revelations hit hard in a nation where it is traditional for parents of boys with pro hockey aspirations to turn their chidren over to the care of junior coaches, often far from home. "The sex cases have made Canadians very uneasy. It speaks directly to this power relationship between adult coaches and the children in hockey," University of Toronto psychologist John Ferudy said. Other criminal cases have also vied for space in the country's sports pages this winter. Former hockey czar and player agent Alan Eagleson, architect of the 1972 matchup between Canada and the Soviet Union, faces fraud and theft charges related to the billing of clients and handling of funds from international tournaments. The game's reputation for thuggery reared its ugly head again with a junior league brawl last month. Police in Halifax, Nova Scotia said criminal charges could soon come against a player who repeatedly punched an unconscious opponent who lay convulsing on the ice. Canada's junior teams still dominate international tournaments, but critics argue their success is due more to a grinding physical style of play than to superior skills. The influx of flashy Europeans into the NHL has also caused some concern in the game's homeland. Canadians now account for just 60 percent of NHL players, down from 76 percent a decade ago and 98 percent in 1968, and a Canadian has not led NHL rookies in scoring since 1988. Meanwhile, the future of Canada's small-market clubs looks grim. With the departure of the Winnipeg and Quebec teams to Phoenix and Denver, only six of the NHL's 26 clubs remain in Canada -- and all but one has a losing record this season. To add further insult, the league's current expansion plans are focused far from hockey's roots in small frozen towns across Canada. Last week, Hamilton, Ontario's bid for an NHL franchise was rejected, while steamy Atlanta appears hot favourite to get the next NHL team. "It's a slap not just in Hamilton's face, but in the face of all Canadians," said Hamilton bid organiser Gabe Macaluso. Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa are struggling to stay alive amid soaring costs. The Ottawa Senators have warned fans to buy more tickets or face losing the team. The Edmonton Oilers, who won five Stanley Cups in the 1980s before selling off their best players, plan to offer shares to the public this spring. "I'm doing this to keep the team here," Oilers' owner Peter Pocklington said. But this supposed effort on behalf of Edmonton will never buy Pocklington's way into hockey heaven. He will forever be loathed for shipping Canadian national treasure Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles.
MCAT	Cocoa futures eased further after Friday's losses to end Monday midsession lower but trading was extremely slow traders said. Traders said there could be some fund selling earlier on. "But volume was not sufficient to put a hand on anything today," said one trader. Further sterling's advance against the German mark could have weighed down on sentiment, traders said. Benchmark September stood 13 stg lower at 1,027 stg a tonne after gapping 10 stg down and well below pre-opening expectations of two or three stg down. It touched an intraday-low of 1,026 stg, the lowest level since July 8. After the immediate floor at 1,024, the contract faces a key support at 1,000. But the upside potential seemed limited. Traders said with New York testing the $1,525-$1,550 area basis September amid negative chart signals, London could be looking at the 1,020 stg region soon. Sterling/mark hit 3.0258, the highest since October 1990 on Monday, amid broad mark weakness before trading nearly 1/2 pfenning lower by midday in London. Sterling's jump also came at the back of persistent expectations of higher UK interest rates. With little supply/demand fundamental inputs, traders said the outlook for the cocoa futures hinged on the direction of the sterling. Volume reached a paltry 793 lots, centred on September contract. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985

MCAT	The Iraqi dinar gained against the U.S. dollar and prices of essential foodstuffs fell slightly, traders and money dealers said on Monday. Iraq's dinar currency soared to 1,550 to the dollar from about 1,780 on Sunday and money dealers are expecting a further surge in the volatile currency. The rise in the value of the dinar has already sent down prices of essential commodities. A kg (2.2 lb) of sugar went down to 700 dinars from 850 on Sunday, a kg of flour was sold at 500, down from 600, and a kg of rice, stable diet of most Iraqis, fetched 500 down from 650. Traders attributed the surge in the value of the dinar to a news report in Iraq's official newspapers on Monday saying that Turkey would double its trade volume with Baghdad. The papers, quoting Turkish officials, said Turkey had expanded a border point with Iraq to handle more trucks loaded with foodstuffs to the sanctions-hit Iraq. Ankara puts its current trade with Baghdad at $122 million but the traders said the figure did not take into account the increasing number of Turkish truckers making the cross-border trip to swap goods for Iraqi diesel. Prior to the U.N. trade sanctions, imposed in 1990 because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Turkey's trade with Iraq reached about $2.5 billion a year. The traders also said they expected early implementation of a delayed oil-for-food deal signed by Iraq and the United Nations. Iraq's oil deal with the United Nations allows oil sales worth $2 billion in six months to buy food and medicine. The pact was about to be implemented in September but was halted when Baghdad sent troops to northern Iraq to help one Kurdish faction fight a rival. Early this year Baghdad's oil talks with the U.N. led to spectacular gains for the dinar. From about 3,000 to the dollar it rose at times to 450.

CCAT	Unison HealthCare Corp on Monday said it expects to report a loss for the third quarter due to costs associated with the disposition of seven underperforming nursing homes. In a statement, the company said it expects to record a one-time, after-tax charge of approximately $2.4 million, or $0.57 per share, in the third quarter ended September 30, 1996. Including the nonrecurring charge, the company said it expects to report a loss in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 a share for the quarter.   Earnings per share before the one-time charge are expected to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.31 per share, including $0.02 per share of operating losses relating to these seven nursing homes. Final results for the third quarter will be reported on or about November 7. The company said the charge is a result of costs related to the anticipated disposition of seven underperforming nursing homes in Texas, Indiana and Kansas and the write-off of certain receivables which are not expected to be collected.
GCAT	Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini has welcomed an initiative by France and Germany to reform the European Union, saying Europe was ready to look beyond purely economic questions to issues that directly affected its people. President Jacques Chirac of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany sent a letter on Monday to fellow EU leaders calling for closer cooperation on police, justice, foreign affairs and defence, and a shakeup of EU institutions. In a statement on Monday, Dini said the letter further convinced him that a consensus was emerging in the bloc to move forward on key institutional reforms, especially following a draft treaty unveiled by Ireland last week. "In the letter, I found echoes of positions we promoted at the (Turin) conference," said Dini, who as prime minister hosted the EU's inter-governmental conference in Turin last March when Italy held the bloc's revolving presidency. "Beyond the single solutions the letter presents, it seems to me that negotiations can now proceed along lines that will attract more and more consensus," he said. EU president Ireland on Thursday unveiled a working paper for an eventual treaty to be approved at an EU summit next June in Amsterdam. The draft is set to be discussed at an EU summit in Dublin on Friday. Dini said much progess could be made between now and the Amsterdam summit. "We can make clearer...aspects of Europe's construction which directly affect citizens, making them part of economic and monetary issues which currently dominate public attention," Dini said.

CCAT	Air Mauritius head Harry Tirvengadum is undecided whether to take up an offer of the post of chief executive of ailing Air Afrique, a Mauritius newspaper said on Wednesday. Tirvengadum, who is Air Mauritius chairman and managing director, was offererd the top job on Monday at a summit in Abidjan of member states of the debt-ridden multinational airline. L'Express said Tirvengadum had told fellow directors of his airline he would have a series of consultations before taking a decision on the Air Afrique job. "Because of his engagements at the regional and international levels, he does not intend to take a decision before the end of the year," L'Express said. Tirvengadum has not responded to a Reuters invitation to comment on his appointment. He was among candidates from a list presented by an international management consultant. Sources at the Abidjan talks said they included a French and a Belgian national. Tirvengadum would replace Frenchman Yves-Roland Billecart, whose mandate at the head of the struggling airline was cut short by the 11 Francophone member states. Billecart's job, chairman and mangaing director, will be split between the new chief executive and a chairman to be chosen at the next meeting of the company's board.

GCAT	BOSTON, June 18 (Reuter - Hormorne treatments for post-menopausal women help them live longer and ward off osteoporosis but the benefits of oestrogen therapy wane after a decade, a New England Journal of Medicine study said. A team of Harvard University researchers also reported in the article to be published on Thursday that the benefits of such treatment may not be as dramatic for women not prone to heart disease. And, adding to the uncertainty, they found the therapy increases the risk of breast or endometrial cancer. The team led by Francine Grodstein tried to get a better assessment of the risks and benefits of hormone therapy using data from the Nurses' Health Study, a project begun in 1976 that tracks information on 121,700 female registered nurses. They found that those who took hormone treatments cut their risk of death by 37 percent compared to those who did not, but after 10 years the benefit was less pronounced. Hormone users were 20 percent less likely to die after a decade of hormone use. The risks also varied depending on a woman's health problems. Those who had several risk factors for heart disease because they suffered from high blood pressure, were obese or smoked saw a 49 percent drop in their death rate if they took hormones, while women who were at low risk for heart disease had only a 13 percent decline in their likelihood of death. When they examined specific causes of death, the Grodstein team found that hormones protected the heart even if the medicine was taken for longer than 10 years. However, after 10 years the death rate for breast cancer was 43 percent higher than it should have been. "Thus, with additional years of use, expected mortality advantages were, in part, offset by the risk of breast cancer," they said. "On average, the survival benefits (of hormone therapy after menopause) appear to outweigh the risk, but the risks and benefits vary depending on existing risk factors and the duration of hormone use and must be carefully considered by each woman." In an editorial in the Journal, Louise Brinton and Catherine Schairer of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the breast cancer threat may not be as great as some women might imagine. "Given that a white woman's cumulative absolute risk of death from the ages of 50 to 94 years has been estimated to be 31 percent from coronary heart disease, 2.8 percent from breast cancer, and 2.8 percent from hip fracture, the benefits of oestrogen use appear to far outweigh the risks," they said. But for women with a low risk of heart disease, they said, "the benefits of hormone therapy may not outweigh the risks." A study on Wednesday in the journal Neurology found that oestrogen treatment may ward off Alzheimer's disease. The study by Johns Hopkins University researchers found women who took oestrogen had a 54 percent lower chance of contracting the disease that attacks the central nervous system and can cause premature mental deterioration. Oestrogen may help prevent Alzheimer's by stimulating the growth of nerve cells, neutralising anti-oxidants that can damage chromosomes or increasing neurotransmitter levels, it said.

CCAT	Swedish tool and speciality metals maker Sandvik on Tuesday said it stood by an earlier forecast of lower profits in 1996 but saw continued good profitability. Posting an 18 percent fall in nine month profit after financial items, Sandvik said adverse currency effects were expected to wipe 200 million crowns ($30.4 million) off fourth quarter profits. ($ = 6.587 Swedish Crowns)   "The forecast for 1996 remains valid: continued high profitability, but lower earnings than in 1995," Sandvik said in its report for the nine months ending September 30, 1996. Sandvik said its profit after financial items fell to 3.54 billion crowns in the period and order intake fell to 20.52 billion crowns from 23.08 billion. It said the primary reason for the decline in earnings for the period was the Swedish crown, whose strengthening at the end of 1995 hit Sandvik's earnings in mid-1996. "The main reason for the decline in earnings was the appreciation of the Swedish crown at the end of 1995, which gained its full impact on Sandvik's earnings as of the middle of 1996," the company said. "The net impact was about a 400 million crown charge during the first nine months of the year. "The net impact for the full year 1996 is estimated at about a 600 million crown charge."
CCAT	The collapse of Barings last year has exposed the weakness of the Bank of England in supervising banks that are rapidly expanding into volatile international security markets, a member of parliament's Treasury Select Committee said on Tuesday. Conservative MP Tim Yeo avoided direct comment on a report the panel will publish on Wednesday into the collapse of Britain's oldest merchant bank under the weight of more than $1 billion in losses chalked up by Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson. But the MP told BBC radio it was clear from the evidence that the all-party committee heard that the central bank's traditional supervisory activity was now "rather stretched" by banks' growing concentration on securities markets. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that the Treasury committee would conclude that there may be a case for an independent banking supervisor. It said there may be a conflict of interest between the Bank of England's ambition to make London the most competitive financial market in the world and its supervisory role. Yeo said the Bank of England's primary duties were to protect the currency and the stability of the financial system. "These are duties which don't lead them directly always to look out for malpractice within any individual bank," he said. Yeo said the Barings affair had also exposed "the difficulty of regulating activities which take place in other markets, and the lack of communication between regulators in one country and another". Britain's banking regulator, he said, should have the necessary powers to liaise with its overseas counterparts. "It would need to be effective at international liaison and be able to pull together all the different activities of the banks, not just lending, but also operating in derivatives markets and a variety of other markets as well. "It needs to be a multi-function regulator. It would have a big job to do. That is why the report is not unduly critical of the Bank of England, because it recognises the difficulties which have been created by the changing activities of banks themselves," Yeo said. The Bank of England said it could not comment as it had not yet seen the committee's report. -- London newsroom 44-171-542 7767
CCAT	ITT Corp. on Wednesday rejected Hilton Hotels Corp.'s unsolicited $6.5 billion takeover offer, saying it was inadequate and not in the best interests of ITT shareholders. The rejection by ITT's board came a day after Hilton expressed its determination to press ahead with its takeover offer of $55 a share for the lodging and gambling company. ITT said in a statement that keeping the company independent would be in the best interests of its shareholders and other constituents, and that it would seek various options to increase the company's value. New York-based ITT also said the Hilton offer did not reflect the inherent value of ITT, which owns and operates Sheraton hotels and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas and Reno, Nev., and Atlantic City, N.J. The statement was apparently in response to Hilton's announcement Tuesday that it might reduce its bid if ITT took measures to reduce the proposed merger's value. "We do not intend to be deterred from pursuing our offer by any actions that you may choose to take," Hilton Chief Executive Stephen Bollenbach said in a letter to ITT Chairman Rand Araskog. Hilton, apparently preparing for a fight to control the ITT board as part of its takeover bid, also on Tuesday named 11 candidates for ITT's current board seats, and named 14 others whom could be added if ITT attempts to thwart Hilton's bid by boosting the number of board members. ITT said Wednesday that it was reviewing various options to increase the value of the company, including "monetizing" or otherwise realising the value of ITT's non-core assets. "The issue is creating shareholder value, both short- and long-term," Araskog said in ITT's statement. "We plan to deploy our financial resources only to those assets that produce superior current and future earnings growth." Araskog said there were "serious business conflicts which have always confronted a (potential) Sheraton/Hilton combination." He said owning and managing multiple hotels under each brand in dozens of the same cities would create material conflicts of interest. As part of its response to Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Hilton's offer, ITT said it was filing counterclaims to litigation Hilton filed against it in a Nevada federal court. ITT said it was seeking to enjoin the offer and other relief because of Hilton's "misappropriation and misuse of confidential ITT information, including information obtained in violation of a 1996 confidentiality agreement between ITT and Bally Entertainment, now part of Hilton." Alternatively, ITT said, it was seeking to compel Hilton to disclose information about its offer required under federal securities laws. ITT's shares closed Tuesday at $56, after rising from the low $40s when Hilton made its offer to acquire the company Jan. 27.

GCAT	O.J. Simpson could take the witness stand on Friday for a second time in his civil trial to tell what he was doing the night his ex-wife and her friend were murdered. But this time, the former football star will face gentler questioning from his own lawyers, compared to the harsh interrogation he received over three days last month at the hands of the plaintiffs' attorneys. Simpson is on the list of defence witnesses for Friday, but the jury was first expected to hear continued testimony from Robert Groden, an expert who alleges a photograph of Simpson apparently wearing the same kind of Italian designer shoes as the killer is a fake. Chemist Fredric Rieders, who specialises in identifying blood DNA, was expected to follow Groden to the stand, after which Simpson could testify as the last witness before the trial goes into recess for a two-week holiday break. But CNN's legal expert, Greta van Susteren, said she thought the plaintiffs would try to drag out the questioning of the prior witnesses in order to prevent Simpson from making a climactic appearance on the stand just before the holidays. "These lawyers are smart and the plaintiffs will want to question Groden and Rieders for as long as possible to preempt Simpson taking the stand on Friday," she said. Simpson was acquitted in October 1995 in criminal court in the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. He is now being sued in a wrongful death civil suit brought by the families of the victims. Simpson, who never testified in his criminal trial, took a verbal battering when called to the stand in November by the victims' lawyers. He sometimes gave statements that contradicted his own sworn deposition and flatly denied ever striking his ex-wife, even when confronted with graphic photographs of a bruised and battered Nicole Brown Simpson. His lawyers chose to delay their own cross-examination, and legal experts suggested this time they would concentrate on addressing specific contradictions, such as how he cut his hand the night of the murders. They will also want to clarify exactly where he was the night of June 12, 1994, when he has said variously he was sleeping, chipping golf balls, walking the dog or showering. "They must clear up the inconsistencies," TV legal analyst Starr Jones told Los Angeles TV station KTLA. Also, Simpson's attorneys will want him to talk about the positive aspects of his relationship with his ex-wife and their children in order to leave jurors with a good impression to carry with them over the Christmas and New Year's holidays, she said. "They must convince the jury that the O.J. they know and love is still there. They will want him to emphasise his relationship with Nicole had its ups and downs and that they both had (other) relationships ... but that he was not obsessive and there was no fuse burning."

In the settlement agreement, Shoney's said it agreed to increase the number of directors to 11 from seven. Schoenbaum and Michael Bodner have been added to the board, it said.   One additional director selected from the Schoenbaum group's slate of nominees will be added within two weeks and a fourth director mutually acceptable to both sides will be added as soon as practicable or within 60 days, it said. Shoneys said it also agreed that new directors will be nominated to the board at the next annual meeting. As part of the settlement, the Schoenbaum group agreed to withdraw its request for a special meeting and terminate its proxy drive, Shoney's said. In addition, the group agreed to a standstil provision prohibiting certain actions, including launching a new proxy contest, until April 30, 1998, subject to certain exceptions, it said.
CCAT	Slovenian petrol distributor Petrol said on Monday its 1996 net profit is expected to be 30 to 40 percent below last year's profit of 2.8 billion tolars ($20 million). "Profit will fall mostly because of low petrol prices.... higher exchange rate of U.S. dollar, and increased prices of crude oil abroad," Franci Percic, deputy executive of Petrol told Reuters. The dollar is currently quoted at 140.4 tolars compared to 129.6 tolars at the beginning of 1996, while the annual retail price inflation rate reached 8.6 percent in November. Petrol prices in Slovenia are among the lowest in Europe with 76.2 tolars ($0.54) per litre of unleaded petrol. In November, the government refused to lift petrol prices by the demanded 11 to 20 percent. Petrol prices were already raised twice this year by about nine percent, but the government said it would consider a significant price increase at the beginning of 1997. In spite of the problems Petrol faced in 1996, it expects turnover to jump eight percent to 103 billion tolars ($735.7 million). "In the next year we plan to invest about 85 million marks (7.7 billion tolars) mostly for construction of petrol stations on newly constructed motorways and for building new petrol depos," Percic added. Petrol, which completed its privatisation process in November, is still 15.63 percent state-owned. Percic said Petrol was most likely to list its shares on the Ljubljana bourse in 1997 but did not provide an exact date. -- Novica Mihajlovic, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439
ECAT	China's first quarter gross domestic product rose 9.4 percent year on year, the State Statistical Bureau said on Friday. It said total GDP reached 1,468.6 billion yuan ($176 billion).   The State Statistical Bureau also said that industrial output during the first quarter rose 11 percent year on year to 452.5 billion yuan. China's economic growth is expected to top 10 percent this year after a solid 9.7 percent rise in 1996. Strong growth has been maintained while keeping inflation at relatively modest levels. The bureau earlier reported that in the first quarter its two key measures of inflation showed their lowest rises for the period since 1992. ($1 = 8.3 Yuan)
ECAT	The Japanese government should review its 630-trillion yen public spending programme which covers a 10-year period, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said on Friday.   "It's a 10-year plan. However, when we are debating fiscal reform, it's natural that we review the contents," Mitsuzuka told a parliamentary finance committee. Mitsuzuka said he wanted a basic policy outline to be worked out by June.

GCAT	London's ethnic minority population will rise 40 percent in the 20 years to 2011 when blacks and Asians will constitute more than half the population in two of the capital's 33 boroughs, research showed on Tuesday. The London Research Centre said that by 2011, 28 percent of London's population of 7.03 million would be from the ethnic minorities, compared with 20 percent in 1991, when 6.90 million people lived there. The Indian population would rise to 452,000 from 362,000, the black Caribbean population to 379,000 from 304,000 and the black African population to 321,000 from 170,000. In Brent, north London, ethnic minorities would make up 52 percent of the population in 2011 compared with 45 percent in 1991. In Newham, an east London borough hit by a number of racist incidents, the black and Asian population would rise to 61 percent in 2011 from 43 percent in 1991. The London Research Centre is subscribed to by all 33 boroughs and claims to be London's leading provider of research on urban affairs.
ECAT	The Italian economy, which slowed to a snail's pace in the first half of last year, grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 1996, the government said Tuesday. The national statistics office Istat said gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.7 percent in the third quarter compared with the 1995 period and 0.6 percent compared with the second quarter. Preliminary data released in November pointed to a 0.5 percent increase in both cases. "The increase in GDP...confirms that the Italian economy is on the road to recovery," Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni said in a statement. GDP measures the output of goods and services within a country's borders. Over the first three quarters of the year, the economy grew 0.9 percent against the same period in 1995, with the construction, agriculture and service sectors all showing gains while the industry sector declined 0.4 percent. Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left government has forecast growth of 0.8 percent for 1996 as a whole and an Istat spokesman described this goal as realistic Tuesday. Early data has pointed to industrial output increasing in both October and November but the final quarter of the year has two fewer working days than the fourth quarter of 1995, which will depress the overall GDP figure. However, Enrico Giovannini, head of the Istat department which compiles GDP data, said the 1996 target could be hit even with around zero growth in the last three months of the year. This would come as a relief to the government, which has repeatedly revised its economic forecasts downwards in the face of faltering industrial production, strong lira gains and stringent Bank of Italy monetary policy at the start of 1996. The economy actually shrank in the second quarter of 1996, as imports tumbled and exports stagnated. But a turnaround came in the third quarter, with imports up 1.1 percent compared with the quarter before and exports up 2 percent. "This inversion of the trend is typical of an economic recovery," Istat's Giovannini said. Prodi's government is sticking to forecasts of 2 percent growth this year but most economists say that is optimistic given the 1997 austerity budget, which was approved by parliament last month and includes a number of tax hikes. Further tough budgetary measures will almost certainly be needed early this year to cover a bigger-than-expected public sector deficit in 1996, due in part to the sluggish economy. The Italian employers' organisation Confindustria and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have predicted growth of 1.2 percent in 1997.
GCAT	Russian Prime Minister Boris Yeltsin and French President Jacques Chirac met on Sunday as planned.

MCAT	The Mexican peso closed weaker across the board on Wednesday after zigzagging through the session ahead of the forthcoming long weekend, traders said. "There was no major news. The peso opened under pressure, but suddenly some banks stepped in to sell dollars and the pressure eased a little," a trader said. "They probably wanted to take advantage of the long weekend and good levels at which to sell this morning," he added, referring to returns available on peso instruments over the forthcoming four-day weekend.   The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate closed 0.5 and 1.8 centavos weaker, respectively, at 7.8950/7.9000 and 7.8910/7.8960 per dollar. Same-day peso contracts had closed earlier 2.2 centavos weaker at 7.8800/7.8930 per dollar. Mexican financial markets will be closed on Thursday and Friday for Easter holidays. Traders said the peso had opened weaker under pressure from the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond, which was down 9/32 to yield 6.99 percent. "It was a strange market. The peso suddenly moderated its slide and ignored the U.S. long bond, even though it was down," another trader said. ((-- Patricia Lezama, Mexico City newsroom +525 728-9555))

ECAT	India's fiscal deficit in the six months of 1996/97 (April-March) totalled 309.05 billion rupees against a target of 622.66 billion for the entire financial year, the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday. "As per the provisional accounts, the fiscal deficit in the first six months up to September 1996 was 309.05 billion rupees which works out to 49.6 percent of the budget estimate figure of 622.66 billion for the year 1996/97," it said in a written reply to a question in the upper house of the parliament. The government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the current fiscal year ending next March 31. In 1995/96 the deficit stood at 5.9 percent of GDP. "Government would endeavour to contain fiscal deficit by maximising revenue and controlling expenditure," the statement said. --New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024
MCAT	U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets early Monday were quiet, with no reported trades or bids following last week's sales, which exhibited some price strength late in the week, feedlot sources said. Owners were pricing cattle at $65.00 per cwt. Packer bids were expected to surface at $62.00, steady with late trade last week. The late sales revived prices from a low on Wednesday of $61.00-$61.50 to end the week at the same level they started, sources noted. Strong packer demand and sharply higher CME live cattle futures lent support late last week, they said.   "I think this is going to be a sit and wait day," one Panhandle feedlot manager said. Several feedlot operators said owners were optimistic that fed cattle prices this week would be steady to firm following last week's sales, which kept most feedlots current. Perceptions that cattle supplies were near a summer peak and would start declining as early as next week also generated outlooks for firm prices, they said. However, price optimism was being tempered by uncertainty over the direction of beef prices this week. Beef movement last week was active but at lower prices, some sources noted.

GCAT	South Africa stung Zambia with two quick goals as they moved a step closer to next year's finals in France with a 3-0 World Cup qualifying win on Sunday. The African champions, seeking their first appearance in the finals, now need to beat Congo in their final qualifier at home next month to make sure of a trip to France. Goals from Helman Mkhalele and Phil Masinga in the first 16 minutes effectively ended the Zambian challenge and their World Cup hopes. Mark Williams added a third after 74 minutes to seal South Africa's victory. Mkhalele gave the home team the perfect start after nine minutes when he was allowed to run at the Zambian defence and fire home from the edge of the penalty area. The winger then turned provider for the second goal  when a deflection landed at Mkhalele's feet and played the perfect square ball for Masinga to tuck away. Zambia fought gallantly for much of the match but were unable to find a way through a South African defence expertly marshalled by captain Lucas Radebe. Andrew Tembo came closest to pulling one back for Zambia but his flying header midway through the second half was just wide. Williams ended the home fans' anxiety with a close-in shot that hit the post before going in for South Africa's third. Teams: South Africa - 1-Andre Arendse; 2-Sizwe Motaung, 9-Neil Tovey, 4-Mark Fish, 19-Lucas Radebe; 21-Eric Tinkler, 10-John Moshoeu (18-John Moeti 70), 15-Doctor Khumalo, 11-Helman Mkhalele (8-Linda Buthelezi 82); 6-Phil Masinga, 17-Shaun Bartlet (13-Mark Williams 54).

MCAT	Swiss shares posted their third consecutive record close which was partially due to merger and spin-off rumours in the financial sector, dealer said. The prospect for low interest rates, a firming tendency in the U.S. dollar and early Wall Street highs also bolsted prices. CS Holding once again took center stage, adding one Swiss franc to 194.25 francs despite trading ex-dividend of four francs. One trader the market was abuzz with rumours about a forthcoming "important statement" from the company. A CS Group spokeswoman, however, said it was company policy not to comment on market rumours. The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) ended up 12.7 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,251.2. and the broad Swiss Performance Index (SPI) added 14.28 points, or 0.43 percent, to 3,327.99. Bourse volume stood at 2.37 billion francs. Demand was also high for major banks SBC and UBS, which both jumped by more that one percent.

GCAT	The trial resumed on Thursday at the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda of former Rwandan mayor Jean Paul Akayesu, accused of genocide in 1994. The hearing, postponed since March 7, began with defence lawyer Patrice Monthe of Cameroon cross-examining expert prosecution witness Allison des Forges, a historian and human rights activist. Des Forges said late Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana exploited an attack by rebels in 1990 as an ethnic issue to unite the Hutu majority against the Tutsi minority and regain popularity. "He had lost a lot of popularity among the Hutu and so he wanted to create the pretext of the attack and blame it on the Tutsi so that he could lead the attack against them," she said. "It was Habyarimana who invented the idea that Hutu and Tutsi were enemies," she told the court. The trial continues. Some 800,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates were slaughtered in a genocide in Rwanda in 1994 by Hutu troops, militiamen and mobs sparked by Habyarimana's assassination when his plane exploded. Monthe apologised to the court at tribunal headquarters in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha for not being present on Wednesday for the scheduled hearing because of flight problems. Akayesu was mayor of Taba commune and has pleaded not guilty to genocide and crimes against humanity. He was the first suspect to go on trial last year at the tribunal, which can impose the maximum penalty of life imprisonment on conviction. The tribunal assigned a Swiss lawyer to defend a Rwandan businessman transferred to detention in Arusha from a Swiss jail to face charges of genocide in 1994. Tribunal officials said no date had been set for the initial appearance by Alfred Musema, who was a tea factory director in Rwanda in 1994 and was flown from Switzerland to Arusha this week. The indictment against Musema, 47, accuses him of bringing armed groups to the area of Bisesero in western Rwanda and directing them to attack Tutsis seeking refuge. It says he himself attacked and killed refugees at Bisesero. Musema came to Switzerland seeking political asylum but was arrested in February 1995 based on information from U.N. investigators. A Swiss court rejected his appeal to stay there. A total of 12 Rwandans are in tribunal detention in Arusha. The tribunal has indicted 21 people. A U.N. inquiry said it was plagued by mismanagement and several officials have been replaced.
ECAT	Mexico's first half government surplus has surged 463 percent to 29 billion pesos compared with the first half of last year, Reforma daily said on Tuesday without citing its source. The figure compares with a government surplus in the year-ago period of 4.2 billion pesos, the paper said. Reforma said the giant surplus was partly due to a 14.5 percent increase in income, which climbed to 243 billion pesos, while expenses rose just 3.3 percent in the first half to 214 billion pesos. In the first six months of 1996, the government earned 172.1 billion pesos and spent 167.9 billion, Reforma said. Mexico's Deputy Finance Minister Martin Werner told Reuters recently that the government would register a fiscal deficit in the second half of the year and would launch more longer-term debt on the domestic market to finance the expected deficit. The Finance Ministry has estimated a deficit of about 0.5 percent of GDP in 1997. ((--Timna Tanners, Mexico City newsroom +525 728-7903))

MCAT	Shortages of platinum and palladium in world markets pushed the white metals' prices higher again Friday, while dealers and manufacturers needing the metal wait for Russian shipments to resume after a five-month suspension. "There is extreme supply tightness, which has virtually brought the physical market to a halt," Refco New York analyst Tim Porter said. "And NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange) futures trade in the metals has been hampered." The shortage forced German catalytic converter maker Degussa AG to warn Friday that production curbs were possible in another three to four weeks if supplies did not improve. Degussa produces about 20 percent of the world's catalytic converters, which are installed on cars to filter pollution from emission systems and typically use platinum or palladium. The supply squeeze is resulting in delivery periods on spot physical transactions being negotiated out to 30 days, instead of the usual two days, to avoid defaults, traders said. NYMEX July platinum jumped $18.30 to $454.90 an ounce after setting a contract high at $473.80. In the physical market, spot platinum was around $465 an ounce at the close, after touching $500, the highest level since 1990. NYMEX June palladium, which expires June 25, rose $13.85 to $214 an ounce after touching $224 an ounce. The more active September palladium contract gained $5.85 to $179 an ounce. In the physical market, spot palladium was around $225 an ounce, after setting a 17-year high earlier this week. Meanwhile, relief was unlikely from South Africa, which produces about 60 percent of the world's platinum. "I don't believe South African producers have stocks of metal," said Barry Davison, the managing director of Amplats, the world's largest supplier. "I don't think relief can come from here. The relief can only come from a resumption of Russian supplies and dis-hoarding of the metal." Russia produces about 20 percent of the world's platinum and about 60 percent of its palladium. The German bank Dresdner called on the U.S. Defence Stockpile to release some of the 431,000 ounces of platinum and the 1.3 million ounces of palladium it holds. But the stockpile's manager, Peter Roman, said on Thursday that congressional approval was needed for another sale and it could not be obtained before the end of summer. Earlier this year, the stockpile sold 10,000 ounces of platinum and 15,000 ounces of palladium from the U.S. strategic reserve. Russian officials told Japanese traders on Wednesday that Russian platinum and palladium exports would resume June 20, but Friday the head of the precious metals division of Russia's Finance Ministry warned that exports to Japan in 1997 would be a little below the levels seen last year. The supply squeeze has been exacerbated by hedge fund accumulation of the metal, analysts said. New York-based Tiger Management is believed to have acquired a stockpile of about 1.5 million ounces of palladium, representing about 20 percent of 1996 world supply.

CCAT	Shares in First South African Foods Ltd dipped on Wednesday as profit-takers moved out of the share after the group's roaring bourse debut on Tuesday, dealers said. "It is just off on some profit-taking after a very stong first day," one dealer said. First Food dropped 15 cents to 340 cents in volumes of more than 430,000 shares. The firm, which had been offered at an issue price of 200 cents, had surged as high as 375 cents on its first day's trading as dealers poured into the stock. The initial share rise had been so marked because the public offer had been limited with the majority of shares being retained by holding firm First South Africa Holdings (FSAH), management or offered to institutions in a private placing. The firm, which invests in niched food manufacturing operations, aims to use the cash raised in the flotation to pursue a number of expansion opportunities. First Food owns four operating companies, namely Piemans Pantry, Astoria Bakery, Seemann's Quality Meat Products and Gull Food. FSAH is a sibling of Nasdaq-quoted firm First South Africa Corp . -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003
ECAT	Mexico plans to pre-pay $1 billion of some $12 billion that it still owes the International Monetary Fund from its emergency loan to Mexico following the 1994 peso crash, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said on Friday. Ortiz told Mexico City's Radio Red radio station that Mexico will also pay an additional $1 billion of the IMF loan that matures next year.  "We owe about $12 billion. We pre-paid $1 billion this year, we will probably prepay another $1 billion next year, and another billion comes due. Therefore, we should end next year owing about $10 billion."   Ortiz said the amount of money in a new three-year IMF loan program being negotiated could reach $6 billion. "We have still not set an amount. But we'd be probably be talking about $6 billion, something like that," he said. He said talks with the IMF on the program could start early next year. "We are in no hurry. It is not like last year, when our backs were up against the wall." He said the money would serve as a backup for future debt payments, but added he did not see any trouble for Mexico in meeting its obligations as it continues to be able to tap international debt markets. "This is not new debt ... it is a program whereby we would use the money only if necessary," he said. "In knowing that we have money if we need it, the markets should be calm," he added. -- David Luhnow, Mexico City newsroom 525 7289565

CCAT	Revenues of China's railways soared by 20 percent last year although the number of passengers declined, the official Xinhua news agency said on Thursday. Revenues could continue to rise this year, spurred partly by huge fare increases, but the number of travellers on the sprawling rail network was expected to decline further, it said. Rail transport generated revenues of 75.6 billion yuan ($9.1 billion) last year, up by nearly 20 percent compared with 1995, it said. The figure is expected to rise to 78.5 billion yuan ($8.8 billlion) in 1997, Xinhua said. Xinhua attributed the increase in revenues to a fare hikje of nearly 50 percent last year. However, the number of passengers was falling, with China's trains carrying 942 million passengers in 1996, down by 12.3 percent from 1995, it said. More Chinese were choosing to travel by air, bus or waterways because these were either faster or cheaper. About 920 million people would travel by rail in 1997, Xinhua quoted figures issued by the Railway Minstry as showing. Rail freight was expected to be 1.61-1.62 billion tonnes in 1997, compared to 1.62 billion tonnes in 1996, a rise of 1.4 percent compared with the previous year, it said.

CCAT	Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) managing director David Murray, buoyant after a surprisingly strong profit result, said on Thursday that CBA had decided to expand its presence in Asia and New Zealand. Murray also said CBA had submitted a first-round non-binding bid to buy Axiom Funds Mangement, which manages A$17 billion of funds and is being sold by the New South Wales state government.   "We've already expanded our presence in Asia and we're about to start our joint venture bank in Indonesia, but I think there's more up there for us to do and we've decided to seek out some fresh opportunities," Murray told reporters after addressing a Securities Institute function. "Our focus has been Indonesia, China, Vietnam and India because they are countries whose financial systems are still evolving because the Australian system, which is one we know very well, is quite mature," he said.   "We're looking in each of those countries for joint venture opportunities," he said, adding such joint venture arrangements would not require significant capital injections from CBA. CBA announced an 11 percent rise in net profit for the six months to December 31 to A$602 million and increased its interim dividend by seven cents to 45 cents per share. The result was well above expectations and fired a four percent rally in CBA's share price to A$13.90. The stock closed up two cents at A$13.93 on Thursday as the overall market rallied another one percent to an all-time high.   Murray said CBA was looking to diversify and expand in New Zealand as well as Asia, and was examining acquisition opportunities and the potential for organic growth of its ASB Bank unit there. He said CBA had been successful in New Zealand with ASB Bank, but that it still had only a relatively small presence. "So if we had any opportunities to expand any further, we'd like to take them, because we know the market and we think we could provide a pretty good service there," he said.   Murray agreed that the only large bank in New Zealand not already owned by CBA or its Australian competitors was the National Bank of New Zealand Ltd, which is owned by Lloyds TSB Group Plc. Murray said CBA had enough capital on hand to handle routine expansion and therefore would continue with its current high dividend payout ratio. CBA would go back to shareholders either to adjust its dividend payout ratio or to raise capital through a share issue if it wanted to make a larger than routine acquisition, Murray said. He would not specify how big a war-chest CBA had.   Meanwhile, Murray said the squeeze in home loan margins from about 300 basis points early last year to about 150 basis points now may have reached its limit. CBA stunned the home lending market on Wednesday when it cut its key variable home mortgage rate to 7.55 percent from 8.25 percent, its second unilateral rate cut in less than a year. A similar sized unilateral cut in May last year was seen as the catalyst to a significant cut in big bank home loan margins. "We're either at or fast approaching a margin which is very competitive in world terms for home mortgages," Murray told reporters.   "I therefore believe that the process from here will be incremental." Murray also took the opportunity to dismiss speculation that CBA was about to securitise its entire home loan portfolio and return the then un-necessary capital to shareholders. He said the global trend  mutual funds would increase the pressure for funding mortgages through securitisation. "This does not mean that we are going to run out tomorrow and securitise our whole home loan book because there is not enough buyers out there and enough funds to take it because of their asset allocations," he said.   -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
MCAT	The FTSE 100 is expected to open 15-20 points up after the Dow closed stronger, dealers said. The key U.S. index ended 58.35 points up at 7,777.06. Massive open interest in index derivatives is set to create intense volatility in the cash market ahead of midmorning expiry. "This is going to be the expiry of a lifetime," said one senior derivatives trader. "There are going to be billions flying around. It's going to be a really rocky ride," he said. Dealers expect the market to sink after expiry as positions are unwound.

GCAT	Inter Milan, declaring Ajax to be "seriously at fault", said on Thursday they would ask a FIFA legal commission to resolve a row with the Dutch club over Nigerian international Nwankwo Kanu. The 20-year-old star of the Nigerian team that won the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta was signed by Inter in the close season for a fee of around $2 million but was then diagnosed with a life-threatening heart defect. Kanu has not played a single league match for the Italian club after Inter's doctors discovered the problem. FIFA's medical commission said in a statement on Wednesday that they had found no irregularities in the transfer and maintained that Inter were responsible for establishing a player's health before they completed the contract. Inter, who have tried to get the transfer and the Nigerian striker's contract made void because of his condition, disagreed in a strongly-worded statement. They said media reports that FIFA had ruled against them were incorrect because a formal complaint had yet to be presented to FIFA's legal commission. "Inter is convinced that Ajax is seriously at fault, towards both us and the player who as an extremely young man was entrusted to the professionalism and seriousness of the Dutch club," the statement said. "However, after trying in vain to come to a fair solution with Ajax, and considering the Dutch club's totally closed attitude, Inter now intends to go to FIFA's legal affairs commission," the statement added. Inter said it had not previously gone to the commission because it believed the priority was to help Kanu and to set up a programme of visits with leading specialists. Kanu, who has said he is "emotionally shattered" by what could be the end of his career, is reportedly to undergo surgery in the United States next week.
ECAT	The Bank of Namibia said on Wednesday efforts to build the country's manufacturing sectors needed to be encouraged to spur economic growth. "Economic growth patterns continue to be dictated by primary production and particularly weather conditions", the bank said in its 1996 annual report released on Wednesday. It quoted the country's drought and reduced fish stocks as the main reasons for the the country's poor economic performance last year. Namibia's real GDP expanded by only 2.6 percent in 1996, well below the five percent target set by the First National Development Plan (NDP1). In 1994 and 1995 the economy grew by 6.2 and 5.2 percent respectively. Slower economic growth in 1996 was due mainly to declines in secondary industries, particularly the manufacturing sector, which is dominated by fish and meat processing. Fish manufacturing output, which is directly dependent on quota allocations for pilchards, shrank by 43 percent last year with a halving of the Total Allowable Catch. Meat manufacturing output increased by 2.5 percent, supported by the increase in cattle sales due to the drought. The bank said government efforts to lessen dependency on agriculture and fishing, and to diversify the manufacturing sector should be encouraged. "The bank fully supports the EPZ (Economic Processing Zone) concept and has made several concessions with respect to exchange control regulations to facilitate the smooth implementation of this programme," the report said. In the absence of an offshore banking act the Bank of Namibia made provision for special banking facilities for EPZ enterprises to facilitate foreign currency disbursements and local investments. -- Windhoek Newsroom +2646 1 245-260

GCAT	U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday condemned the shooting of seven Israeli schoolchildren by a Jordanian soldier as "inexcusable and tragic," and appealed for calm in the region. But Clinton said there was no evidence that "this terrible incident is related to the tensions in the area over the issues. For all we know this may have been just a deranged person." "There is no reason to believe this was politically motivated," Clinton said before boarding a helicopter at the White House on his way to North Carolina. He was reacting to a Jordanian soldier's killing of seven Israeli schoolgirls who were on an outing to a Israeli-Jordanian border site called "The Island of Peace." "Today along the normally peaceful border between Israel and Jordan, we have seen an inexcusable and tragic act of violence against schoolchildren. I condemn this act in the strongest possible terms," Clinton said. White House officials said recent turmoil in the Middle East peace process may prompt Jordan's King Hussein to cancel a trip to see Clinton at the White House next Tuesday. The king in recent days has warned the peace process may be sliding "towards an abyss of bloodshed brought about by fear and despair." Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met Clinton on Monday and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat the week before. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Clinton on Feb. 13. White House spokesman David Johnson said U.S. officials had seen reports that the king may not be coming and they were trying to verify them. An aide to the king told Israel Radio that Hussein would delay his visit to the United States. Clinton said no one should jump to any conclusions about the shooting "given King Hussein and Jordan's long record of reaching for peace and reconciliation." "We don't have the facts. None of us have any facts other than we know this incident has occurred," Clinton said. "But we have no reason to believe this was politically motivated by any larger group or anything. We just don't know that." He urged leaders in the region to redouble their efforts for peace. "Now the leaders in the region must work hard to calm the situation to do everything in their power to create an atmosphere in which violence is rejected, rather than embraced. We call on the leaders of the people of the region to reject violence, to redouble their efforts toward peace and reconciliation," he said.
GCAT	Israel, fearful of more bombings after last week's suicide blasts, was on heightened security alert on Sunday as the deadline passed for an Islamic militant ultimatum. Police said they were taking every precaution as tension rose in the light of a demand that Israel free all Palestinian prisoners by 9 p.m. (1800 GMT). Shortly before the deadline passed, police reported that a Palestinian was found shot dead near Carmel Jewish settlement in the West Bank, not far from Hebron. The circumstances of the man's death were not clear. Palestinians said he was shot by a Jewish settler in a passing car. Police said they had two separate reports from the area: of shots fired by unidentified gunmen in a car and a body found. "We don't know if there is a connection," a police spokeswoman said. The demand for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners was made in a leaflet claiming Wednesday's double suicide bombing, which killed 13 people and wounded 170, in the name of the Islamic militant Hamas group. Some Israeli and Palestinian officials voiced doubts, however, about the leaflet's authenticity. Israel announced no plans to free anyone. The leaflet did not spell out what would happen if the ultimatum was refused. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet that Israel would not honour peace deals it signed with Yasser Arafat unless the Palestinian leader cracked down on militants. "If Arafat honours his commitments in the agreement, chiefly to fight terrorism, the agreement will survive. If he doesn't, we will not keep up our part of the bargain unequivocally," an official statement quoted Netanyahu as saying. He later told CBS-TV's "Face the Nation": "The whole peace is at stake. Arafat must make a choice and make it now." But top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, in an interview on CNN television network, said Arafat had offered to join Netanyahu in fighting militants and had been spurned. "Mr Netanyahu, instead of accepting President Arafat's offer to join him in fighting terror and the enemies of peace, he declared a series of collective punishment measures against the Palestinian people," Erekat said. Israeli U.N. Ambassador-designate Dore Gold, with Erekat in the studio, asked if Netanyahu had spurned Arafat's offer, said: "Well, I don't think that's exactly correct". Gold did not elaborate but said that prior to the attack on Wednesday, Palestinian security officials were making cooperation in the fight against militants conditional on Israel making "certain tangible concessions". Palestinians have demanded Israel halt Jewish settlement of occupied Arab lands which they say pre-empts peace talks. Troops overnight arrested another 37 Palestinians in the West Bank suspected of involvement in Islamic militant groups, bringing to 116 the number arrested since the bombing in the main Jewish street market. Israeli Police Commissioner Assaf Hefetz, asked if Israel had specific information about more attacks, told army radio: "It's more than just an estimate. We have a series of...details that point to this possibility." He said after four days of investigation, officials were still uncertain who carried out Wednesday's attack. Thousands of Israeli police guarded shopping malls, bus stations and other places where crowds gather in Israel's main cities, and stopped cars for inspection along key roads. The suicide bombing revived memories of a bombing spree last year in which Islamic miliants struck four times in nine days, killing 57 people. Israel suspended already dormant peace talks with the Palestinians as a result of Wednesday's bombing and sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip, barring tens of thousands of Palestinians from reaching their jobs in the Jewish state. Palestinians accused Israel of imposing collective punishment on Palestinians and expressed hope U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, due later this week on another mediation mission, could put peacemaking back on track. U.S. Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox Television he backed Israel taking action if necessary on Palestinian territory and condemned Arafat for not fighting militants. Top Israeli security officials met their Palestinian counterparts overnight to discuss the investigation into Wednesday's bombing, security sources said. But Jibril al-Rajoub, the head of the Palestinian preventive security in the West Bank, said the meetings did not constitute a renewal of security cooperation. Arafat is to go to Jordan on Monday for talks with King Hussein on the deepening crisis, his office said. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy's office said he would go to Egypt on Tuesday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak.
GCAT	By Nicholas Doughty, Diplomatic Correspondent The United States and Russia prepared for their toughest summit since the end of the Cold War on Wednesday, with both sides staking out resolute positions in the row over NATO enlargement. A senior Russian official said Moscow would not drop its bitter opposition to NATO's enlargement plans, after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright vowed the alliance would not be deterred from taking in former Soviet bloc states. Seen as the most difficult challenge for European security in the 21st century, NATO enlargement tops the agenda for the meeting on Thursday and Friday between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Helsinki. It now seems unlikely there will be an agreement on this in Helsinki, although Russian and U.S. officials are suggesting there could be progress in other areas, including arms control and economic issues that are of profound concern to Moscow. Yeltsin's decisive shift towards youthful reformers in this week's cabinet reshuffle, no doubt well-timed for the summit, has won lavish praise from Washington and could open the way for more Western help with the economy. Both sides have staked out their positions on NATO, in a sometimes confusing game of diplomatic poker which mixes the usual tough bargaining with hints of possible compromise. Moscow says enlargement will isolate Russia, although Yeltsin does not want a return to Cold War-style tensions. At a Madrid summit in July, the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) will invite some former Soviet bloc states to start membership talks, probably Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The intention is that they join in 1999. "Russia's approach to NATO expansion will not change regardless of any summits, bilateral meetings and negotiations," Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told reporters in the Finnish capital on Wednesday, where snow had begun to fall. "From our side we will, up to the last minute, insist on our right to a negative approach to this plan," he said. But he also said the summit offered the chance to "lay down an outline for Russian-American partnership in the 21st century" and praised NATO for showing signs of understanding Russia's security concerns about its former Cold War foe. "We express very careful optimism," Yastrzhembsky said. Washington has taken a similar approach. Taking a hard line, Albright said on Tuesday NATO enlargement would go ahead on schedule and Moscow would not be allowed to prevent more countries joining in future, although it would have a voice in European security affairs. Clinton said there was a "tough agenda" but he was optimistic. The leaders, meeting for the 11th time, have a good working relationship although they have not held talks for almost a year. "We never had a meeting that didn't result in constructive progress," Clinton said Tuesday. Yeltsin, on fighting form after months of illness and last year's heart surgery, has made fun of the fact that Clinton will be the obvious invalid in Helsinki, either in a wheelchair or on crutches following surgery for a knee injury last week. Yeltsin must be careful not to appear weak in front of his communist and nationalist critics, who dominate Russia's parliament, the Duma. Clinton, on the other hand, wants to demonstrate U.S. leadership by winning Russia over on NATO. Russia wants legally binding commitments in the NATO relationship, including guarantees that allied troops and nuclear arms will not be deployed in new member states. NATO is offering Russia a new relationship through a special charter, which would give Moscow the right to consultation on security issues but no power of veto over the alliance's plans. There are also problems with arms control, which is intimately linked with the NATO issue and with Russia's perception that it is faced by potential enemies. Yeltsin and Clinton will discuss changes to a landmark 1990 treaty on conventional forces in Europe and the deadlock over nuclear weapons.
GCAT	Gay groups expressed regret on Saturday that President Bill Clinton, acting in the dead of night, signed legislation into law that gives states the right not to recognise same-sex marriages. Clinton put his signature to the law at 12:50 a.m. EDT (0450 GMT) at the White House, then went to bed upon his return from a four-day, cross-country campaign swing. Separately, Clinton praised the Republican Congress for moving toward approving a guarantee of longer hospital stays for new mothers and requiring more equitable treatment of mental-health benefits under private health insurance plans. In a written statement issued on Friday night during a campaign stop in South Dakota, the president said he was signing the same-sex legislation because he has "long opposed governmental recognition of same-gender marriages, and this legislation is consistent with that position." But the White House made clear Clinton felt the legislation was produced by Republicans trying to make gay rights an election-year issue. "We think this bill is completely politically motivated and completely unnecessary," said deputy press secretary Mary Ellen Glynn. The Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest national lesbian and gay political organisation, was relatively restrained in its criticism. "We regret that Clinton opted to sign this needless and mean-spirited bill," said the group's executive director, Elizabeth Birch. "We had hoped that the president would have changed his mind after hearing the anti-gay rhetoric spouted by some extreme members of Congress." Steve Michael, president of the local Washington chapter of the national AIDS activist group ACT UP, blasted Clinton's decision and said it would cost him the votes of gay and lesbian voters in the Nov. 5 election. "It is clear by his middle of the night stealth vote that Clinton knows what he is doing is wrong," Michael said. "We will remember his betrayal on Nov. 5." The bill, approved by the Senate earlier this month and by the House in July, was passed out of fear that a pending court case in Hawaii would set a precedent for legalising gay and lesbian marriages. No state legally recognises marriage between two people of the same sex. The law recognises each state's right to determine its own policy with respect to same-sex marriages and clarifies for purposes of federal law that a marriage is between a man and a woman. "With the stroke of his pen, he has condoned the exclusion of all lesbian and gay Americans from the federal benefits and responsibilities that come with marriage, even though it will be years before such an institution becomes available to them," Birch said. Gays overwhelmingly supported Clinton's election in 1992. The Clinton campaign believes they will still back him this year since the new law does not take away any current gay rights and since same-sex marriages has not been a top priority for the gay community. In his weekly radio address, Clinton sought election-year credit for legislation moving in Congress to extend hospital stays for new mothers and expand insurance coverage for mental health patients. House and Senate negotiators approved the plans on Thursday and final enactment could come next week. "I will sign it with enthusiasm," Clinton said in his weekly radio address. The longer hospital stays for new mothers -- 48 hours for normal deliveries, 96 hours for Caesarean sections -- were driven by complaints from many families that insurance companies will only pay for a woman to remain in the hospital for 24 hours after giving birth. The mental health provision would require insurance companies to provide much more generous spending benefits for people suffering from serious mental illnesses. Businesses had opposed the provisions.

MCAT	The FTSE 100 index will lack sufficient pace to take it above 4,675 on the upside, technical analysts said. Aggressive strides to higher levels, expected earlier in the week have now developed into a plod after a restrained performance by the gilts market, they added. "With Wall Street being similarly held back as well as a long weekend to follow, the envoronment is not one in which the FTSE can easily romp ahead," said one analyst. By 0731 GMT, the FTSE was up 1.7 at 4,653.5.   Turnover in UK equities is likely to tail off later in the day as investor attention focuses more on the forthcoming three day holiday weekend. But in the meantime, the fact that the FTSE has managed to make higher intra-day lows over the past three days offers hope to market bulls that at least 4,620 is a reasonably secure support area for the short-term. "It may have difficulty going too far above its 10 day moving average and the market could fall back a little if this is not successfully overcome," one analyst said. On Thursday, the FTSE's 10 day moving average was at 4,660.   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 32.56 at 7,258.13 on Thursday. -- Pradip Mishra, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7954
ECAT	British exporters, battered by the strength of sterling, are less confident than at any time since October 1993, courier company DHL said on Monday. DHL's quarterly export indicator showed the downturn in confidence started last summer when the pound started to soar. It has now risen by about 17 percent since August 1996, pushing export prices higher as it has climbed. "Exporters are expressing grave concern at the effect of sterling's strength on both short-term and long-term business prospects," Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export said. The survey found two-thirds of exporters said exchange rates will have a negative impact on sales in the next three months. Given that the last nine months has showed graphically how currency volatility can hurt exporters, it is perhaps not surprising that DHL's survey showed almost 60 percent of the 800 exporters it talked to favour British membership of a single European currency. Some 58 percent said joining European economic and monetary union would help them. In November, only 54 percent took that line. DHL said larger companies were much keener on Britain joining EMU that smaller ones. Campbell said industry had broadly welcomed Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's decision to grant the Bank of England independence to set interest rates. But he said the new monetary committee must take a global view. "Recent history indicates the Bank would have preferred rates to be raised sooner, and to higher levels," he said. "If maintained, this myopic view does not bode well for the exchange rate in the short-term. The new monetary committee needs to take a global perspective." In terms of Britain's global trade standing, DHL, its main owners flagcarriers Lufthansa and JAL, said exporters rate both China and Taiwan as more powerful in world markets. Britain is seen on a par with South Korea but ahead of Italy and France. -- Mike Peacock, London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109
CCAT	India will allow the Surface Transport Ministry to take decisions independently on all road projects involving investment of up to two billion rupees ($56 million), a government spokesman said on Thursday. "The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure (CCI) met on Wednesday and decided to give more power to the Surface Transport Ministry," the spokesman told a news conference. Earlier, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs and the Public Investment Board had to clear projects worth more than 500 million rupees, he said. He said the CCI also decided to allow the Surface Transport Ministry to independently decide on projects with investment between two billion and five billion rupees in consultation with the Finance Ministry's expenditure department. The committee also gave preliminary approval to providing traffic guarantees to investors and lenders in build-operate-transfer highway projects, the spokesman said. He said it also approved in principle the National Highway Authority of India's plan to issue road bonds. The CCI also approved in principle offers from Malaysian and Singapore-based firms to develop specific sections of national highways, and will fix certain conditions to toll rates at a later date, the government spokesman said. He said the committee also decided to allow the import of bitumen multigrade coal, for which the rate of duty would later be fixed by the Finance Ministry. The spokesman said the CCI asked the Surface Transport Ministry to frame guidelines and principles for allowing Indian ports to form joint ventures with modern ports abroad. The committee expressed concerns about productivity in infrastructure industries and asked administrative ministries to take steps to achieve growth rates, the spokesman said. It set annual growth targets of seven percent for power, 6.4 percent for coal, 3.5 percent for petroleum, 10 percent for fertilisers, nine percent for export cargo, 25 percent for telecommunications and seven perccent for revenue on railway goods, he added. The committee will fix the target for saleable steel in September, he said. --New Delhi newsroom +91 11 301 2024
ECAT	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin Wednesday lauded the state of the global economy, saying it was in better shape than it has been in a long time. In remarks before the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Rubin said "the fundamentals of the world economy look as solid as they've been for a long, long time." He said America too was enjoying solid growth with low inflation. "I believe that if we continue to follow the right policy path in this country, we can have solid growth and low inflation on balance over the long term."   Rubin told the gathering of 181 countries that much of the success in the recent period reflected what is now a widespread consensus on the best economic policies to follow. "That consensus is to open markets, not close them, free business to compete, not restrain them, reduce deficits, not sustain them, and invest publicly in people, infrastructure and other areas critical to future productivity," he said. He said the U.S. was committed to meeting its financial responsibilities to the multilateral lending organizations and pledged the administration's "fullest and upmost effort" to work with Congress to achieve that.   Rubin praised World Bank President James Wolfensohn and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus for "lifting the fight against corruption to the top of the agenda." He called corruption a major impediment to economic development. Rubin also urged the IMF and Bank to work together to help shore up banking systems in emerging market economies, saying that too often banking problems undermine economic growth.

GCAT	Australia's Mark Woodforde, a losing semifinalist at the Australian Open last year, cheered the home crowd on Thursday with an impressive 6-0 6-1 7-5 win over Argentina's Hernan Gumy. The 31-year-old from Adelaide, who with doubles partner Todd Woodbridge has won just about every honour in the game, served powerfully to blast Gumy out of the tournament in just 99 minutes. Only in the final set did Gumy put up much of a defence, but Woodforde managed to break his serve in the 12th game to take the match. The win earned Woodforde a probable third round berth against world number one Sampras, who was later to meet Adrian Voinea of Romania. Woodforde and Woodbridge last year won 12 doubles titles from 13 finals including a fourth consecutive Wimbledon. They also took gold at the Atlanta Olympics. Both have recently come into their own as singles players. Woodbridge won his first tour event in Adelaide earlier this month and on Tuesday he beat France's Stephane Simian in straight sets to earn a third-round tie with MaliVai Washington of the United States.
GCAT	The United Nations and Bosnian Serb police will start joint patrols in a village where a Serb mob attacked Moslems preparing housing for resettlement in Serb territory, Western officials said on Tuesday. At least three Moslems were injured on Sunday by a mob as they tried to begin building teporary homes in the war-battered village of Gajevi, on the Serb side of the ethnic boundary line between Bosnia's Serb and Moslem-Croat territories. Carl Bildt, the international high representative to Bosnia, deplored the incident and held an urgent meeting with Biljana Plavsic, president of the Bosnian Serb republic (RS) which, under the 1995 Dayton peace treaty, covers half of Bosnia but is not a separate state. "The RS condemned any form of violence and its Interior Minister was instructed to conduct an investigation of Sunday's incident," Bildt's spokesman Colum Murphy told a news conference on Wednesday. He said Serb officials and U.N. police monitors agreed that existing plans and procedures would be properly implemented in the future. "Joint patrols of the area will ensure this is implemented," he added. Law enforcement and human rights problems in postwar Bosnia are monitored by the International Police Task Force (IPTF). Under the Dayton peace accord refugees from all three sides are allowed to return to their homes but the process, fraught with lingering ethnic mistrust, has barely begun. "The IPTF expects to start joint patrols with RS police in Gajevi area immediately," said IPTF spokesman Alexander Ivanko. An IPTF patrol visited the village in northeastern Bosnia on its own on Monday and reported some of the Moslem construction workers had returned and resumed work, he said. "They didn't see any Serb civilians or police in the area," Ivanko said. Kris Janowski of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Moslems, driven out of Gajevi during war in 1992, would probably wait to see if Serb authorities would keep their promises on patrolling the area and ensuring safety. "But I am quite sure they are determined to go back there," he told reporters.

ECAT	Brazil's net foreign reserves stood at $58.287 billion in August, or $59.643 billion according to the international liquidity concept, the Central Bank said. In the first eight months of the year, the current account deficit was $11 billion, or 2.8 percent of gross domestic product, versus $13.1 billion, or 3.5 percent of GDP, in the same year-ago period. The bank said 1996 net foreign direct investment totalled $5.423 billion through August, compared with $3.928 billion in the whole of 1995.   "It is important to stress that almost 50 percent of the current account deficit registered in the January-to-August period of 1996 was financed by direct investment, a participation well above the 16 percent seen in the first eight months of 1995," the bank said. The deficit in services was close to $12 billion, with net interest payments rising by $1.1 billion to $6 billion for the year so far.

CCAT	TVA Nuclear's 1,170 megawatt (MW) Watts Bar unit was operating at 75 percent power Monday morning after returning to the grid over the weekend, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said in its report. The unit was holding at 75 percent for repairs to the "main feedwater pump speed control system," the NRC report stated. The unit, in Spring City, Tenn., tripped off line March 6 due to a broken shaft on the main feed pump. Also owned and operated by TVA, the 1,065 MW Browns Ferry 3 nuclear unit, in Decatur, Ala., was running at 88 percent of capacity early Monday after restarting last week.

GCAT	Cyclone Gretelle uprooted trees and cut power lines on Tuesday in the Mozambican capital Maputo as it passed close to the country's Indian Ocean shores. Powerful winds reaching 56 km/hour hit the southernmost Maputo and Gaza provinces, the National Meteorological Institute reported. In the capital gale-force winds brought down trees in the streets and caused power cuts, but there were no reports of injuries or large-scale crop losses. The institute cautioned however that wind speed could rise to 76 km/hour later in the day. "Precautionary measures should be taken," the institute said in its warning. Cyclone Gretelle has reportedly left more than 30,000 people homeless and more than 100 dead or missing in Madagascar, west of Mozambique, and has been labelled the worst there in living memory. South African weather forecasters warned on Monday that the cyclone would cause heavy rains and high seas along the southern African coast.
CCAT	New Zealand's dairy export business was "no level playing field", Dairy Board chairman Sir Dryden Spring said on Tuesday. "The reality is that we have to face fierce competition from some the the best food companies in the world, in markets where the playing field is tipped against us by access restrictions and tariffs and the referee suborned by export subsidies," Spring said at the Dairy Board's annual meeting. He said while the Uruguay Round global trade accord had raised the board's butter quota by half, the size of the quota had been "nailed down" and the amount of duty payable had risen.
MCAT	Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly higher on Wednesday partly due to demand for funds before several new share issues and listings, traders said. The recent sharp decrease in funds on the repo market also contributed to Wednesday's rises, traders said. The annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract rose to 10.78 percent from 9.90 percent on Tuesday. Total turnover on the six-contract market fell slightly to 2.48 million lots from 2.53 million lots. One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.   Traders said major institutions borrowed heavily on the market to prepare for trading new shares, helping to push up the rates. One domestic A share firm is to start an offer and another is to list its shares on the Shanghai stock exchange in the next two days. A foreign currency B share firm is to list in Shanghai on Friday and an A share firm is to list in Shenzhen. Traders said liquidity had fallen in recent weeks after Beijing in June ordered state banks to pull out of state debt trading on the exchanges and in regional state debt trading centres.   "Major non-bank financial institutions, in particular securities houses, have been short of cash since state banks withdrew from the market," said one trader. "This has helped the repo rates to hold firm at high levels in the past few weeks," he said. But the weak performance of the stock markets on Wednesday prevented the rates from rising sharply, traders said. Traders said they believed the rates would move around the current high level in the short-term. Contracts on the T-bill spot market ended mixed, taking a break after weeks of rises saw yields fall sharply, they said.   The most actively traded 10-year bond that matures in June 2006, a market barometer, was at 112.40 yuan from 112.92 yuan. Combined volume on the eight-contract market rose sharply to 666,663 lots from 373,789 lots. Traders said they expected spot contracts to move narrowly around the current level in the next few days. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004

ECAT	Israel and Mexico have agreed to begin negotiations on a free-trade agreement, an Israeli official said on Tuesday. The idea was raised during a meeting on Monday between Israeli Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and visiting Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria. "The two sides agreed that there is joint interest in signing a free trade agreement," said the industry and trade ministry spokesman in a statement. "The (Mexican) foreign minister proposed launching contacts on the issue of a free trade zone immediately," he said. Sharansky said such an agreement would enhance trade relations between the two countries and would round out Israel's commercial ties with North America. Israel already has FTA agreements with the United States and Canada. Mexico trades freely with the two countries under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Israeli exports to Mexico reached $52 million last year mainly in chemical products, electrical and mechanical machinery, medical and optic supplies and plastics and rubber goods. The Jewish state imported $8.7 million in goods from Mexico in 1996 including textiles, agricultural products and foodstuffs. - Tel Aviv newsroom 972-3-5372211

GCAT	A high-ranking team of U.S. law enforcement experts has arrived in Sarajevo to aid the Bosnian government's fight against organised crime and to help ensure security for next month's national elections. "We are concerned about organised crime in Bosnia, as are Bosnian officials, and especially about narcotics trafficking," the team leader, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard, told reporters on Friday. "Eastern Europe is being swamped by a tidal wave of drugs which originate with the opium and heroin trade from Afghanistan. The old Balkan route is opening up again with connections to Turkey, Italy, many countries." Gelbard met with officials from the country's Moslem-Croat federation and from its Serb republic during the week, emphasising the need for law enforcement cooperation both within Bosnia and between Bosnia and its European neighbours. Describing drugs and organised crime as "trans-national" problems, Gelbard said post-war Bosnia needs help in restoring its entire criminal justice system, from local police all the way through the ranks of the judiciary. "Bosnian officials admit that their pre-war organised crime-fighting capability has been lost," the envoy said. "They have to develop an institutional capability to combat crime and narcotics, they have to realise that these are threats against the security of their government." Warlords carved up much of Bosnia during 43-months of war, dealing stolen automobiles, guns, drugs, food, fuel and human beings across front lines for enormous profit. Even in peace some of those same individuals and their organisations remain active. The counterfeiting of money and identity documents is a growing problem in Bosnia as well. Gelbard said the United States is prepared to provide training and technical assistance to Bosnia. More funds could come from a law enforcement donor's conference for Bosnia scheduled to be held in Dublin on September 28. As for security for September 14 elections, the envoy said he was satisfied that NATO-led combat troops, U.N. and local police were developing "reasonable" plans to deal with potential violence on election day. Authorities are concerned about potentially significant movements of voters across de facto ethnic boundary lines as they attempt to cast ballots in towns from which they fled or were expelled during the 43-month Bosnian war. NATO troops and U.N. police flooded the tense Bosnian city of Mostar during recent municipal elections there and prevented violence. Gelbard said the same approach might be used to calm likely flashpoints in the national elections. The Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe, which is supervising elections, has also considered erecting polling stations on either side of tense ethnic boundary lines so people could vote in the place where they are registered without crossing.
MCAT	Latvian shares gained slightly on Wednesday but the market remained sluggish, dealers said. Overall turnover was 68,000 lats, down slightly from 72,000 lats on Tuesday. Market capitalisation was 166.9 million lats. "The market is still stagnating...investors have been put off by poor financial results and privatisation looks like a better option than buying equities right now," Hansabank-Latvija dealer Andreta Petersone said. Despite the low volumes, the Rietumu index crept up by 0.53 percent to 175.13. Unibanka was the most active share in trade of 24,200 lats and its price fell slightly to 3.46 lats from 3.47 lats. The biggest gainer on the official list was Riga Transport Fleet, which rose to 1.23 lats from 1.20 on trade of 3,300 lats. Staburadze confectionery plant also rose, climbing to 2.70 lats from 2.69 lats in trade of 13,300 lats and dealers said it had room to go higher. "Based on Staburadze's first quarter results, one can forecast that its turnover and price direction will be more dynamic," Rietumu Bank's securities operations director, Dimtri Krutik, said. The company earlier told Reuters that its first quarter profit was 258,414 lats. Mangali Shipyard was the most active secondary market share in trade of 3,800 lats and its price rose to 1.17 lats from 1.16 lats despite posting a first quarter profit of only 41,000 lats. -- Ed Stoddard, Riga newsroom +371 721 52 40
GCAT	In a show of support, Argentine President Carlos Menem on Tuesday flew his cabinet for their weekly meeting to a town in the Patagonian Andes that has been struck by the lethal Hanta virus. "Solidarity is not shown by words but by deeds, that's why we've come here to work and find solutions for these people," the Peronist leader said in a speech upon his arrival in El Bolson, an idyllic town in the foothills of the Andes. Ten people have died around Bolson and the nearby ski resort of Bariloche in the latest outbreak of Hanta virus, a lethal disease spread by mouse and rat droppings which causes kidney failure and has a high death rate. With farmers and tourism operators complaining that the local economy was being ruined by spreading fear of the virus, Menem said he had come "to show the truth about a load of stories that have nothing to do with scientific opinion." Two U.S. infection experts, Brian Hjelle and Steve Simpson of the University of New Mexico, arrived in Bariloche last week to help local officials combat the spread of the virus. Hjelle called Hanta "a really strange virus" and said the strain found in Argentina was very different from the strain isolated in the United States. There have been cases of Hanta virus reported in Argentine towns as far apart as Oran, in the extreme north, and Rosario, just northwest of Buenos Aires. Argentine scientist Daniel Stamboulian said a vaccine would be easy to develop, but laboratories were unlikely to spend resources on such a rare disease. "The problem with the vaccine is that technically it is possible, but since it would be a vaccine for small towns, no laboratory or company is going to study it," he said. Viral specialists say Hanta cannot be spread by rats in cities. The virus was first isolated during the Korean War near the Hantaan river, from which it gets its name.

ECAT	Having drawn rave reviews for telling us precisely when they reach decisions to shift short-term interest rates, Federal Reserve officials are now being urged to give us better clues on how they get there. Two goals stand out among economists' pleas for a more user-friendly Fed: a) choose a specific, measurable policy objective; and b) tone down the background noise needlessly obscuring the Fed's real agenda. "The Fed should say: This is what we are committed to do and do nothing else.   "Then the public would have no uncertainty as to what to expect from the Fed," said Anna Schwartz, research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. To date, the Fed has failed to clearly spell out exactly what its agenda is, analysts said.  Minutes of the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee meetings note the FOMC seeks "monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output." The deliberate vagueness of explanations like that has frustrated many Fed critics, who charge the central bank with obfuscation in an attempt to maintain its considerable power.   "The Fed does not have a specific objective and what it does is not even observable.  That's the best situation for a bureaucrat to be in -- the Fed has enormous power without any accountability," said Michael Belongia, a one-time St. Louis Fed economist now a professor at University of Mississippi. The Fed technically answers to Congress, where the Senate must approve appointments by the U.S. president to the board of governors. But legislators, as well as economists and journalists, have struggled for years to interpret the cryptic remarks of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, often with little success.   In a typical remark before a Congressional panel last July, Greenspan summed up the economy this way: "I think we are approaching some form of a fulcrum, where the economy can go in two significantly different ways." Or witness the contradictory headlines on July 8, 1995 after another Greenspan Congressional appearance. The New York Times reported "Greenspan Sees Chance Of Recession," even as the Wall Street Journal trumpeted "Fed Chairman Doesn't See Recession on the Horizon." Yet many analysts have praised Fed officials for attempting to explain their policy goals to outsiders.   New York Fed President William McDonough has recently advocated an official inflation target based on the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), a widely watched inflation barometer.  But that indicator has problems, including an apparent tendency to overstate actual inflation by one or two percentage points. Therefore, McDonough has suggested a target of somewhere between 0.5 percent and 2.0 percent would equate to the Fed's more nebulous goal of price stability. The Fed has cleared up ambiguity on rate decisions, added better information to FOMC minutes and begun releasing meeting transcripts on a five-year delay, analysts noted.   To give any more information to the public might subject Fed policy makers to undue political pressures, from which their current secret deliberations largely insulate them, Fed supporters say. "The Fed does deserve some credit.  Most people would like a little more information, but you can understand why Chairman Greenspan likes to hold his cards close to the table.  It gives him more flexibility. There is a tradeoff," said William Dudley, U.S. economic director at Goldman, Sachs & Co Inc. Still, some critics say five years is too long to wait for the verbatim texts of the FOMC meetings.   Former Fed Board Governor John LaWare told Reuters earlier this year he would support more timely release of the transcripts. "In my opinion, there would be no disadvantage to releasing (transcipts) six months after the (rate) decision. I have never been a believer that all this secrecy was necessary," said LaWare. The limelight-shy Fed on February 4, 1994 took a huge step toward the public eye with an unprecedented announcement that it had raised its target for the overnight federal funds rate.   In typical "Fed-speak," the central bank said it wanted to "increase slightly pressure on reserves," which Fed-watchers -- the Wall Street gurus who dissect every word of Fed jargon -- interpreted as a 25-basis-point fed funds rate increase. Since then, the Fed has announced all 10 of its interest rate actions, with nine of the 10 coming at scheduled FOMC meetings, allowing interested parties to prepare. By foreshadowing its moves on short-term rates, the Fed has helped lower long-term borrowing costs by reducing the danger of an unexpected policy shift, economists said.   But greater policy transparency could translate into even greater rewards, analysts said. Fed officials informally acknowledge they no longer target money supply data, which have been clouded by technological innovations that have altered the way Americans spend money. Now many critics want the Fed to update some other anachronisms, such as the discount rate -- the interest rate the Fed charges to banks for emergency overnight loans. Though considered largely symbolic, the discount rate still roils the markets.   For example, a September 17 Reuters story indicating eight of 12 regional Fed banks had requested a discount rate hike helped send the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond down nearly a full point, raising its yield to 7.03 percent from 6.95 percent. Despite those eight requests, the Fed has not yet raised the discount rate.  Still, analysts said the central bank should regularly disclose which banks want a higher rate to better prepare investors and consumers.  "If you're walking down a dark alley, wouldn't you like to see a sign that told you there was a mugger waiting for you?" said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co International Inc. But most analysts prefer not to push the Fed too far.  For example, recent proposals to videotape FOMC meetings drew little support.  "There is such a thing as too much transparency.  If you open up the meetings too much, it will push the true discussions underground," said Goldman's Dudley. "People don't want to make serious statements if they know their words are going to be out in the next two weeks," added Belongia. -- 212-859-1664
CCAT	Four of Finnish pharmaceuticals group Orion-Yhtyma Oy's five divisions expect operating profits to improve this year, and the fifth division expects a flat profit, Orion said in its 1996 annual report on Wednesday. "The forecasts for Orion Pharma net sales and operating profit point to moderate growth," it said, referring to its biggest business group, which in 1996 accounted for 49 percent of consolidated net sales and 65 percent of operating profit. Oriola, which generated 32 percent of 1996 sales and 22 percent of the profit, was expected to perform on par with last year in 1997, Orion said. "The net sales growth of Oriola is expected to level off, and the operating profit is expected to remain at the previous year's level," it said. Referring to Noiro, which stood for 11 percent of 1996 sales and six percent of profit, Orion said: "Positive export expectations favour a relative strong growth in net sales. Operating profit growth is also expected." "Orion Diagnostica's net sales and operating profit are expected to grow," Orion said. Orion Diagnostica's slice of 1996 group sales was four percent and three percent of the consolidated operating profit. "Stronger demand is anticipated in Normet's business sectors, and Normet's net sales and operating profit (are) expected to grow," Orion said. Last year, Normet made up four percent of sales as well as of operating profit. Orion's consolidated net sales were 4.28 billion markka in 1996 compared to 4.06 billion the previous year, and its operating profit rose to 632 million markka from 596 million. The annual report repeated the company's earlier 1997 forecast that "Orion Group's net sales and operating profit may level off." -- Helsinki newsroom +358-9-680 50 245, news@reuters.fi
MCAT	The Chinese yuan closed up at 8.2955 on Friday due to a technical rebound after it fell to a one-month low of 8.2962 on Thursday against the U.S. dollar in Shanghai, dealers said. They said comments by president of the central bank on foreign exchange reserves had no impact on the yuan's movement. Dai Xianglong, the governor of the People's Bank of China, said on Friday at an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-Hong Kong Monetary Authority conference in Hong Kong that China's foreign exchange reserves amounted to $110 billion at the end of February.   "The number showed the central bank is continuing to buy dollars on the foreign exchange market," one dealer said. "Such activity is likely to increase in the near future, which will further depress the yuan." The weighted average price on Thursday was 8.2957. The yuan opened higher at 8.2956 and consolidated around 8.2960 for most of the session, hitting an intraday low of 8.2965 and a high of 8.2940. Trading was slow, dealers said. "Today's gains are a technical rebound after Thursday's falls," said a second dealer.   Dealers said they expected the yuan to move around 8.2960 early next week. The yuan closed down at 6.8540 from 6.8245 against 100 Japanese yen and up at 1.0708 from 1.0722 against the Hong Kong dollar.
GCAT	Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed concern Friday over mounting tension between the two communities on the divided island of Cyprus and called for maximum restraint. In a statement issued through a spokesman he also reminded all sides that the U.N. Charter forbade the threat or use of force and underscored the importance of "carefully prepared face-to-face talks" between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.   The statement was prompted by a recent deal by the Greek Cypriot-led government in Nicosia to acquire Russian-made S-300 ground-to-air missiles, and a warning by Turkey that it would launch an attack if the missiles were deployed. "The secretary-general believes that the events of the past week once again underline the inherent instability of the status quo and add urgency to the concerted efforts to achieve an overall political settlement through negotiations," the statement, read by U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard, said. The secretary-general "underscores the importance of carefully prepared face-to-face talks between the leaders," it continued, referring to Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, as head of the Greek Cypriot community, and Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader. "He calls upon the parties to avoid risk of confrontation on the island and urges all parties to exercise maximum restraint. The secretary-general reminds all sides that the United Nations Charter forbids the threat or use of force in situations such as this," the statement concluded.

ECAT	Another round of interest rate cuts is on the horizon in Europe, analysts said on Wednesday. Slumbering economies, subdued inflationary pressures, fiscal trends and currency flows all point to lower borrowing costs in countries from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia. Italy is the latest to take the plunge, slashing 3/4 of a point off a key rate on Tuesday, and more easings are expected. "It's very simple. There's no inflation threat in Europe," said Brian Venables, senior bond economist at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett in Amsterdam. "And everybody needs growth." Even Germany's Bundesbank, the kingpin of central banks in Europe, might opt for another interest rate cut in the coming months, although any credit easing will be minor, analysts said. "For the Scandinavians, you're talking about small cuts. For Italy we're looking for sizeable cuts. And in core Europe the cuts would be marginal," Venables said. The Bank of Italy cut the discount rate to 6.75 percent from 7.50 percent late on Tuesday. That compares with Germany's three percent discount rate, last cut in August 1996. Last week Spain reduced its key repo rate to 6.00 percent from 6.25 and Sweden lowered its repo rate to 4.10 percent from 4.35. Both countries pruned short-term rates steadily throughout 1996, while Italy has opted for fewer, but chunkier, rate cuts. Steven Major, head of bond research at Credit Lyonnais in London, noted the differing styles of rate reduction methods and said this pattern was likely to continue. "Italy is very much in a three-to-four-month cycle," he said, meaning it prefers to space out its credit easings, allowing the markets to price them in ahead of time. "It is in the Bank of Italy's interest to draw out the rate cuts," Major said. By doing so, the authorities were pushing down inflation and encouraging flows into the lira, which had an added anti-inflationary impact, he said. "Spain has gravitated towards the Swedish style rather than the Italian style. Spain has cut twice in the past month and is very likely to cut again next month," he said. Major said Swedish short-term rates even had scope to go below German rates, with the crown still firm and authorities under pressure to cut borrowing costs to get the economy into good fiscal shape for any move to a single European currency. It was the same story elsewhere. "The general pressure in the peripheral markets -- particularly Italy and Spain -- is the need to qualify for Maastricht," said Ifty Islam, European bond strategist at Merrill Lynch in London. As such, any inflationary risks these countries were running by slashing interest rates were outweighed by the need to get growth moving, if only to ensure that deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratios were low, analysts said. "It's more important to get your deficit down than to converge on inflation," Islam said. Credit Lyonnais's Major considered Sweden, Finland, Spain, Italy and Portugal as likely rate cut candidates in the coming months. ABN AMRO's Venables added Norway to that list. Meanwhile Britain, which is undecided on whether to participate in a single currency, is one of the few European countries enjoying decent economic growth. Bank of England governor Eddie George has called for a modest monetary tightening, but speculation has died down recently about the urgency for a rate increase. With signs of diminished consumer demand and lower than expected producer price pressures, many think rates may be on hold for a while.
GCAT	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked Palestinian President Yasser Arafat for a meeting as soon as possible because of clashes that have killed at least 50 people, an Israeli official said. A senior official who flew with Netanyahu to Israel from a European trip which cut short by the violence told reporters traveling on the plane from Germany that Netanyahu had made the request in a phone call to Arafat.
ECAT	Spanish Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato said on Thursday that the government was not worried by lower-than-expected fiscal revenue in 1996. He added that during January 1997, revenue rose six percent from the previous year. The Spanish government's revenues were totalled 1,210.0 billion pesetas ($8.5 billion) in December 1996 versus 1,277.8 in December 1995. Rato said government revenues were around 500 billion below the projected figures, partly due to lower-than-expected privatisation receipts.   In January 1996, revenues were 1,149.9 billion pesetas. Rato added that in 1997, Spanish debt will fall after having rose to 69.3 percent over gross domestic product in 1996 from around 65.3 percent in 1995. Rato was speaking to jornalists at a news conference on CPI data. -- Madrid Newsroom, + 341 585 8340
GCAT	President Bill Clinton's former partner James McDougal was sentenced to three years in prison on Monday after making a deal McDougal hinted might spell legal trouble for the president and first lady. McDougal, 56, could have received a sentence of more than 80 years in prison for his May 1996 conviction on 18 counts of fraud and conspiracy, but got off lightly because of his cooperation with Whitewater independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr. McDougal hinted to reporters afterwards he was giving investigators information that could implicate the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater scandal and urged everyone to "stay tuned" to developments. "I wouldn't go to the bank on that," McDougal said when asked if he believed the Clintons would be exonerated in the scandal, as he maintained during the May trial. U.S. District Judge George Howard recommended that McDougal serve his time in a prison hospital because of a variety of health problems. He also gave him a three-year probated sentence, with the first year to be served under house arrest, and a $10,000 fine. McDougal was set to go to jail on June 16, but he said he would likely appeal the case. Starr argued for a light sentence for McDougal, whom he said was providing investigators "information on a wide range of matters," including items that were previously known only to a "very small group of people." McDougal told Howard he took "full and complete responsibility for my crimes and misdeeds" and said he had "no excuse whatsoever to offer your honour." McDougal has been the central figure of the Whitewater investigation since the start and was closer to Clinton than anyone else brought to trial in the wide-ranging investigation. He came under federal investigation when his Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was declared insolvent and shut in 1989 at a cost of about $65 million to taxpayers. At his trial he was found guilty of using up to $3 million in illegal federally backed loans to help finance several real estate projects. Before his convictions, McDougal regularly ridiculed Starr and his team of attorneys as "Republican henchmen" and said he would never cooperate with them. But he quickly changed his tune after a federal jury found him guilty on all but one of 19 fraud and conspiracy charges. Since then he reportedly corroborated allegations by Arkansas banker David Hale that Clinton, then Arkansas governor, pressured Hale into extending an illegal $300,000 loan to McDougal's former wife Susan. Prosecutors alleged that $50,000 from the loan was funnelled into the flagging Whitewater real estate project in which the McDougals and the Clintons were business partners in the 1980s. Clinton and McDougal flatly denied Hale's allegations and legal experts said Starr's team would have to find corroborating evidence because McDougal's credibility as a prosecution witness would be weak. But McDougal said on Monday he was able to back his allegations. "The documentary evidence will substantiate anything I have said," he said. Starr's team also questioned McDougal on another real estate venture known as Castle Grande. Hillary Rodham Clinton acknowledged performing some legal work for the project, which federal regulators called a "sham transaction," as a private attorney. But she denied wrongdoing. Susan McDougal was convicted with her former husband and was sentenced to two years in prison for her role in the fraudulent loan schemes. But she refused to cooperate with Starr and was serving a contempt of court sentence because she refused a judge's order to answer questions before a Whitewater grand jury. She has said James McDougal told her he was lying to win a reduced sentence and that he urged her to do the same.
ECAT	Inflation expectations among Polish banks eased again in February, a monthly Reuter poll of the 24 biggest banks showed on Monday. Banks predicted average year-on-year inflation for the end of 1997 to be 16.17 percent, down from 16.23 percent predicted last month but well above the government's prediction of 13 percent. Forecasts ranged between 14.60 and 18.80 percent. Banks predicted monthly inflation this month against January would be 1.65 percent on average with a range of forecasts from 0.9 percent to 2.8 percent. Banks predicted year-on-year inflation in February 1998 at an average 15.77 percent, with the range from 13.0 to 18.70 percent. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700

MCAT	The Mauritian rupee weakened against the dollar and pound on Monday in line with international market trends, foreign exchange dealers said. The rupee was posted at a mean commercial rate of 20.084 against the dollar from 20.061 last Friday. Against the pound, the rupee traded at a mean of 32.727 from 32.675 last Friday. Dealers said the weaker rupee on Monday reflected a stronger dollar in overnight international markets. "Several banks are still long in their forex positions. Importers are slowly coming back after the dead season at the end of the year but demand (from importers) is expected to recover to normal levels only after January," a dealer said. The present long forex positions in banks are a result of good foreign exchange supplies from the island's textiles and tourism sectors offsetting low importer demand, dealers said.
MCAT	Midwest direct cash hog prices Thursday were seen steady to $0.50 per cwt higher, supported by reduced hog marketings as producers continue to concentrate on harvesting, livestock dealers said. Clear weather in much of the Corn Belt was allowing ample opportunities for producers to get serious about harvesting. Top prices for Iowa and southern Minnesota hogs delivered at the plant could range from $58.50 to $59.00. Illinois buyers said top prices could range from $57.50 to $58.00 at the plant. Indiana and Ohio buyers said top prices at the plant could range from $58.00 to $58.50.   Interior Iowa/southern Minnesota actual marketings Tuesday totaled 101,000 head, below that day's estimate of 105,000, according to USDA. Wednesday's estimate was 100,000 head. The lighter marketings were reflected in USDA's lower hog slaughter estimate Wednesday of 348,000 head, compared with 367,000 a week ago. The week-to-date estimate was 1.074 million head, about 1.0 percent below a week ago, but 2.9 percent above a year ago. Support from the lighter supply was partly offset by weakening pork prices, with midday carlot pork prices showing declines in bellies and lean trimmings. --Bob Janis 312-408-8720--
MCAT	U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Monday were seen steady to $0.50 per cwt lower, pressured by weak pork demand, livestock dealers said. Top prices for Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hogs at the plant could range $49.00 to $49.50 and Illinois top hog prices at the plant could range 48.50 to $49.00, they said. Indiana/Ohio top prices for hogs at the plant could range $48.50 to $49.00, the dealers said. Hog slaughter for the week was estimated at 1.695 million head, compared with 1.705 million a week ago and 1.808 million a year ago, USDA said.   Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota top hog prices at the plant Friday were quoted at $50.00, down $3.00 from the same period a week ago, USDA statistics showed. Hog cutout prices for the week also were in a slump. The gross cutout value of No.2 hog carcass weighing 175 lbs Thursday was pegged at $66.90, down $3.26 from last Friday. Lighter-than-expected marketings Thursday were tied to ideas producers were resisting lower prices by holding some hogs back, dealers said. Interior Iowa/southern Minnesota hog receipts Thursday totalled 97,000 head, below the estimate of 100,000, USDA said. Friday's estimate was 95,000 head. ((Bob Janis 312-983-7347))

CCAT	The Colombian government sold its 46.58 percent stake in the sprawling Cerro Matoso nickel mine to a subsidiary of South Africa's Gencor Ltd for 178.4 billion pesos ($165.8 million) Tuesday, a senior Finance Ministry official said. Gencor already owned a controlling 52.3 percent stake in the mine, through its subsidiary Billiton. The mine is the fourth largest producer of nickel in the world with an annual output of about 65 million pounds annually.   Billiton's was the only bid for the plant in an open auction conducted simultaneously through the country's three stock exchanges in Bogota, Medellin and Cali, said Clemente del Valle head of public credit at the Finance Ministry. The company bought the entire packet of 5.38 million shares at the base price of 33,148 pesos, Del Valle said. The government sold 2.32 percent of its stake in the mine to Cerro Matoso employees on December 16 for 4.17 billion pesos. The auction by Colombia's Sociedad Fiduciaria Industrial S.A., a branch of the government's Industrial Development Institute, was managed by SBC Warburg Inc and Corfigan, a subsidiary of Colombia's Banco Ganadero.

MCAT	Implied volatilities for dollar-pair options soared as the spot greenback extended recent gains in very choppy trading, dealers said. They said the dollar's bull trend had yet to run its course and volatilities were likely to stay firm for a while. The dollar rose past last week's peaks to touch a fresh 47-month high above 121.50 yen and a 31-month high of 1.6570 marks earlier in the day before pulling back slightly. Shorter-dated options, which have higher gamma values, attracted the strongest bids due to the dollar's rapid advances.   "At this point, it just seems to make sense to be long a lot of gamma," said a trader at a U.S. bank in California. "Your time decay can be covered by intra-day delta-hedging without a whole lot of trouble in this kind of market." Delta-hedging is selling or buying of spot dollars to maintain a position delta-neutral, or immune to the underlying market's directionality. A long-gamma trader, by trying to stay delta-neutral, would be selling spot dollars at highs and buying at lows -- a profitable operation provided the spot market makes enough fluctuation to beat the steeper time decay associated with high-gamma options.   One-week volatilities for dollar/yen and dollar/mark stood at 12.2/13.2 and 11.0/12.0 percent respectively, both up by more than a full point from Monday. One-month dollar/yen stood at 10.9/11.2 percent, up nearly a full point, while one-month dollar/mark was at 10.6/10.8 percent, up 0.3 point. Both dollar/yen and dollar/mark volatility curves were fairly steeply inverted, and traders predicted they would stay inverted until the spot market calmed down. "No one is brave enough to try and short the front end right now," said a trader at a European bank in Chicago.
MCAT	CBOT rice futures ended slightly lower on Thursday in quiet, choppy trade with late weakness linked to small sell stops, traders said. "LIT and locals were sellers," a trader said. "They hit some light sell stops at $9.60 (per cwt) in the September." The trade continued to watch crop developments in Vietnam where flooding has damaged up to 500,000 tonnes of rice. But Indian traders said Indian rice exports were unlikely to get a boost from the anticipated rise in Vietnamese rice prices. There was little domestic news to move the market, the traders said. Rice ended one cent per cwt lower with September down one at $9.64. Volume was estimated by CBOT at 300 lots, compared with Wednesday's actual volume of 312 lots. ((Emily Kaiser 312-408-8749))
MCAT	The Venezuelan bolivar closed marginally off in quiet trade as the Central Bank hung back from selling dollars into the market, traders said. The unit closed Thursday at 487.50/488.50 per dollar, which remains the Central Bank's reference rate until Monday due to the U.S.'s Independence day holiday. "The Central Bank didn't sell much ... and with the fall in interest rates this week the exchange rate's come under a bit more pressure," said one trader. Yields on benchmark six month TEMs, used to set wider interest rates, fell nearly one point to 20.78 percent in the Central Bank's regular Wednesday auction. Venezuela's foreign exchange market is unusual in that the Central Bank is its largest single supplier of dollars, which blurs the difference between the Central Bank supplying liquidity and intervening.

ECAT	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a meeting of state governors on Sunday that he saw no sign of big price pressures in the economy, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad said. Branstad, who was taking notes at the closed-door meeting, told reporters afterwards that Greenspan said he "saw no evidence of significant price pressure." Summing up Greenspan's comments to the governors on the economy, Branstad said, "He gave a positive report. We've had growth with low inflation."   Greenspan told the governors that technology is changing the economy very dramatically, Branstad said, boosting growth but making workers feel more insecure about their jobs. The Fed chief noted that unions have been emphasizing job security in recent negotiations with their employers. Asked about the accuracy of the consumer price index, Greenspan told the governors that progress has been made in improving the accuracy of the measure, Branstad said.
GCAT	Thousands of volunteers pitched in Monday to help residents haul away debris and rinse off layers of mud left by a week of devastating flooding along the Ohio River. "It's been fantastic. We've had church groups and children's homes help us out," said Sharon Thompson, a Red Cross centre manager in Radcliffe, Ky., 30 miles southwest of Louisville. In Metropolis, Ill., 150 miles downstream, townspeople have laboured for days towing trailer homes to higher ground and stacking sandbags ahead of Friday's anticipated crest of the Ohio River. "The people in Metropolis have really pitched in and helped their neighbours," said Bill Kommer, mayor of the city of 8,000 across from Paducah, Ky. "We've got a lot of volunteers. We've got inmates from a (prison) boot camp helping fill sandbags." "So far, our biggest problem is sightseers," he said. "They'll go around a barricade, and where the water is up on a house, the cars cause waves that lap up in basements and ruin furnaces." Kommer said the river was expected to rise another foot until Friday's crest and threatened to engulf the sewage treatment plant and whole city blocks. The Players riverboat casino was already closed and 35 families were staying with friends because their relocated trailers lacked electricity. Meanwhile, the river crested upstream at Owensboro, Ky., backing up water from the overflowing Green River that has turned three-quarters of McLean County into a murky lake. "It could stay that way for a couple of more days until the Ohio River recedes," said Dan Bundy of the Kentucky Disaster and Emergency Services division. Residents of hard-hit Falmouth, Ky., New Richmond, Ohio, Aurora, Ind., and scores of other communities caught up in the area's worst flooding since 1964 were glad for the outpouring of charity. "Though it has brought a flood of destruction, it has also brought a flood of compassion," said Rev. Wayne Mock in New Richmond. Around Indianapolis, volunteers collected donated clothing and food to distribute to tens of thousands of flood victims spread along the river and its tributaries in Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia. Others piled up ruined dry wall, carpeting, appliances and other possessions outside flooded homes to be trucked away. Chefs from a contingent of National Guard troops cooked for the two dozen residents of West Point unable to make it back into their water-logged town. A total of 118 homes in West Point were completely destroyed and 95 suffered major damage, authorities said. As most of the flood evacuees returned to their homes, Red Cross centres dismantled cots and set up desks to process applications for disaster assistance. A drowning victim was found Sunday among debris along the Licking River near Falmouth, raising to five the number of deaths attributed to the rampaging river that destroyed 80 percent of the town of 2,300. On Monday, officials combed the swollen Ohio River Monday near Stanley, Ky., for two people missing since a canoe accident Sunday. A third person was rescued. Overall, at least 59 deaths were blamed on tornadoes and flash floods that hit eight states the first weekend in March. Max Goldberg, the 83-year-old mayor of Falmouth, was making a rapid recovery from an apparent heart attack he suffered Saturday. Friends said Goldberg envisioned a rebirth of the town as a model 19th Century frontier settlement -- to be built on higher ground. This month's heavy rainfall provided slightly better news from the Tennessee Valley Authority, which operates a series of reservoirs and hydropower dams on the western end of the Ohio River Valley. Spokesman Gil Francis said there was enough watery fuel to churn out millions of kilowatts of cheap power.
CCAT	Westpac Banking Corp on Thursday unveiled an audacious A$1.435 billion bid for the much-smaller Bank of Melbourne Ltd, confident it would win the support of regulators and the national government. The friendly bid had been mooted by market speculators the previous day when shares in Bank of Melbourne, a regional bank with a strong mortgage loan book, jumped sharply.   Sydney-based Westpac, one of the four largest in Australia, has been interested in Bank of Melbourne, based in the state of Victoria, for about 18 months but had been told then by anti-monopoly regulators that a bid would not succeed. "Our regional banking approach will ensure Bank of Melbourne becomes a stronger competitive force in Victoria and retains its local identity," Westpac managing director Bob Joss told reporters, making his case for approval.   Australian Treasurer Peter Costello was non-committal about the bid, saying Westpac's move was a risky one as it came ahead of the release of recommendations from the Wallis inquiry into Australia's financial system. The inquiry's report was expected to support further takeovers by the big four banks of smaller rivals and other finance groups. With A$121.5 billion of assets, Westpac towered over Bank of Melbourne which had only A$9.2 billion of assets but has its sights set on the target bank's nine percent share of the Victorian market, about the same as Westpac now has.   Analysts said Westpac's move would also help shore up its defences against a possible bid by the biggest local bank, National Australia Bank Ltd, which is also based in Melbourne. "Obviously it would make Westpac somewhat less of a takeover target. To the extent that Westpac is less of a takover target (fellow major bank) ANZ becomes somewhat more of a takeover target," said ABN AMRO analyst Michael Pulman. Bank of Melbourne chairman Chris Stewart said the bank's shareholders should support the takeover bid which values each share at A$9.75.   "I'm absolutely in favour of this merger...it's extremely good for the shareholders who will receive a very fair price," Stewart said. Investors applauded the bid, sending shares in Bank of Melbourne seven percent higher to A$9.50 and nudging Westpac up one cent to A$6.88. Bank of Melbourne shares soared 65 cents on Wednesday before trading was halted. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the nation's anti-monopolies watchdog, said it would scrutinise the bid.   It has previously said it would not approve a merger that left a state market without at least one strong regional bank. ACCC chairman Allan Fels told Reuters that he warned Westpac two years ago the regulator would be hesitant to sanction a takeover of Bank of Melbourne. But he said he had a "neutral attitude" about Westpac's latest move. Analysts said the ACCC would face pressure to approve the bid from others in the finance industry who were also itching to go on the acquisition trail once the Wallis inquiry's report had been released and most likely adopted by the government.   -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
ECAT	A giant leap in corporation tax receipts during October has given the British government the leeway it needs to cut government borrowing in next week's budget, economists polled by Reuters said. According to a survey of 27 London-based economists, Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke is likely to slice one billion sterling off his forecast for this year's public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) to 26 billion and lop two billion off the previous target of 23 billion for 1997/98 when he announces his budget on Tuesday. Figures for October, which were released on Monday, showed a net repayment of 4.4 billion sterling back into government coffers, taking PSBR for the fiscal year so far to 11.4 billion sterling. "Those numbers will give the government an excuse to knock this year's forecast down by a billion," said Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan. The record tax receipts have provided Clarke with extra ammunition to cut taxes next Tuesday, with the Reuters survey predicting a net tax giveaway of around 2.25 billion sterling. "Before Monday's numbers there had been a risk that PSBR might reach 30 billion this year. The debt repayment in October takes that prospect away," said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Union Discount. "If Clarke cuts his PSBR forecast for next year, he can say he has managed to cut personal taxation and reduce PSBR for the coming year as well," he added. Economists agree the budget deficit is on a downward path, with the strengthening British economy swelling corporation tax revenue and reducing social security benefit payments. And while most agree the chancellor will meet the current forecast for this year of 27 billion, they are sceptical of his chances of undershooting the target. "The PSBR is on a downward path...it's just that its progress isn't as fast as it should be for this stage of the economic cycle," said Trevor Williams, economic adviser at Lloyds TSB. "The fiscal stance is undeniably being tightened but it is not being tightened enough, given the fact that there will be so many boosts to consumer spending next year," he added. -- Karen Iley, London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7958
ECAT	President Clinton on Friday hailed the news that the U.S. jobless rate had dropped as evidence that his economic strategy was working. "Today, we received one more piece of solid evidence that this invest-and-grow strategy is working," he said in a written statement after the Labor Department said the jobless rate fell in May to its lowest level in more than 23 years. "America's economy is the strongest it has been in a generation," he said.   Clinton said the balanced-budget blueprint he had reached with Congress embodied his strategy for economic growth. He welcomed what he called Congress' "strong endorsement" of the plan on Thursday. The House of Representatives and the Senate put the final stamp of approval on an agreement to balance the U.S. budget by 2002. It serves as a blueprint for spending and tax legislation which will be crafted this summer and will need Clinton's approval to become law. "This bipartisan action is a hopeful sign that both parties can work together to keep our economy growing," Clinton said. "I look forward to working with leaders of both parties to write our balanced budget plan into law." Clinton repeated his vow to veto a disaster relief bill because of what he called "unacceptable political items" attached to the legislation by Republican leaders. "I have no choice but to veto that measure," he said. "Unfortunately, the Republican leaders of Congress have chosen the path of partisanship and confrontation in their actions on the disaster relief bill," he said. He urged Congress to pass "straightforward disaster relief legislation" for him to sign.
CCAT	Pride Petroleum Services Inc said Wednesday it has concluded the purchase of 13 mat-supported jackup rigs from Noble Drilling Corp for $269 million in cash. The company said the purchase was financed through the sale of senior notes and common stock. The company said it issued $325 million of 9-3/8 percent senior notes due May 1, 2007.

Lawmakers included dozens of smaller maintenance projects as part of an approximately $35.6 billion all-funds budget approved at the close of their session at the end of May, spokeswoman Ellen Feldhausen said. They approved spending $98.358 million from the Capital Development Fund, $60 million from the Transportation Series B Fund and $18.7 million from the Anti-Pollution Fund on numerous projects, according to a budget bureau summary. Scheduled projects include improvements to prisons, health facilities, a courthouse roof, drinking water facilities and wastewater treatment plants. The bond authorization and actual spending on projects differs as a result of varying schedules, Feldhausen said. Lawmakers approved an $18.175 billion general fund budget for fiscal 1998 beginning July 1. ((--David Bailey, Chicago Newsroom, 312-408-8647))
ECAT	UK retail sales data may be marginally understating the strength of consumer activity because the index has not been re-weighted since 1992, an Office of National Statistics statistician said on Tuesday. "My view is that it would be understating the strength slightly but we don't know how significant the impact is. I'd be surprised if it was more than marginal," said Harry Duff, ONS retail sales statistician. "In terms of the three-month on three-month and year-on-year comparisons, the current series is still a good indicator of trend," he told Reuters. Areas of key concern include fast growing shopping venues such as out of town hypermarkets, he said. The series has not been updated for so long because statisticians were awaiting the new ONS business register which contains a definitive list of British firms. This means that all the different series of data can now be drawn from standardized lists, making comparisons between figures easier. The re-classification of British industry groups also caused a delay, Duff said. He expects the weightings to be rejigged by the summer of 1998 for 1995 or 1996 figures and says this may even happen this year. The latest British retail sales figures show an annual rise of 4.6 percent in February, the highest rate since March 1989. Some economists played down the significance of any tardiness in re-weighting the official data. "I don't think the weightings matter," BZW economist Robert Barrie said. "Retail sales and consumer spending are simply not living up to some of the more extravagant forecasts." -- Cheryl Juckes, London newsroom +44 171 542 5109.

ECAT	The consumer price inflation rate in Hong Kong fell to 4.9 percent in August, its lowest level in nine years, the government said on Monday. Consumer Price Index (A), the territory's most widely used inflation measure, fell sharply from the 6.1 percent increase recorded in July. "This is the lowest inflation rate recorded since July, 1987," the government said. Inflation fell across the board and was reflected in a decline in all three of the main indices, CPI(A), CPI(B) and the Hang Seng CPI. The composite CPI also fell, to 5.4 percent in August from 6.2 percent in July. "Looking forward, this is a plus. Hong Kong is getting its costs under control," said Andrea Cheng, economist with Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong. Comparisons with the inflation rate at this time last year are unavailable following a rebasing of consumer price indices earlier this year. Food and housing costs showed the sharpest decline, although price increases in durable goods, meals bought away from home and miscellaneous goods also fell. Economists said the figures confirm that an economic recovery is in the wind, but warned its pace will be slow. "A slow rate of inflation is a reminder that it will be a slow recovery," Cheng said. "You have to remember that inflation is a lagging indicator and this is more a reflection of a weak economy in the second half of 1995 and the first half of 1996." Eddie Wong at HG Asia said housing costs will continue to depress the inflation rate for the next six to 12 months because of a peculiar Hong Kong feature called rental reversion. Housing costs, typically a major component of most Hong Kong people's pay packets, lag economic conditions by up to two years because that is the usual term of most rental agreements. "The economy is picking up quite rapidly but housing costs are lagging because of rental reversion," Wong said. This feature is partly responsible for a subdued or declining rate of inflation during economic recovery in Hong Kong, Wong said. "We expect inflation to remain under control even through next year," he said. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6441

GCAT	Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived in Amman on Monday and went straight into talks with King Hussein on the latest crisis in peace talks with Israel, officials said. The crisis was touched off by a twin suicide bombing in Jerusalem's main Jewish market on Wednesday. The bombings killed 15 people including the two Arab attackers and plunged Arafat's already frosty relations with Israel's right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to an all-time low. Officials said Arafat would seek King Hussein's support in the face of Israeli pressure on him to crack down on Islamic militants after the bombings. After the bombings, Israel suspended peace talks with the PLO and sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip, disrupting Palestinian trade and preventing tens of thousands of Arab workers from reaching their jobs in the Jewish state. It also threatened to re-enter Palestinian self-rule areas to fight militants if Arafat did not do the job. Ahead of the Arafat-Hussein meeting, Jordan urged Israel to keep peace talks with the Palestinians alive, saying the alternative would be a "catastrophe" for the whole region. "This is a matter, we pray to God, will not happen because the alternative is a catastrophe for the whole region...We do not accept this talk (of ending the peace talks)," he said. "There is a great and pressing need for joint efforts to keep the peace process alive," he added. Netanyahu was quoted on Sunday as saying that Israel would not honour peace deals it signed with Arafat unless the Palestinian president cracked down on Islamic radicals. Tarawnah said the bombings should only toughen the resolve of the parties to the conflict to get the peace process back on track. Jordan, he said, was also working with Washington to formulate ideas for an initiative to serve as a basis for resumption of stalled peace talks, ahead of a visit by U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross to the region to try to defuse growing tension. Jordan privately supports the view that Israel has been footdragging on implementing its 1993 peace deals with the Palestinians and that the bombings were being exploited to backtrack on its peace commitments. Tarawnah attacked Israel for taking punitive security measures against the Palestinians, saying such steps were counterproductive and hindered the ability of Palestinians to stem terrorism. "Peace is in essence security, but there are other dimensions aside from security which should be taken into account, which relate directly to Palestinian rights and their aspirations from peace," Tarawnah added, saying Israel should treat the Palestinian Authority as a partner not an enemy. King Hussein has said the bloodshed could have been precipitated by growing frustrations with a stalled peace process and anger over an accelerated Jewish settlement drive in the West Bank. He has expressed increasing exasperation with Netanyahu's policies, publicly doubting his resolve to advance the peace process. Jordan is worried by the repercussions of renewed violence in Palestinian territories on its own stability. The kingdom's 4.2 million people have close ethnic ties with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
ECAT	World Trade Organisation analysts argued on Wednesday that both rich and poor countries would benefit from a binding agreement setting rules for the treatment of foreign direct investment (FDI). Their controversial report, compiled by the WTO's usually cautious secretariat, said only negotiation among the trade body's 123 members could provide the "global and balanced framework" for such a deal. The outcome of such talks -- rejected by several key emerging economies -- "will have an important impact on the efficiency with which scarce supplies of capital and technology will be employed in the next decade and beyond," it declared. "If there were multilateral rules in the area of foreign direct investment and countries could bind their FDI regime in the WTO the way they can bind their tariffs and certain other things, then this would reduce the amount of uncertainty surrounding investment across international frontiers," Richard Blackhurst, director of WTO's economic research division and joint author of the report, told a news conference. "Companies always have the option to invest at home. Private investors always have the option of putting their money in an investment that is domestic rather than international. "So if you can reduce the amount of uncertainty facing investors making investment across borders where the payoff period for the investment can be as long as 20 or 25 years -- they have to predict policies that far out -- then to me it is inconceivable that there wouldn't be more FDI than there would otherwise be," said Blackhurst, an American economist. The team of analysts said that investment and trade were mutually supportive in a joint process "central to development strategies and, more generally, to worldwide efforts to increase wealth and raise living standards." WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero has already said the report makes a compelling case for tackling in the trade body the fast-growing volume of FDI flowing into national economies. The European Union, Japan and Canada want agreement on some sort of WTO talks on investment rules to be included in a declaration to be issued by the flegling trade body's first ministerial conference in Singapore in December. Their proposal has been fiercely resisted by some developing countries -- primarily India, Malaysia and Tanzania but also Indonesia -- which argue that WTO rules would make it impossible for them to pursue national industrial policies. "Member countries face a certain policy decision. In the short-run, the policy-decision is what to do at Singapore -- whether to create a working party to begin not to negotiate but just to examine the issues, to explore in more depth what we have begun to explore in the study," Blackhurst told reporters. "We make it very clear in the study that we are not prejudging that. It is a decision that the member countries have to take," he added. Any accord in the WTO, which replaced the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in January 1995, would be based on the principle of national treatment -- or setting the same rules for both foreign and domestic investors. Last week a senior Indian official told an investment forum at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) that his country, although opening up its once state-dominated economy, could not accept such restrictions. Major powers argue that the size of FDI in the global economy -- soaring to an estimated $315 billion last year from $60 billion in 1985 -- makes a global agreement vital.
CCAT	Greek construction firm Gener will issue a three-year, Athibor-based coupon paying convertible bond worth 1.4 billion drachma following the approval of its general shareholders meeting on Monday. Gener did not specify the Athibor tenor. Athibor is Greece's reference interbank rate. Gener will issue 1.0 million bonds and existing shareholders will be entitled to one convertible bond for 7.59 outstanding registered shares, it said in a statement. The stated conversion price is 1,500 drachmas, it said. Its turnover was flat at 8.035 billion drachmas in 1996 from 8.028 billion in 1995 and its 1996 pretax profits were slightly up to 1.555 billion drahcmas from 1.542 billion a year ago. Gener will pay a dividend of 70 drachmas per share for fiscal 1996, up 40 percent on 1995 after adjusting for the IPO, it added. Its orderbook of uncompleted projects stood at 15.3 billion drachmas on June 15, it said. --Dimitris Kontogiannis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4

MCAT	Toronto stocks finished mixed on Wednesday after weak bonds offset gains in most sectors, including a rumor-driven rally in transportation. The TSE 300 Composite Index rose 11.88 points to close at 5163.77. But declining stocks outnumbered advancers 447 to 421, with 302 issues ending flat. Trading was active, with 72.17 million shares changing hands for a total value of C$926.85 million (US$676 million).

Canadian bonds finished weaker along with a sluggish U.S. market as investors await key U.S. jobs data on Friday. Trading was heavier on the TSE than Tuesday's post-holiday session, but Kellett said some investors are still sidelined. "Too many people recall that September and October are not great months and they're not prepared to get too aggressive at this stage," he said. Among the TSE's 14 sub-groups, transportation added over 100 points. Other strong sectors included energy, banking, base metals and conglomerates. --- HOT STOCKS --- * Waste and transport giant Laidlaw Inc. class B topped the most-active list, climbing 0.35 to 13.50 on 3.8 million shares.

CCAT	Swedish ferry operator Stena Line AB posted on Wednesday mounting losses for the first half of the year, blaming currency losses and delays in new ferry deliveries for its poor six-month performance. The company posted a loss of 560 million crowns for the first half of the year, down from a negative 350 million crowns in the same 1995 period. The loss for the first seven months to July had been 340 million crowns, Stena said in a statment.   "In addition, volume growth and price levels have not been strong enough to compensate for increasing capacity and market costs," Stena added. Passenger volumes grew eight percent in the first half of 1996 while the number of cars transported rose 10 percent. Freight volume fell by one percent. Passenger volumes on Stena's British lines rose by 9.0 percent and car traffic rose 12 percent. Virtually all the increase was attributed to higher demand on the Dover-Calais route as cross-Channel traffic rose sharply. Stena said its market share of car traffic volume -- including Eurotunnel -- rose by five percentage points to 18 percent in the six-month period. Stena said high-season traffic across the Channel had been dominated by heavy price discounting and this would effect third-quarter results. -- Simon Haydon, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700-1004
ECAT	Brazil's public sector accounts are showing an improvement with the consolidated public sector operational deficit falling to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first two months of 1997, a newspaper said. Gazeta Mercantil said this figure compared with a deficit of 3.85-percent of GDP in December last year. Planning Minister Antonio Kandir said the fall in the operational public sector deficit, which includes interest payments on debt, was largely the result of lower interest rates, according to Gazeta Mercantil. However, the primary public sector deficit, which excludes debt interest payments, also improved, with the first two months of 1997 showing a surplus of 0.32 percent of GDP in comparison with a deficit of 0.07 percent of GDP in December, Gazeta said. Kandir said even though the public sector accounts were showing an improvement it was too early to see this performance as an "unmistakable trend", Gazeta said.

CCAT	Yorkshire-based chemicals group Allied Colloids Plc said on Tuesday that its strategy of growing organically remained unchanged, despite the $390 million acquisition of CPS Chemical Co Inc of the U.S. Chief executive David Farrar said Allied Colloids "has not been acquisitive" by tradition. "We saw this as an opportunity that does not come along very often," Farrar said in a telephone interview with Reuters following the announcement of the purchase and interim results.   "This is a good strategic fit for us. CPS are in the same business as us, the chemistry is similar. We have had a long association with them and have been major customers of theirs for eight years." The move will substantially increase Allied Colloids' sales in the U.S, which already accounts for more than 30 percent of its annual turnover. CPS, which has plants in Arkansas and New Jersey, had sales of $157 million last year, some 75 percent of which were in the domestic market.   Farrar said Allied, which provides chemicals for a wide range of industries including paper-making, minerals, textiles, oil and pharmaceuticals, remained committed to expansion in other key marekts, notably Europe and the Far East. But this would be achieved "by organic growth." Allied Colloids believes the acquisition of CPS, which is partly being financed by a two-for-seven rights issue to raise 173 million stg, will be earnings enhancing in its first full financial yuear. It said it also expected to benefit from substantial U.S. tax credits.   Farrar said the combined group would have a workforce of around 3,500 following the addition of CPS' 360 employees. He said CPS, which makes chemical intermediates and finished polymers for industry, will complement Allied in a number of areas, notably in coatings, paper and pollution control. It will also add to Allied's technological base and provide new products to market through its existing 400-strong salesforce. The rights issue and acquisition were accompanied by an upbeat statement on prospects, with Allied Colloids predicting a continued improvement in second-half sales and profits.   First-half pretax profits rose 3.8 percent to 21.1 million stg on sales up 9 percent at 207.6 million stg. Farrar said sharp falls in raw material costs earlier this year started to feed into second-quarter results, but their full impact would be felt in the second half. He predicted that gross profit margins would increase by 1 percentage point in the second half from the 37.5 percent seen in the first half and the 36.2 achieved in the 12 months to March. Allied is also predicting a further pick-up in sales growth in the second half of the year, implying full-year sales of more than 430 million stg compared with 393 million a year earlier. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
GCAT	A German court said on Thursday it had released on bail a suspected Red Army Faction guerrilla charged with helping Palestinian militants hijack an airliner, and with the 1977 kidnap and murder of a German industrialist. The Frankfurt regional court said Monika Haas, 47, had been released on Wednesday night after ruling that the threat of her fleeing her trial was remote. The current trial is the second for Haas. The first was suspended in February 1996 so that she could be treated for a slipped disc. German prosecutors said they had filed an appeal against the Frankfurt court's decision to release her. Prosecutors allege that Haas smuggled weapons, explosives and a detonator into the Spanish island of Majorca in 1977 for the hijackers of a Frankfurt-bound plane. Palestinian guerrillas commandeered the Lufthansa airliner, which was full of German tourists, in a bid to secure the release of Red Army members held in Germany. The pilot was shot dead when the plane landed in Aden, but the remaining 86 hostages were freed when West German commandos stormed the aircraft in the Somali capital Mogadishu. Haas also stands accused of taking part in the kidnapping and murder of industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer. He was found dead a day after the Mogadishu raid. Haas, who lived with her children and worked at Frankfurt university until her arrest in 1994, denied both charges. The Red Army Faction, which succeeded the Baader-Meinhof Gang, waged a campaign of killings, bombings and kidnappings against the West German establishment and U.S. military in the 1970s and 1980s.
ECAT	Brazilian inflation between Jan 21 and Jan 31 slowed to 0.22 percent, against 0.69 percent between Dec 21 and Dec 31 as measured by the IGP-M index released by the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV).   The IGP-M is composed by three other economic indicators. They are the IPA wholesale price index, which fell 0.18 percent in the period, the IPC consumer price index, which rose 0.88 percent in the period, and the INCC national index of construction costs, which gained 0.21 percent. The IPA has a 60 percent weighting in the IGP-M, the IPC a 30 percent weighting and the INCC 10 percent, the FGV said.

GCAT	England manager Jack Rowell found himself without a team to coach on Wednesday when the 43-strong international squad carried out their threat to boycott the first training session of the new season. Only a handful of officials were present at Bisham Abbey near London when Rowell drove into the training ground with no players in sight. Instead the squad will attend a meeting called by the English Professional Rugby Union Clubs (EPRUC) to discuss the current contract war. The players' Rugby Football Union contracts expired at the weekend and the EPRUC, who plan to split from the union and run their own competitions, have taken the initiative. The clubs, who are currently the players' sole employers, want more money and power in the new professional era and have declared they will set up as an independent organisation in October. England also face expulsion from the Five Nations' championship next Monday after a row over television revenue.
ECAT	The most telling aspect of the Fiscal Year 1998 budget, unveiled by the Massachusetts Senate Ways and Means Committee, is not actually part of the Fiscal Year 1998 budget. Rather, it resides in what chairman Sen. Stanley Rosenberg calls a "companion bill," a $293.1 million appropriation package released Thursday with the $18.3 billion spending plan, State House News Service reported. Almost half of the companion bills total is used to pay the final installment on the record $1.2 billion the state borrowed to bail itself of the fiscal crisis that swept fiscal conservative Gov. William F. Weld into office. Half the companion bill pays off the last of that debt. The rest will fund several one-time projects, including new textbooks and library supplies for primary and secondary schools, and new cars for state police. The companion piece is funded by this year's surplus. Without having to put money in the budget for deficit-bond debt service, Rosenberg said, the committee could authorize $82 million in tax cuts -  a development unthinkinkable seven years ago. "It closes that chapter," Rosenberg said, "but it doesn't change our mindset about not repeating the mistakes of the 80s.  We don't make commitments we can't keep." Most of the commitments in the budget, which will be debated in the Senate starting Tuesday, focus on children, senior citizens, and others who need assistance. ((--Boston bureau, 617-367-4106))
MCAT	The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday ordered the Chicago Board of Trade to submit a plan to resolve the shortage of grain storage capacity. In an unprecedented move, the CFTC ordered the CBOT to raise the capacity and number of locations for grain delivery required to meet corn and soybean futures contracts.   The CFTC in an open meeting warned that if the CBOT does not comply with its order within 75 days, the agency will formulate its own solution to the problem. The CFTC's action is intended to prevent any chance for market manipulation. "We are giving the exchange one more opportunity to align its delivery terms with the realities of the cash market," said CFTC Commissioner Joseph Dial.   "If the current environment of political gridlock at the CBOT precludes the exchange from coming to closure on this matter, then the CFTC will have no other alternative but to do it for them," Dial said. In October, CBOT members rejected a proposal to raise the number of locations available for grain delivery. That plan would have permitted corn, wheat and soybeans to be delivered against futures contracts in Chicago, Toledo, Milwaukee and at points along the Illinois River, and eliminate St. Louis as a delivery location.
MCAT	Taiwan investors were shaken but unbowed by China's 1996 sabre-rattling. Long after Beijing's menacing March missiles fell silent, it was Taiwan's stock market that rocketed more than 30 percent. Securities analysts say they expect the rally to continue in 1997 despite wide expectations that Beijing will exploit Hong Kong's July 1 return to Chinese rule to turn up the political heat on Taiwan. The weighted Taiwan index surged to an intraday high of 7,084.25 on December 3 -- 37 percent above its end-1995 level of 5,173.73 though still far below its lifetime high of 12,682.41 set on February 12, 1990. The TAIEX managed to breach psychological resistance at 7,000 a few times in December but failed to hold its gains. It closed at 6,932 points -- a 34 percent gain from its end 1995 close of 5,173.73 points and a dramatic recovery from a 1996 low of 4,672.67 recorded on February 7. "The index reboundedly strongly on an easing of tensions with China after the March presidential elections," said George Hou, a fund manager at Jardine Fleming Securities. Taiwan's financial markets sagged during the second half of 1995 as Beijing mounted a campaign of military intimidation that peaked with weeks of war games and missile tests in waters near Taiwan before its March 23 presidential election. The missile tests in March caused financial near-panic and prompted massive government intervention to stabilise both the Taiwan dollar and the hypersensitive stock market. China, which has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since civil war split them in 1949, waged the campaign in what it acknowledged was a bid to crush any hopes of Taiwan emerging as an independent country. Taipei's intervention is credited with halting a serious flight of capital and easing investors' frazzled nerves. Analysts say Beijing's long shadow remains inescapable, but note that Chinese influence is not necessarily bad. Quite the opposite, say some. "The China factor will continue to be the dominant factor for the market and this will contribute a lot on the market's expected rally in 1997," said Hou of Jardine Fleming. Most analysts say Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule in July will be a boon for Taiwan stocks, with more than 10 analysts interviewed by Reuters forecasting the index will test 8,000 or even 10,000 points in 1997. Support is seen at 6,500. Nikko Securities research chief Michael Hung said "a bullish greater China market due to China's commitment on Hong Kong's return and (anticipated) direct shipping links with Taiwan" would bring three bullish years for Taiwan stocks. Other positive factors surging liquidity due to tax cuts and capital injection by foreigners and local investors for a planned futures market and a 1997 recovery as Taiwan's economic fundamentals are seen to have bottomed out. "After Hong Kong's return to China, I believe Taiwan and China will enter intensive cooperation to benefit the bilateral economy," said trading manager Alex Chiu of Capital Securities. Since July 1995, the central bank has cut commercial banks' reserve requirements five times and has lowered rediscount rates three times to boost the enonomy and support the stock market. These are seen as the government's most effective measures. The central bank also has eased restrictions on foreign ownership of local stocks, raising the cap to 25 percent from 15 percent at the beginning of 1996. The liberalisation has stirred overseas interest in Taiwan equities. Morgan Stanley in April sparked a long rally by saying it would incorporate its Taiwan stock index in its global indices from September. The positive factors will carry into 1997, analysts say. "Loose liquidity helped drived the 1996 rally, and, to help an expected economic recovery in 1997, I believe the central bank will continue its loose monetary policy in 1997," said Albert Lin, research manager at Golden Securities. The government statistics bureau in November forecast 1997 gross domestic product growth would clock 6.20 percent, a good rebound from its expected 5.70 percent full-year 1996 showing. The soaring growth of the global information technology market will pay healthy dividends for Taiwan's growing numbers of listed high-tech exporters, analysts said. Taiwan's property market should mount a strong recovery in the latter half of 1997, becoming a locomotive to boost both the economy and the stock market, Chiu of Capital said. For 1997, analysts say semiconductor, construction, steel, financial and "China-play" shares will take turns leading the upward momentum. They note some worries for 1997, including the expected sale of some T$10 billion (US$364 million) from 17 closed-end funds in the first quarter. The funds issue cash dividends in March. Plans by exchanges in Chicago and Singapore to list futures and options linked to Taiwan stock performance will spur stock market turnover but also boost volatility, analysts said. "Taiwan stock index-futures will be totally new to local investors, and they will not know how to react to it," said Hou of Jardine Fleming.
GCAT	The United States and its European partners appeared still at odds on Thursday as NATO defence ministers met for the last time before a landmark summit to expand the alliance beyond the former Iron Curtain. Washington was expected to tell its allies that it would prefer to see enlargement restricted to only three new members, probably Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, at least for the foreseeable future. But some European countries want to add Romania and Slovenia to NATO's invitation list, which will be announced at a summit in Madrid on July 8-9. "Smaller would be better initially from my perspective," U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen said on Wednesday when asked about Romania and Slovenia. Twelve countries in former communist Eastern Europe have applied for NATO membership. Cohen said he wanted the enlargement restricted to three as he was concerned over the costs, the ability of some easterners to meet the miliary demands of membership, and reservations in the U.S. Senate over any enlargement at all. Meanwhile France, backed by the EU's Christian Democrat leaders including German Chancellor Helmut Kohl this week, is strongly pushing for Romania to be included in the first wave. Advocates argue that both Romania, with its Black Sea coast, and Slovenia, in the volatile Balkan region, offer strategic advantages to NATO. NATO sources said the two-day meeting was unlikely to reach agreement on the final details of a reformed command structure, considered vital to fit the alliance to the realities of the post-Cold War era and make it flexible enough to undertake more Bosnia-style peace missions. They say the election in France of a Socialist government has made it unlikely Paris will carry out earlier plans to reintegrate into the military wing it quit in 1966 in a row over U.S. dominance. French reintegration has been considered to be the price for concessions by other allies, including Britain, on scrapping some commands, which is also seen as necessary to cut costs and create a more flexible grouping as the alliance gets bigger. The allies are also set to debate ways of boosting cooperation with Russia now the former foes have agreed to create a standing NATO-Russia council. NATO signed a new partnership deal with Russia last month as a reluctant Moscow's price for letting the Western alliance take in some of its former communist satellites.
ECAT	The rise in Hong Kong rates on Wednesday to match the rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserves on Tuesday will have little effect upon the territory's growth rates or economy, economists said. Hong Kong rates would have to rise substantially, possibly in excess of 100 basis points, before the economy would start to suffer and there are few signs this will happen, they said. "I factored in this rate increase into my GDP (gross domestic product) forecast of 5.5 percent this year, so if the rate hike is less than 50 basis points, I won't be changing my forecasts," said Kevin Chan, economist at Salomon Brothers. With inflation forecast to rise one percent this year to seven percent from six percent, a 100-basis point increase would be required before Hong Kong's real interest rates started to climb, Chan said. "Even if they raise rates 50 basis points this year there will be a net decline in real interest rates here because of inflation," he said. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased the U.S. Fed funds rate by 25 basis points on Tuesday to 5.50 percent, prompting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - the territory's de facto central bank - to raise Liquidity Adjustment rates by 25 points to between 4.25 percent and 6.25 percent. The Hong Kong rate hike was widely expected because the LAF is used to maintain the territory's currency peg of about HK$7.80 to the U.S. dollar. The Hong Kong Association of Banks followed suit at a special meeting on Wednesday afternoon, increasing regulated short-term deposit rates by 25 basis points. The hike prompted the territory's five major banks immediately to increase their prime and best lending rates to 8.75 percent from 8.50 percent. Sun Bae Kim, senior economist at Goldman Sachs argued that the move in adminstrative rates was much more significant for Hong Kong than the LAF or HKBA rate increase. At 8.75 percent, the best lending rates are well above inflation forecasts of seven percent and could well have an effect -- albeit minimal -- upon private consumption, Kim said. "It might represent better the opportunity costs of money to the person making the decision whether to invest in property or not," he said. "Best lending rates are well into positive territory and that's a more relevant measure." Kim argued that the next rate increase would give a better indication of Hong Kong's resilience to rising rates. Tuesday's increase was expected by markets, but there is nervousness about the U.S. rate outlook. "Traditionally, the Fed under (chairman Alan) Greenspan would not call it quits after one hike, especially one of 25 basis points," he said. "From that end point, I would be watching carefully how the asset markets digest this going forward." Most Hong Kong economists seem to be expecting a maximum U.S. and Hong Kong rate increase this year of 75 basis points, and generally seem to agree that anything more than that could hurt the Hong Kong economy. "Looking at what the market expect right now, there is nothing to indicate an increase of, say, 100 basis points is expected," said Rob Gvozden, economist at Lehman Brothers. "Something like this would have to start being priced in to the property market, the stock market, and we've seen no sign of this," he said. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6470

CCAT	China is planning to invest 3.82 billion yuan ($460 million) to expand the Lanzhou Oil Refinery in China's western Gansu province, an official at the refinery said on Tuesday. The project, to be completed by 2003, would increase the firm's annual production capacity to 10 million tonnes from 5.5 million tonnes, the official told Reuters by telephone. The crude oil used by the plant is mainly from oil fields in China's northwestern region of Xinjiang, the official said. China has also begun building a railway linking Korla near existing oilfields in Xinjiang to Kashgar in the southern part of the region. The project calls for total investment of more than 6.0 billion yuan ($723 million), the Financial News said. "If the railway in southern Xinjiang could be opened, it would be good for the transport of our crude oil," the official said without giving further details. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)
MCAT	Tokyo stocks plunged nearly 700 points in frantic trade on Friday, their biggest fall in a year and a half, after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of "irrational exuberance" in U.S. markets. Fears of a possible Wall Street dive later on Friday provoked panic sales in Tokyo, sending indices into a tailspin. Japanese government bonds and the dollar were also hit. "Greenspan's comment sparked fears about New York stock movements tonight and forced people to close their positions ahead of the weekend," said Chisato Takahashi, a fund manager at Credit Suisse Investment Advisory Co. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index ended down more than three percent after Greenspan's comments on Thursday night, which came before the Tokyo opening, fuelled fears about recent euphoria on Wall Street. The Nikkei shed 667.20 points to end at 20,276.70, having fallen as low as 20,171.69. It was the largest decline since April 3, 1995. Its December futures were 730 points lower at 20,210. Greenspan had told a dinner meeting that the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up doing damage to the economy. "We as central bankers need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs and price stability," he said. Although Greenspan stopped short of commenting on the recent steep rise in Wall Street prices, dealers took the comment as a sign that the Fed was indeed concerned. "People saw the comment as showing that the Fed thinks the present situation (in U.S. financial markets) is a bubble," said Yasuhito Kawashima, chief manager of foreign exchange at Toyo Trust & Banking Co. Jesper Koll, chief economist at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo, said yen markets were "almost certainly overreacting". "I think any dip below 20,500 is a buy as large-cap companies will pull off formidable earnings surprises in the coming six to 12 months," he said in a commentary. The Fed holds its next policy-making meeting on December 17 and is widely expected to opt to hold interest rates steady amid signs of moderate economic growth with steady inflation. Greenspan's remarks triggered heavy sales of the dollar because of fears that U.S. stocks and bonds would take a battering later on Friday, dealers said. The dollar stood at around 111.89 yen and 1.5380 marks in late afternoon Tokyo, against New York closes of about 112.33 yen and 1.5495 marks. Japanese government bonds, both cash and futures, also suffered, undermined by slumping U.S. Treasury bonds as well as large-lot selling by powerful institutional investors. The key March JGB contract ended the session at 125.38 after dipping to a low of 125.10 from Thursday's 126.34. A hefty volume of 11.8385 trillion yen ($105 billion) was traded. The key U.S. 30-year Treasury bond was down more than 1-1/3 points from New York's Thursday close and traded at 98-17/32 in late Tokyo. Tokyo stocks had risen earlier in the day, aided by news that telecoms giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) would be split up into a long-distance company and two local-call firms under a single holding company. The decision follows a decade of debate over how Japan can best compete in the increasingly global telecoms business. The news boosted NTT shares, as well as some other blue-chip issues, such as Sony Corp. NTT shares ended up 15,000 yen ($133) at 845,000 yen ($7,544,). ($1=112 yen)
CCAT	Cummins Engine Co Inc filed Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to register a shelf offering of up to $250 million in debt securities, preferred stock, common shares and warrants.

No underwriters were named in the shelf offering.
CCAT	Guitar Center Inc's initial public offering, projected to raise about $100 million, is now set to price this week, said lead underwriter Goldman Sachs on Monday. The Agoura Hills, Calif.- based company is offering 6.75 million shares at a price range of $14 to $16 a share. John Fitzgibbon, editor of the IPO Aftermarket, said he was seeing wide ranges on premium expectations for the deal: "anywhere from a 1/4 to a 1/2 to one (point)," he said.   Guitar Center is a retailer of guitars, amplifiers, percussion instruments, keyboards and pro audio and recording equipment.  As of December 31, 1996, it had 28 stores in the United States. Linda Killian, analyst at IPO research firm Renaissance Capital Corp, had a positive outlook on the company. "We were impressed by the fact that their same store sales have been so strong," she said.  "And they seem to have a very replicable store format and the national roll-out should continue their nice sales growth".   Acording to its prospectus, Guitar Center's comparable store sales growth has averaged 14.8 percent per year over the fiscal 1992 through fiscal 1996 period, but the company cautions that it does not expect comparable store sales to continue to increase at historical rates. The company has also said it plans to grow aggressively in existing and new markets. It opened seven stores in fiscal 1996 and expects to open about eight stores in both 1997 and 1998.   Steven Tuen, analyst at IPO Value Monitor, was not upbeat on the company. "We're fairly neutral - probably a little bit on the negative side," he said. He said that Guitar Center's aggressive growth strategy could hurt comparable sales because it will "divert some of their resources away from their existing stores". And, said both Tuen and Killian, the company's strategy of clustering stores resulted in some cannibalization of existing stores.   Analysts agreed that one definite area of concern was the company's highly leveraged position. The company estimates in its filing that on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the offering, it would have had about $66.7 million of outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 1996, and its long term debt to capitalization ratio would have been about 110 percent. The company has said it plans to use some of the IPO procedds to repay debt, but analysts are leery of such high levels. "We think this is a little bit too much of a financial risk," said Tuen. Manish Shah of IPO Maven said that while the company's debut could be hot, "the stock is not going to survive (at a high price)". "The problem is with the capital structure, and as a result it becomes extremely overpriced". Guitar Center had net sales of $213.3 million in 1996, and a net loss of $72.4 million. This compares with net sales of 107.7 million and net income of $10.9 million in the prior year. The company attributes its 1996 loss to recapitalization expenses and non-recurring deferred compensation expense. -- Kamalakshi Mehta, New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610

GCAT	NATO ended an historic two-day summit on Wednesday with leaders vowing to close the Cold War divide between East and West as the alliance brings former Soviet bloc foes under its security umbrella. Setting NATO's course for the rest of the century and into the next, the 16 member-states invited in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, promised to admit others in the future and launched a new security council spanning three continents. U.S. President Bill Clinton hailed it as the dawning of a new Europe "undivided, free and at peace" and predicted the new defence arrangements would help sweep away the last remnants of what was once known as the Iron Curtain. But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov, head of Moscow's delegation to the summit, reasserted Russia's strong opposition to the alliance's eastward thrust, telling reporters: "The expansion of NATO presents more problems than answers." Within the alliance, the enlargement plan unleashed one of the most heated summit battles in decades. The United States ultimately prevailed with its demand that the first wave be limited to the three favourites, but France won a pledge to consider Romania and Slovenia in future rounds. The debate also exposed serious differences over the U.S. role as the world's sole remaining superpower and resentment about what is seen as growing American heavy-handedness. "The negotiations were difficult, sometimes sharp, but we were able to build a bridge," German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told reporters. "This is a huge success." The bickering that marked the summit's closed-door sessions came into public view at the leaders' final news conferences, with Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac at odds over the costs of the biggest expansion in NATO's 48-year history. Chirac said France would not pay an extra franc toward NATO's budget to finance the admission of new members. "We took a very simple position, that enlargement should be done at zero cost," he said, arguing that there was no longer a military threat in Europe and the alliance needed lighter structures and smaller forces. But at a separate news conference, Clinton said the United States and its allies would have to bear "modest costs" for building military infrastructure in the new member states. Cost estimates for NATO's eastward enlargement have varied wildly, with the Clinton administration putting the pricetag at $27-35 billion by 2009 while the U.S. Congress budget office put it as high as $100-200 billion. Kohl dismissed these estimates as exaggerated in the interests of the military-industrial complex. "It is completely absurd to link NATO enlargement with cost factors as if the aim was to rearm large areas of Europe to the teeth," he told a news conference. Chirac, who led a bloc urging wider enlargement, told reporters: "You can always say that it's not enough and not fast enough but you can't ignore that progress has been very rapid." But after the summit ended, Chirac told reporters he was certain NATO would invite Romania and Slovenia to join in 1999 when it marks its 50th anniversary. During the second day of the summit, NATO took another major step toward redrawing the European security map, inaugurating a new security council of nations spanning North America, Europe and former Soviet Asia. Leaders of the alliance and 28 partners formally launched the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, an organization intended to meet the security concerns of non-NATO members. NATO also signed a sweeping new security charter with Ukraine, sealing the Slav nation's shift away from the former Soviet sphere of influence and closer to the Western orbit. The new grouping includes countries seeking alliance membership like Romania and Slovenia, neutrals such as Switzerland and Austria, and former Soviet republics like Lithuania and Tajikistan. Russia is also a member, but in a clear sign of protest against NATO's enlargement, President Boris Yeltsin snubbed the alliance by sending only a low-level delegation. The council, which will have a secretariat at NATO's Brussels headquarters, gives a direct channel of communication to NATO in case of any external threat, a forum for political consultation and a basis for joint military exercises. Unspoken at the NATO summit is the fear that Russia may some day abandon the road to democratic reforms and again threaten its neighbours. At the summit on Wednesday, Serov repeated that Moscow was "categorically opposed" to the admission of the Baltic states into NATO and maintained that Russia was ready to provide "all the necessary security" for them. Russia insists that membership by any of the former Soviet republics would threaten its own security. Risking Moscow's wrath, the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have applied anyway. Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis predicted his country would join within seven years.

CCAT	Western Resources Inc may need a partner if it wants to retake the offensive in its hostile bid for ADT Ltd, analysts and investment bankers said. Western's stock and cash offer of $3.5 billion, or $22.50 a share, is competing against Tyco International Ltd's friendly stock agreement, worth $29 per share, or a total of $5.6 billion.   The Tyco deal, disclosed Monday, is structured as a reverse merger, which neutralizes Western's "dissenter rights," or its option to take cash for its ADT shares at a court-supervised appraisal. As a result, Western's best hope of prevailing is to top Tyco's offer, investment bankers and analysts said. "Outside of Western offering $30 per share, or a considerably raised cash component, which I don't think they can do, they would have to find a big partner," said Jeffrey Kessler, a Lehman Brothers analyst who follows ADT, which installs and services electronic security systems.   Under a complex arrangement, Tyco agreed to merge with a unit of ADT; the ADT parent company would then be renamed Tyco International Ltd, Tyco said. Dissenter rights allow shareholders who disagree with a proposed merger to go to court to obtain an appraised market value of their shares. They then would be offered cash for their stock based on that appraisal. If Western had such rights and took cash for its shares, it could destroy the pooling-of-interest accounting, a condition necessary for the Tyco deal to proceed.   "The Tyco agreement is much closer to our valuation of what ADT is worth, which is far more than $22.50 per share, because ADT is moving from being an electronic security company to one providing a gateway to the home to control all kinds of sensors," Kessler said. Western, a Kansas-based utility company, already owns 27 percent of ADT, or 38.3 million shares. It acquired the stake in multiple transactions for $589 million, which equals a cost basis of $15.40 per share, a Western spokesman said.   With its ADT stake, Western also stands to walk away with an estimated $500 million gain under the current offer by Tyco, a diversified maker of industrial and commercial products. While the sources did not know of any ongoing discussions between Western and other possible partners, they said companies that would make the most sense as co-bidders include Ameritech Corp and MCI Communications Corp.   Ameritech could join Western in sweetening its offer for ADT, though any cooperation would have to be structured around limitations imposed on Ameritech's buying additional alarm-monitoring companies, as mandated in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, according to analysts and attorneys. While Ameritech is barred from acquiring additional companies such as ADT, it is allowed to acquire select assets of electronic alarm businesses, according to a Washington attorney who helped write the act while on the staff of the House Commerce Committee.   Ameritech can "grow the business, acquire customer lists and so forth," he said. Western and Ameritech have declined to comment on a possible joint bid for ADT. A partnership with MCI would expand an existing relationship initiated when Western acquired Westinghouse Security. The latter provides home and business security monitoring bundled with other MCI telephone services. An MCI spokesman declined to comment on the speculation, but said the company "is not aggressively marketing the security products at this time." ((--Wall Street Desk, 212-859-1734))
GCAT	Some 800 people have been evacuated as a precautionary measure from homes in eastern Cuba as heavy rains lashed most of the island, official media said on Thursday. The bad weather, which began at the weekend and was expected to continue at least for the next 24 hours, followed extensive damage to crops last month when Hurricane Lili hit western and central areas of the country. The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said 800 people were evacuated from low-lying areas of eastern Holguin province, most of them from the town of Sagua de Tanamo. Six houses collapsed in Baracoa, in Guantanamo provice, after constant rain for the last few days, the agency said. While the worst of the weather hit eastern provinces, Havana was also lashed by rain and wind. There have been numerous power cuts in the capital in the past three days, apparently because of fallen electricity cables and transformers.

"Today's turnover is close to what we can call normal and it's mostly on the back of foreign activity," one broker said. The SBI index rose 8.28 points to 1,405.0. Since June 26, when the central bank announced its decision to relax rules for long-term foreign investors, the blue-chip index has risen 13.5 percent. Overall eight shares rose, seven fell and two were flat, while 10 were untraded. Turnover rose to 314.4 million tolars from 280.8 million. Drug maker Lek had the highest turnover, jumping 3.29 percent to 32,020 tolars on volume of 4,094 shares for total turnover of 129.7 million. Market participants said Lek's good business performance and future outlook could drive the share price up to 35,000 in the next few weeks. Brokerage Dadas was the top gainer, surging 10.19 percent to 5,840 tolars on volume of 57 shares. Bank Probanka led decliners, tumbling 7.84 percent to 20,690 tolars on volume of 160 shares. Traders attributed the fall to a technical correction. -- Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439
GCAT	Relatives of 13 Catholics shot dead by British troops in 1972 called for a fresh inquiry on Friday after reports that Britain covered up key facts of what became known as "Bloody Sunday". Britain's Channel 4 News said it had "exclusive proof that successive British governments covered up the full story of Bloody Sunday for a generation" and an Irish writer said new evidence pointed to previously undisclosed army gunfire. "I would like to see the case reopened, that is the first priority," said John Kelly, whose brother Michael was a victim of one of the British region's most controversial episodes when paratroopers opened fire at an Irish nationalist rally. An official inquiry headed by Lord Widgery, Lord Chief Justice, exonerated troops saying that they had come under fire. But Catholics opposed to British rule have always dismissed the findings. They say the casualties were unarmed victims of deliberating shootings on Sunday, January 30 1972. "Murder was committed that day in the name of the British government," Kelly, chairman of a families' Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign, told Reuters. He was speaking ahead of a report that Channel 4 News said was based on audio tapes of military radio messages "suppressed since the official inquiry", which refused to accept them as evidence because they had been illegally obtained. The programme will be aired on Friday night ahead of the 25th anniversary of Bloody Sunday and against a background of renewed violence by Catholic-backed Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas and threats that their Protestant "loyalist" foes will avenge it. "Recorded by a radio ham, the tapes prove that soldiers other than the Parachute Regiment were positioned along the old City Walls of Londonderry and indicate that these men fired and hit civilians," the television news organisation said. "Channel 4 News has obtained post mortem evidence which shows that at least three unarmed men were killed by bullets fired down through their bodies from above. "The City Walls are located high above the Bogside area where people were killed and are in direct line of sight to where the three men fell." A separate investigation by an Irish human rights activist, Don Mullan, who studied many of the original first-hand accounts, turned up a similar finding. He uncovered almost 50 statements from people who said soldiers were positioned on the walls and many were "very clear that firing was coming" from that vicinity, he told Reuters. Mullan, whose "Eyewitness Bloody Sunday" is published on Saturday, said: "Widgery confines himself to...the 108 rounds allegedly fired by paratroopers at ground level. He did not deal with the role of the British army on the walls." Three of victims had been hit from a 45 degree angle. Mullan said that from the statements and autopsy reports, an independent ballistic expert, Robert Breglio, who had spent 25 years with the New York City Police Department, had concluded that they were likely to have been "hit by a single marksman using a telescopic sight operating from a height". "I think that the case must be reopened because we have always known that these people wre murdered. We have raised enough suspicion... to warrant an investigation, especially into these three, and preferably into all 13 killed that day," Mullan said. -- Belfast Newsroom +01232-234099
MCAT	The Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) said on Tuesday that it would raise the margin requirements on its October rubber futures contract by 40,000 yen per trading lot, effective from Wednesday. This would bring the margin fee on the October contract to 102,500 yen, TOCOM said in a statement. The increase is intended to cool overheated trade. The margin fees on the remaining November to February contracts will remain unchanged at 52,500 yen, TOCOM said.
ECAT	France's central government budget deficit was 10 billion francs lower in April than at the same period last year, Budget Minister Alain Lamassoure said on Thursday. An official said this was based on provisional figures, and final data for April had not yet been calculated. Lamassoure, who is also government spokesman, reiterated that he was sticking to his forecasts for this year. France has pledged to reduce its total public deficit to three percent of gross domestic product to meet Maastricht treaty criteria. He said in a televised debate that talk that the deficit may widely overshoot government targets this year was based on a worst case scenario drawn up by the budget ministry. "Every year in Janury the budget department draws up 10 hypothesis on the outlook for the French economy and French finances from the most catastrophic to the best case scenario," he said. "A rather catastrophic hypothesis has been published somewhere. The others have not been published," he said. "What I can tell you are two things. One, the reality of the figures for the end of April, the latest month available, show the government budget 10 billion francs lower than last year," he said. "Therefore I stick to my target. France will qualify for the euro," he said. He also noted that the government's growth forecast for this year of 2.3 percent was judged by independent forecasts as too cautious. -- Paris Newsroom +33 1 4221 5381
GCAT	Three Slovenian rightwing parties, which won half the seats in parliament in a general election, said on Thursday they had agreed a cooperation pact to improve their bid to form the next government. The rightist "Slovenian Spring" alliance of the conservative People's Party, centre-right Social Democrats and Christian Democrats together won 45 out of 90 parliamentary seats in the November 10 election. They missed out on an absolute majority by just one seat in Slovenia's second general election since declaring independence from former Yugoslavia. "The agreement, that will result in tight cooperation between the three parties in parliament, could be signed before the first session of the new parliament on November 28," Christian Democrat spokesman Valentin Hajdinjak told Reuters. The parties are attempting to unseat Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, whose centre-left Liberal Democrats emerged as the single biggest party in the election, winning 25 seats. The alliance was seeking to form a goverment with People's Party leader Marjan Podobnik as premier and, if successful, would swing Slovenian politics firmly to the right. The People's Party, which won big support from farmers suspicious of Ljubljana's bid to join the European Union, is the strongest of the alliance parties with 19 seats. The alliance has already approached the Liberal Democrats, offering them a place in government if Drnovsek steps down as premier. But the Liberal Democrats have refused, saying they will only take part in the next administration if Drnovsek remains government leader. Hajdinjak said the "Spring" parties were confident of gaining enough support among other smaller parties to form a working government even if Liberal Democrats refused to join in. The cooperation pact has made Drnovsek's task of forming the next government much harder. He has to prise one or two of the "Spring" parties out of the alliance to have any chance. President Milan Kucan said on Tuesday he would choose a candidate for prime minister within 30 days of the first parliamentary session, during which time he would hold consultations with the leaders of all parties in parliament.

CCAT	Software company Borland International Inc. said Wednesday it expected to report an operating loss for the current quarter. The company said it expected a loss of 52 cents to 62 cents a share on revenues of $33 million to $36 million for its fiscal third quarter ending Dec. 31. In the same quarter a year ago, Borland reported a profit of $849,000, or 3 cents per share, on revenues of $47.3 million. Borland attributed the loss to not shipping any new products in the quarter and slowing sales of existing, mature products as customers anticipate upcoming and previously announced product releases.
CCAT	LaserSight Inc said it granted a license to Photon Data Inc, of Winter Park, Fla., for LaserSight's scanning technology patent. In June, LaserSight received a U.S. patent covering an ophthalmic surgery method that uses a non-contact scanning laser.  The company said it then notified manufacturers of refractive laser systems of the patent. Photon is the first company using scanning technology to receive a license from LaserSight, the company said. Under the agreement, Photon will pay LaserSight a 7.5 percent royalty fee based on gross sales of Photon's Scan-190 SmartScan laser.  LaserSight is in discussions with other manufacturers on licensing agreements, the company said. --Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787

GCAT	A Saudi Arabian suspect held in Canada over a bombing in the kingdom which killed 19 U.S. airmen last year was on Tuesday quoted as saying Canada had decided to deport him to the United States. The Saudi-owned Arabic daily al-Hayat reported that Hani Abdel-Rahim Hussein al-Sayegh said from his Ottawa prison that "Canada has decided to deport him to the United States". "He told al-Hayat the Canadian government will issue a statement within 48 hours which will give the reasons for deporting him to the U.S.," added the London-based paper, which had published previous interviews with Sayegh from his prison since his arrest on March 18. Sayegh, who had denied links to the June 25 bombing, told al-Hayat earlier this month that he wished to be tried in Saudi Arabia and that he was confident of his innocence. In Washington, U.S. officials said on Monday Sayegh's deportation to the United States was imminent and could happen by Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest. Some said Tuesday was the most likely date for Sayegh's deportation, although they acknowledged it could be delayed by last-minute problems. FBI agents have been standing by in Ottawa to take him to the United States. Sayegh has been identified in Canadian court documents as the driver of a car that gave the go-ahead signal for an explosives-laden fuel truck involved in the bombing. U.S. officials have long sought to question Sayegh about the attack on the compound that housed U.S. military personnel at Khobar in eastern Saudi Arabia. Canadian Citizenship and Immigration spokesman Rene Mercier said the government would only give out details after Sayegh had gone. "We will not be talking about where he is going or when he is going (ahead of time)," Mercier said.

GCAT	A goalkeeper was taken to a police station and charged with assault after punching a referee who sent him off during a match at the Maracana stadium. Valtenir, who plays for Rio Branco, left the Maracana in a police car surrouned by four officers after referee Kleber Goncalves made a formal complaint during Thursday night's match against Flamengo in a Copa Brasil match. Valtenir was shown the yellow card for time-wasting after half an hour of the game, reacted by throwing the ball at the referee, and was immediately sent off. On being shown the red card, Valtenir rushed at the match official and grabbed him by the neck. He then punched him twice and kicked him before police stopped the attack. He left the pitch shouting "the referee's been bought by Flamengo" into the microphones of radio and television reporters. Valtenir was released by police after being charged and refused to make any comment. His actions soured what should have been a night of glory for the part-timers who come from the small city of Rio Branco, in the heart of the Amazon rain forest near the border with Peru. Most of the players had never visited Rio de Janeiro before and had only dreamt of playing in the Maracana. Rio Branco won the first leg of the second-round tie 1-0 at home last week when Flamengo sent a reserve team to spare their star players the exhausting plane journey. On Thursday, they held on until the last minute of the first half when Romario scored for Flamengo. Romario scored again after the interval as Flamengo went on to win 5-1. The Copa Brasil involves the winners of the 27 state championships played throughout the country and is designed to give teams from remoter areas the chance to play against the big clubs. Flamengo joined Atletico Paranaense, Vitoria, Gremio, Corinthians, Internacional, Ceara and Palmeiras in the last eight.

CCAT	Italian financial holding Gemina firmed on the Milan bourse in heavy trade after the stock rose above 1,000 lire in the previous session. At 1418 GMT, Gemina was quoted 3.04 percent higher at 1,020 lire after a high at 1,030, in volume of over 30 million shares. Analysts said there was no real news to drive the price higher but were expecting the group to make capital gains on the hive-off of its industrial interests into a new conglomerate, HPI, expected to make its bourse debut soon. One analyst also cited strong growth in Gemina's Fila clothing company in the second half of 1996, boosted by the dollar's recent rise. New York-listed Fila posted third quarter 1996 net profit of 65 billion lire, up 77 percent, with sales up to 611 billion lire from 435 billion, rising especially in Europe. -- Milan newsroom +392 66129589
ECAT	Zambia said on Wednesday a rise in the price of maize would cause the southern African country to miss its annual inflation target. "Our target for the year was 18 percent but because of the maize distortion we hope to achieve a year-end inflation of 26 percent," Zambian Finance Minister Ronald Penza told Reuters. Penza, speaking at the Southern African Trade and Investment Summit in Harare, said the target was still a substantial drop on the 45 percent inflation seen last year. -- Paul Harris, Harare Newsroom + 263-4 72 52 27/8/9
GCAT	An awe-inspiring display of power and precision earned Pete Sampras his fourth Wimbledon title on Sunday when he crushed Frenchman Cedric Pioline 6-4 6-2 6-4 in one hour 34 minutes. The 25-year-old world number one, winner here from 1993 to 1995, lost only a handful of points against his own thumping serve and pressured Pioline's deliveries, with inch-perfect returns. Pioline, 28, and the first Frenchman to reach the Wimbledon singles final since Yvon Petra in 1946, was forced into a string of volley errors by the sheer power of the American's ground strokes. The 44th-ranked Frenchman, watched by his wife Mireille on her first visit to London, did produce some delicate touches -- an exquisite lob and several passes down the line -- but he was no match for Sampras. Sampras, a consummate grasscourt player who dropped his serve just twice in seven matches at the championships, broke Pioline's serve once in the first set, twice in the second and once in the third. There was never any question who was in charge. It was the American's 10th grand slam win. He needs two more to equal Australian Roy Emerson's grand slam record.

MCAT	Nebraska feedlot cattle near midday Wednesday sold at $103.00 to $103.50 per cwt on a dressed basis, steady with Tuesday, but down $0.50 to $1.00 from last week, market sources said. About 15,000 head sold, which brought the week to date figure to 32,000 to 35,000, the sources said. On a live basis, bids at $63.00 were passed by owners pricing cattle at $64.00, but expected to trade at $63.00 by the end of the day, private sources said.

GCAT	The Libyan government on Monday announced it has recognised the change that occurred in Zaire, now renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo, Libyan state-run radio reported. "The Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya announces its recognition of the Democratic Republic of Congo and is fully ready to cooperate with it," the radio, monitored in Tunis, quoted the Libyan foreign affairs ministry as saying in a statement. The statement was dated Sunday, a day after Laurent Kabila, leader of Zairean rebels, proclaimed himself head of state, ousting long-ruling president Mobutu Sese Seko, and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Libyan statement made no direct mention of the new leadership in Kinshasa but said the decision was based on the fact that ties with other countries were made "between peoples and not governments." Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi last December expressed support for Mobutu. "The presence of President Mobutu at the head of power in Zaire is the sole guarantee for Zaire's unity," the official Libyan news agency JANA quoted Gaddafi as saying at the time. "If Mobutu disappeared, Zaire's fate would be that of Somalia after Siad Barre and of Yugoslavia after Tito, and Zaire would therefore be a place for instability in the African continent," he added. Somalia and Yugoslavia both plunged into civil wars after Barre and Tito. Mobutu in 1995 visited Libya where he held what he called excellent talks with Gaddafi.

CCAT	Companion Building Material (Holdings) Ltd said it had reached a conditional agreement to buy New World Development Co Ltd's Super Trend Ltd unit in a HK$70.4 million share swap agreement. Super Trend and its units are engaged in the production and sale of ceramic tiles. Companion said it would transfer 55 million shares in its 58.48 percent-owned Companion Marble (Holdings) Ltd, valued at HK$1.28 per share, and rights to receive warrants in Marble to Chi Lam Investment Co Ltd, a subsidiary of New World. Chi Lam would also assign to Companion the benefits of an interest-free loan of HK$239.55 million due to a Chi Lam unit from Super Trend, it said. The HK$70.4 million price is subject to adjustment on the basis that if the net current asset value was less than HK$19.16 million, Chi Lam would pay Companion the shortfall and if it was greater, Companion would pay the excess. Companion said its interest in Marble would be reduced to about 46.23 percent and Marble would cease to become a unit of the company. New World would become a substantial shareholder of Marble and have the right to nominate a representative to the board of Marble. -- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843 6345
CCAT	Shares in major UK supermarket chains advanced on Thursday, while shares in Kwik Save Group Plc languished, amid perceptions that the big grocers were winning market share back from the discount high street shop, analysts and traders said. Safeway Plc shares -- which have lagged behind those of their main competitors -- -- led the advance, rising 11p, or 3.3 percent, by 1201 GMT to 344. Shares in J. Sainsbury Plc added 7-1/2p to 356-1/2, having matched its peak for the year at 359 earlier. The shares rallied on Wednesday, after the group posted strong-than-expected results. Shares in Tesco Plc firmed 2p to 376-1/2; it also met its year high at 379p earlier. Shares in Kwik Save, meanwhile, tumbled 17p, or 5.5 percent, to 291, after the group said its same store sales fell six percent during the first seven weeks of its second half. "Safeway, Tesco and Sainsbury appear to be gaining market share at (Kwik Save's) expense," an analyst said. "This is the first time we've seen that happen in two or three years."

MCAT	CME live cattle futures erased early gains and retreated for a net loss in April before ending with small gains as commercial hedging interest continued to weigh on futures and offset a sharp rebound from Wednesday's "mad cow" scare, traders said. Live cattle closed 0.425 cent higher to unchanged with June up 0.375 at 64.275 cents. Feeder cattle ended 0.325 to 0.850 higher with May up 0.625 at 70.850 cents. Live cattle slipped as further commercial hedging interest offset the early retracement of Wednesday's bovine spongiform encphalopathy (BSE) scare, traders said. Live cattle futures shot up at the start on what was considered an overreation Wednesday to the rumor of an Indiana rose grower dying from Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a human version of BSE. There was no evidence to point to any connection with the U.S. cattle herd, which is BSE free, and the insinuation that the dead man may have had gotten CJD from using bone meal fertilizer, traders said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said they do not believe there is any link from using bone meal fertilizer and BSE, sometimes called "mad cow disease" in Britian, and the man possibly dying from CJD.   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also said that deaths in the U.S. from CJD were rare and not known to be linked to "mad cow" disease. However, futures slipped as commercial hedging resumed following the initial bulge in futures prices. Traders noted that commercials had been sellers before the CJD story fully influenced the market as they resumed their hedging in anticipation of a seasonal break in prices. "From a trend standpoint, with some of the tops in the cattle at $70, cash has reached its peak yesterday," said Jason Roose, livestock analyst for U.S. Commodities Inc. On-feed cattle supplies are large and marketings are seen increasing into the summer. Friday's monthly USDA Cattle-on-Feed report is expected to confirm the larger than year ago on-feed numbers, they said. Estimates for seven-state major feedlots on feed averaged 107.6 percent and ranged from 106 to 108 percent of last year. Placements averaged 103.3 percent and ranged from 100.5 to 107 percent and marketings averaged 100.6 percent and ranged from 98 to 104.5 percent. Feeder cattle futures followed the lead of live cattle at times, but showed late stength on strong cash ideas. Cash feeders are seen showing strength into May and feed costs are expected to trend lower overall. The index has been hovering in the $70.50 to $71.00 area and is still expected to rise further, they said. Local short covering and buying by LFG supported May against selling by ABN Chicogo Corp and Refco and spreading of long August/short May by Cargill Investor Services. Cargill also spread long August and October feeders/short February live cattle, pit sources said. The latest CME feeder cattle index was off $0.06 at $70.59 per cwt. ((Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725))
MCAT	Thai raw sugar premiums firmed slightly this week on talk that Russia had entered the market and on further offtake by China, traders said. But the market expected the rise to be short-lived, with some estimating that as much as 40 percent of raws supply remained to be exported. Unless trading houses found markets for that sugar soon, premiums would be pressured further when Australian supply started hitting the market in July, they said. "All the output for 1996/97 was committed and is now in the hand of traders. However, some in the industry estimated that up to 40 percent of the raw sugar output has not been exported and that traders were yet to find markets for a large amount of that portion," said a dealer from a major trading firm. An executive at one sugar exporting firm said traders were pushing to sell to China, Russia and the Middle East and that some were trying to move into the Black Sea market, which is not a traditional outlet for Thai sugar. "If they fail, the premiums will head downward. But if they succeed, the sugar demand outlook next year in those regions could be affected," he said. "For Black Sea and Russia, I think we can still be competitive despite their distance. If the profit margin is not too bad, why not? The fact that we are punctual might be one of the reasons to win buyers over," he said. Thai raw sugar premiums for June/July delivery were bid without offers at 0.70 cent per pound over New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange (CSCE) futures on the FOB basis. The premium for July/August was quoted at 0.75/0.85 cents per pound on the same basis compared with 0.65/0.75 cents last week, traders said. So far, the only major sale to the Black Sea area was a recent 28,000 tonne consignment of raws to Ukraine. The vessel Anais Land departed from a Thai port on May 31. About 23,200 tonnes of raw sugar were shipped to China last week and a further 43,000 tonnes was expected to follow between next week and the end of June, traders and shipping sources told Reuters. The market is watching for any development of talk that China is expanding import licences of raw sugar for tolling. -- Bangkok newsroom (662) 652-0642

GCAT	Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko snubbed peace talks with his opponents organised by Moscow on Wednesday and refused to scrap a referendum on extending his powers. Lukashenko spoke for 40 minutes to President Boris Yeltsin, still recovering in hospital after a heart operation two weeks ago, but remained adamant that the referendum would go ahead on Sunday. "I will not give up the referendum. Thousands of people have already cast their votes. We will carry it to the end," he told electoral officials in Minsk. The talks in Smolensk, a Russian city halfway between Minsk and Moscow, went ahead without Lukashenko. His main opponent, parliament chairman Semyon Sharetsky, met Gennady Seleznyov and Yegor Stroyev, the leaders of Russia's two houses of parliament. Lukashenko's aides said he stayed away -- a slap in the face for Russia's mediation efforts -- because he was "very busy". "The president has decided not to go to Smolensk. He has an extremely tight schedule and so he has decided not to go," Mikhail Podgainy, head of information at the presidential administration, told Reuters. Lukashenko's closest aide, Vladimir Zametalin, said the president would not be going because Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, expected to attend, would not be there. However it was Chernomyrdin himself who first suggested the talks in a telephone conversation with Lukashenko on Tuesday. Aides said Lukashenko would spend Thursday campaigning in the Western city of Brest on the border with Poland, and might meet Chernomyrdin on Friday or Saturday. But Chernomyrdin's office said he would be spending Friday in Murmansk. The Belarus constitutional court, which like parliament has been at odds with Lukashenko for months, said it would start hearing parliament's impeachment case against him on Friday. Impeachment is unlikely however. A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to remove Lukashenko, who relies on support from a substantial minority of deputies. Sharetsky, before travelling to Smolensk, said parliament wanted Lukashenko to cancel the referendum, withdraw his proposed changes to the constitution and a series of illegal decrees, reinstate the sacked head of the Central Electoral Commission and give deputies television time. In return parliament would drop the impeachment moves. Sharetsky's press spokesman told Reuters that Yeltsin, who also spoke to him by telephone, had backed this "Zero Option" solution, but this could not be confirmed. Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Yeltsin's foreign affairs adviser Dmitry Ryurikov as saying political instability in Belarus would decline if the country could be integrated more closely with Russia. Lukashenko, recounting his own talk with the convalescent Russian president, said Yeltsin "admitted he was not sufficiently informed about the real situation in the republic." Interfax quoted Lukashenko as telling his parliamentary supporters the next step was up to his opponents and he would not back down until they withdrew the attempt to impeach him. Lukashenko's campaign for the referendum, in which early voting began on November 9, continued apace as the two sides spoke. Loudspeakers were heard in central Minsk, blasting out appeals to the population to vote and support Lukashenko. A defiant Lukashenko told his critics at a rally on Monday that he would not give up power to "adventurers" and they should prepare to "find another motherland" after the referendum. Lukashenko, who controls the security forces and most of the media and who enjoys considerable support among the mostly rural population of 10 million, has vowed to override any opposition. The presidents of neighbouring Lithuania, Ukraine and Poland issued a joint declaration on Wednesday expressing deep concern over the conflict in Belarus and calling for a constitutional solution and respect for human rights. The statement was signed by Poland's Aleksander Kwasniewski, Lithuania's Algirdas Brazauskas and Ukraine's Leonid Kuchma. The 42-year-old leader has scorned criticism from his neighbours and from the West but is heavily dependent on Russian economic support. He and Yeltsin agreed in April to unite their countries in a "community". Lukashenko is seeking authority to extend his term by more than two years and widen his powers over all institutions.
GCAT	Japan's new Democratic Party had a lead over the main opposition party in a poll published on Wednesday but both trailed the main government party. A survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, found 7.8 percent willing to vote for the Democratic Party, which will be formed later this month, while only 6.5 percent said they would vote for Shinshinto. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) scored the highest, with 22.4 percent. An overwhelming 49.4 percent of those polled said they were still undecided on which party to vote for. The survey covered 3,000 people nationwide over the weekend. Hashimoto is widely expected to call snap elections next month. The Democratic Party, to be headed by Yukio Hatoyama, former member of the smallest coalition partner Sakigake, and Health Minister Naoto Kan, hopes to group liberal forces from, among others, Sakigake and the Social Democratic Party, the two other members of the ruling coalition. Sakigake scored just 1.2 percent in the poll, the SDP 3.7 percent, communists 2.6 percent, others 1.7 percent and 4.7 percent did not respond. Meanwhile, support for Hashimoto's cabinet was largely unchanged at 41.0 percent, down only 0.5 percentage point from the previous poll conducted in June.

MCAT	CBOT corn futures closed mixed and was seeking direction amid conflicting signals from U.S. Midwest weather patterns and weather forecasts, traders said. "There are a lot of jitters in the market about weather. It's not all in the U.S. but also in China and India," said Smith Barney analyst Dale Gustafson. There were concerns about reports of dry weather in portions of China's grain growing region and the Indian monsoon was showing instability. In the U.S. there were forecasts early Wednesday for hotter weather by the weekend but midday outlooks from private forecasters showed more rain on the horizon. "Weather was going to be pretty warm this weekend. There was definite rain in northern parts of Iowa and in Minnesota and Wisconsin but they haven't been that dry," said Jerry Gidel, analyst for Dean Witter. "But southern and southwest Iowa on into Missouri it's going to stay pretty dry." Meteorologists early Wednesday said temperatures would climb above 90 degrees Fahrenheit in the U.S. Midwest this weekend and subside by early next week. Corn closed 3/4 cent lower to 3/4 higher, with September down 1/4 at $2.47-1/4.   Weather Services Corp Wednesday said high temperatures would range from the upper 80s to upper 90s Saturday through Monday and would be cooler Tuesday. This pattern will stress pollinating corn in some of the dry pockets of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Missouri, WSC said. Other areas will be generally favorable. The U.S. corn crop was pollinating slower-than-expected which led to increased vulnerability of the crop being harmed by a hot spell, analysts and traders have said. The crop as of Sunday was 21 percent pollinated, below the 22 percent a year ago and well below the 32 percent average pace. Strong commercial stopping of deliveries posted Wednesday against the expired July contract also was mentioned. "Cargill stopped beans, wheat and corn," a trader said. There were 590,000 bushels of corn posted Wednesday for delivery on the July and the Cargill Investor Services house account stopped all of it, according to the CBOT. Dean Witter bought four million bushels of December, Refco Inc bought seven million bushels of December and sold four million December and Merrill Lynch Futures sold two million December, traders said. In spread dealings, Cargill Inc did one million December/September at 1/2 cent, premium December, traders said. Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 50,000 contracts, below the 53,840 traded Tuesday. In corn options, Refco Inc sold 500 December $2.10 puts at 5/8 cent, sold 500 December $2.20 puts at 1-3/4 to 1-5/8 cents and bought 300 December $2.40 puts at 8-1/4 to 8-1/2 cents, traders said. Tenco Inc bought 500 September $2.50 puts at 8-1/2 cents and bought 500 September $2.30 calls at 19 cents, traders said. Corn options volume was estimated at 16,000 contracts, slightly above the 15,956 traded Tuesday. ((Sam Nelson 312-408-8721))

The company's turnover for 1996 was 1.647 billion levs. -- Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-91188 ($=1,570 levs)
GCAT	The European Commission said on Thursday it planned to propose legislation to reduce late payments on commercial transactions in the European Union. It said all EU governments should enforce minimum requirements, including a statutory right of creditors to interest on late payments. "Increasingly long payment periods have serious consequences for all European firms, whose cash-flow, profitability and competitiveness are undermined," the EU executive said in a statement. Only a limited number of EU countries took action following a 1995 Commission recommendation on the subject, it said. Small and medium-sized businesses were particularly hard hit, with deliberate delays hurting their competitive position as suppliers to large companies, it said. The Commission, which published a report on the question and asked for comments, cited a survey showing wide variations across the European Union in both contractually agreed credit periods and late payments. Contractual periods in 1996 averaged 19 days in Finland and 21 in Norway, but 75 days in Greece, 68 in Spain and 65 in Italy, it said. Average late periods ranged from six days in Norway and seven in Sweden and Denmark to 41 days in Portugal, 22 in Italy, 20 in Belgium and 19 in Greece, it added. "All efforts should be made to establish a climate in Europe where payments are made on time, and tackle the problems as a matter of urgency," EU Enterprise Policy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis said in the statement. Papoutsis said he would organise a hearing in October and propose legislation by the end of the year.

MCAT	Israeli shares closed sharply higher in active trading on Sunday amid high activity by institutional and foreign investors, traders said. The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 2.72 percent, or 6.60 points, to 248.94 on high all-share turnover of 175 million shekels against 165 million shekels on Thursday, the last day of trading before the Israeli weekend. The Maof 25 blue chip index closed 2.86 percent higher at 257.37. "This is unbelievable. The market looks very good and activity is high. There is no logical explanation for the rise beside the fact that the positive momentum continues," said Shahar Gazit at Batucha Securities and Investments. "We were surprised today by the market's strength. Last week the market has stabilized and now its ready for another rise. All the technical indicators are showing that this is a real bull market," said Eli Nahum, head of trading at Zannex Securities. Traders said that the main buyers were institutional and foreign investors. "The positive momentum continues but nobody knows if the market can continue rising. It's difficult to say where the market is going," Gazit said. "Now we have to see if the market is strong enough to break into new high ground above the Maof's all time high at 258.91," Nahum added. The most active shares were Koor Industries, which rose 3.0 percent to 32,980 agorot on volume of 12.7 million shekels; Israel Chemicals, which gained 3.5 percent to 355 agorot on turnover of nine million shekels; and Poalim Capital Markets and Investments, which surged 4.5 percent to 13,354 agorot on volume of 6.6 million shekels. - Dan Gerstenfeld, Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211

ECAT	A continued rise in energy prices boosted the overall producer price index (PPI) in November, but the more closely watched core rate barely rose, painting a benign picture of U.S. inflation, analysts said. "The report shows that core producer price inflation is well-behaved and any pressure that is out there is narrowly confined to the energy sector," said Raphael Marrone, money market economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. The Labor Department reported PPI rose 0.4 percent in November, but core PPI rose 0.1 percent.   Core PPI excludes volatile food and energy prices. "The divergence between food and energy prices and core prices has been an ongoing phenomenon this year," said Lee Youngdahl, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co Inc. Energy prices rose 2.3 percent in November, after rising 1.9 percent in October, the Labor Department reported. "It's something that bears watching because energy prices do influence the price of everything else, but future increases are likely to be more incremental," he added. Youngdahl says if modest U.S. growth rates continue, energy prices are unlikely to repeat their dramatic rise of 1996.   Strong crop yields in the fall helped food prices end their recent rise, economists said. Prices on consumer foods dropped by 0.1 percent in November, compared to a 0.8 percent rise in October. Despite the higher overall PPI number, the lower-than-expected 0.1 percent rise in core PPI grabbed economists' attention. The consensus forecast for core PPI had been for a rise of 0.2 percent.   Michelle Laughlin, Treasury market strategist for Prudential Securities Inc, noted that year-to-date, core PPI for 1996 was running at 0.6 percent which was close to reaching a record low. She said November's core rate was lower than many economists had expected because passenger car and light truck prices rose only 0.5 percent. "We were looking for a sharp swing in auto prices from the exagerated drop in October but instead they rose only moderately," Laughlin said.   Youngdahl said, "What makes this a pretty decent report is that it doesn't show any percolating pressures in the pipeline." He noted crude and intermediate goods prices, which often indicate the direction of future inflation, continued to remain low in November. Intermediate core goods rose by only 0.1 percent in November, while crude core goods registered their first decline in four months, falling by 0.3 percent, according to the Labor Department.   Nevertheless, Youndahl said he believed the short-term outlook for inflation would depend primarily on economic growth in the first half of 1997, which many market participants expect to show a rise from current levels. "If we see a surge (in GDP) to three percent or higher in the first half, inflationary pressures will start to show. These figures do not reflect that, however. We will have to wait and see," Youngdahl said. --Douglas Brown, 212-859-1662
CCAT	Iomega Corp. said Thursday it plans to apply its computer storage technology to handheld consumer electronics in a way that could lower the cost of saving and transfering data to such devices. The reusable data storage system, to be known as "n-hand," could be used in digital cameras, computer game devices, cellular phones and handheld personal computers known as digital assistants. In cameras, for example, the technology could function as a removable "digital film" that would replace existing chemical photographic film. "Our n-hand technology ... has the potential to change the way consumers use portable electronic devices," said Kim Edwards, president and chief executive of the Roy, Utah-based company, in a statement. "We are bringing personal computer-like storage to portable devices," added George Meyer, Iomega's director of marketing for new business, in a telephone interview. The n-hand disks are expected to be priced at less than $10 for a 20-megabyte disk, and could be available by the second half of 1997. Iomega said the n-hand disks are about half the size of a business card. Several industry analysts said they believe Iomega's technology could help propel digital cameras into the consumer mainstream within a matter of years, by freeing users from the fixed capacity of existing flash memory storage and by substantially reducing the overall cost of such cameras. A digital camera could store from 50 to 80 images on a single $10 n-hand disk, Iomega said, depending on image resolution. Consumers now pay hundreds of dollars for a flash memory card capable of holding the same number of images, it noted. Jim Porter, a data storage analyst with market research firm Disk/Trend Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., said the Iomega technology could cut the cost of storing photographs by a factor of 20 times. A Kodak digital camera costing $499 currently could be priced as low as $300 within a matter of years, he said, reflecting the elimination of more costly digital storage methods. Iomega's plans pose a theat to makers of flash memory chips that are used to store digital information in such small electronic devices currently. Leading makers including Sandisk Corp., Intel Corp. and Toshiba Corp. In addition, the Iomega system could help accelerate the current digital transformation of the camera industry, leading to a decline in revenues that cameramakers receive from conventional silver halide-based photo film and equipment. "With 'n-hand' you have a digital camera that you can treat like a regular camera," Meyer said, referring to the replaceable nature of the Iomega high-density floppy disk system. "This technology can make digital cameras much more competitive with regular ones," he said. Besides lacking a low-cost removable storage medium, digital cameras offer inferior picture quality but image resolution is improving rapidly, analysts said. This could lead to explosive growth of the new cameras in coming years. Shares of the company closed up $1.375 to $25.375 on active trading on Nasdaq. On Friday, Iomega's stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
CCAT	Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel said enough shareholders had attended an extraordinary general meeting on Thursday to hold a vote, expected after 1500 GMT, on a crucial 70 billion franc ($11.7 billion) debt restructuring plan. "The quorum of 25 percent has been reached," Eurotunnel executive chairman Patrick Ponsolle told the meeting. The company needs the approval of holders of two-thirds of the French shares and three-quarters of the British shares to pursue the deal struck in April to ease the crushing debt-servicing burden on the company. But the deal would also reduce shareholders' equity to 54.5 percent, giving Eurotunnel's creditor banks 45.5 percent. Before the meeting, Christian Cambier of the Eurotunnel Shareholders' Association said his group would vote in favour of the deal. It holds 2.5 percent of the shareholder votes. Another active shareholders' association, Adacte -- which holds some 12 million proxy votes out of the total 920 million -- opposes the debt restructuring, but the tide has recently turned in support of the deal. Last week the French and British governments said they would consider extending Eurotunnel's operating licence to 99 years from the current 65. They also said that if the debt deal was not approved, they would not be able to prevent the banks from taking over Eurotunnel's operating licence -- a declaration that swayed shareholder rights activist Sophie l'Helias. Others who have switched in favour of the deal include Bermuda-based Northern Cross Investments. Executive chairman Patrick Ponsolle has been mandated by 61,816 shareholders to vote on their behalf, the company said in a statement on Thursday but it did not indicate the size of their stakes. Ponsolle told the meeting the company was on track to improve its performance. He reiterated that it expected to show a loss of 2.72 billion francs this year, less than half the 1996 loss of 6.1 billion francs. The improvement hinges on the debt plan being approved which would lower interest charges to 3.2 billion francs for this year from 5.7 billion paid in 1996. He said he was "extremely confident" the group could reach the targets previously set to turn a profit in 2005 and pay a dividend the following year. Eurotunnel has been hobbled from the outset by a construction bill of 10 billion pounds, nearly twice the original cost estimate for the 51-km sub-sea link, and lower-than-targetted revenue. The agreement struck with the banks in April followed more than a year of negotiations. Shareholders were due to vote on the plan at a meeting on June 24 that was cancelled when not enough shareholders attended.
MCAT	Croatia's benchmark call money rate fell 50 basis points to 10 percent on Thursday on the unusually high supply of kuna funds, dealers said. "We've seen a strong rise in supply of kuna funds, and because of that the interest rate on call money loans fell to 10 percent from 10.5 percent," Jasenka Blagaic told Reuters. Blagaic said there was over 85 million kuna of fresh funds on offer against the demand of 13.5 million, which was fully met in the morning trade. Of those, call money loans accounted for 13 million, and the rest was one two-month loan granted to a savings bank at 18 percent a year. The overnight trade totalled 30.2 million, as one bank borrowed to maintain its mandatory reserves and one had shortfalls. -- Davor Huic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075
MCAT	The Montenegro Stock Exchange reported on Wednesday a 37 percent increase in its March turnover following two months of sharp declines and traders attributed the rise to an improved liquidity of banks. Total turnover jumped to 33.9 million dinars ($6.14 million) in 84 transactions, from 21.35 million dinars in 87 deals, the bourse said. Short-term securities accounted for 21 million dinars or 61.88 percent of the monthly total. Most securities carried a 0.4 percent daily interest while maturity ranged between 10 and 15 days. The Giro money market, where banks trade surplus liquidity, accounted for the remaining 12.9 million dinars of the total. "Liquidity of the banking sector has improved over the last month, but we can't say why, since there were no changes in the central bank's policy," a trader said. Turnover also rose after the Montenegrin Commodity Reserve Agency offered for sale bonds to finance preparations for the forthcoming tourist season, said Natasa Bulajic of the bourse. The bond issue was in line with the latest National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) changes in its reserve requirement regulation. Yugoslav commercial banks set aside 15 percent of their deposits and the same percentage of their interbank lending with the NBY to fulfil the reserve requirement. But since the end of February, the reserve requirement account in the NBY has been divided into two separate accounts, so that banks can use only 50 percent of the amount to bridge their daily liquidity problems. The other 50 percent is transferred to a special account and can be invested in securities issued by state-owned Serbian and Montenegrin commodity reserve agencies. Serbia needs funds to finance stockpiling of produce harvested late in 1996, while Montenegro will use money to finance preparations for the 1997 tourist season. The Montenegrin Commodity Reserve Agency issued 20 million dinars worth of 6-month bonds carrying an interest rate equivalent to the NBY discount rate set at a monthly 2.5 percent for April. In March alone, the agency sold 5.92 million dinars worth of bonds. But since March 18, banks are no longer allowed to buy bonds directly from the Commodity Reserve Agency. In future they will do the job via NBY. The Montenegro Stock Exchange also said NBY returned to the bourse with its short-term bonds for the first time in nearly nine months. The central bank offered for sale a 10 million dinar tranche of its 20-day bonds, to meet demand for its securities. But investors initially bought only 0.3 million worth of bonds. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254 ($1 = 5.5219 Yugoslav dinars)
ECAT	The Treasury's budget department, which is preparing various options for a second round of cuts in the 1997 budget, will not recommend raising taxes, Treasury sources said. But the sources noted that the budget department's proposal still needs the approval of Finance Minister Dan Meridor and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before being brought to the cabinet, therefore the final plan could include tax increases. The size of the additional cut will be determined next week, after budget and income data from November become available. But the sources said the amount of the cut could range from 1.5 billion to 2.3 billion shekels. The cabinet will meet on December 9 to vote on the additional cuts, which will then be sent to parliament for approval. Legislators are still haggling over the original 1997 budget proposal of 190.8 billion shekels, which included 4.9 billion shekels in cuts. The budget department will present to Netanyahu two options for the second round of cuts. One will include detailed suggestions for cuts from each ministry while the other will determine only the amount to be cut from each ministry and leave it up to the ministers to decide how to implement the cuts. According to the budget department's plan, the additional cuts would fall most heavily on housing and social welfare spending, the sources said.

ECAT	The Reserve Bank of Australia on Friday cut official interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 5.5 percent -- its fourth cut in less than a year. The bank has been under increasing political pressure to cut rates after the government released its 1997/98 budget 10 days ago, arguing economic growth and low inflation had set the scene for lower rates.   The central bank said it had decided to cut interest rates because it believed underlying inflation, now at 2.0 percent, would fall in the coming quarter. The bank also said forecast strong economic growth in 1997 and fiscal tightening in the government's budget also contributed to the cut. Rates were last cut in December last year when the official cash rate was brought down to 6.0 percent from 6.5 percent.   The central bank said it had decided to cut interest rates because it believed underlying inflation, now at 2.0 percent, would fall in the coming quarter. The bank said forecast strong economic growth in 1997 and fiscal tightening in the government's budget also contributed to the cut. Economic growth, currently 3.25 percent, is forecast to reach 3.75 percent in the 1997/98 fiscal year. "The above considerations -- namely, inflation forecast to fall below two percent, and economic activity providing scope for further expansion -- amount to a 'prima facie' case for an easing in policy," the bank said in a statement.   The Australian dollar slumped more than three quarters of a U.S. cent in hectic morning trade after the rate cut caught much of the market by surprise. By 9.40 a.m. (2340 GMT) the dollar had dived to US$0.7680/85, its lowest level since mid-February, from US$0.7761/66 just ahead of the bank's announcement. Shares rose strongly on the news, especially bank stocks. The All Ordinaries stock market index hit a record 2,565.5 points, up 17.6 points. "I am surprised that they have done this," said Chris Richardson, director of Access Economics.   "I would have expected no change until early 1998 when I would have expected rates to go up on the basis of very rapid growth in the United States, translating into rapid growth here and adding to inflation," he said. Rates were last cut in December last year when the official cash rate was brought down to 6.0 percent from 6.5 percent.
ECAT	Ecuador's Consumer Price Index rose by 6.4 percent in January, up from 2.4 percent in the same month last year, the National Statistics and Census Institute said Friday. Cumulative inflation for the past 12 months was 30.53 percent. Inflation in Ecuador was 25.5 percent in 1996, up from 22.8 percent the year before. In December, Ecuador's consumer prices rose 1.29 percent. The government expects to close 1997 with an inflation rate of around 20 percent. ((--Gustavo Oviedo, Quito Newsroom, 5932 258433))

CCAT	A new cargo airline has been formed to dodge the air freight bottlenecks in Miami by utilising belly hold capacity in passenger planes taking tourists to Barbados, Cargo Link Caribbean Ltd commercial director Peter Brooks told Reuters. "Miami airport is traditionally fairly full at this time of year and we should be able to offer a very competitive service in terms of both speed and price," Brooks said. The first flight on the new link was operated northbound from Santiago on Thursday this week linking with two British Airways flights returning to London Gatwick and carried 37 tonnes of freight. Recently cargo, especially from Europe, has waited for upto a week in Miami awaiting transhipment to Latin America. Cargo Link plans take advantage of spare Caribbean belly capacity for freight moving between Latin America and Europe, Canada or the U.S.. "Our rates will be competitive with both direct flights to Latin America as well as those that currently go via Miami," he added. "We won't have a surcharge, but we can't control what surcharges may be imposed by the airlines whose belly capacity we will be utilising," Brooks said. Cargo Link, which is registered in Barbados, has wet leased a DC-8-54F with a payload of 43 tonnes which will fly between Bridgetown and Latin American airports. Initially, the service will comprise separate flights to Santiago and Guatemala and a linked one to Quito and Lima. If the concept proves successful more destinations and planes could be added, Brooks said. The first flight northbound from Santiago to Bridgetown took place Thursday, November 21 and the first to Quito and Lima will be on Friday, November 29. The first flight to Guatemala is scheduled for Monday, December 2. Apart from Bvritish Airways Cargo Link is in discussion with American Airlines, Air Canada and LTU of Dusseldorf to use spare capacity in their flights carrying tourists to and from the Caribbean. Brooks said he is keen to talk to all airlines flying top Bridgetown. Cargo Link will subcontract ground handling to a local agent agent at Bridgetown where the small size of the airport means transhipment times can be little as two hours, Brooks said. The heavy volume of passenger flights with spare freight capacity means that in most cases the overall volume handled by Cargo Link will be determined by the capacity of its wet lease. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
CCAT	Construction company Engil-SGPS is expected to report a consolidated net profit of 600 to 650 million escudos ($4.0-4.3 million) in the first half, flat on last year but below initial forecasts, analysts said. But they said that the company, which is expected to announce six month figures within a few days, was still on target to reach a full-year profit of 1.5 billion escudos, compared with 1.18 billion in 1995. "I am looking for close to 650 (million escudos), below the 750 million that were being forecast at the start of the year," said Pedro Andrada of brokers Fincor. First half profit in 1995 was 586 billion escudos. But Andrada said the company could still reach the 1.5 billion profit target for the whole year. "The 1.5 billion seems reasonable...because the second half is usually better," added Joao Pereira of Gesfinc. "We have been recommending it as a buy for some time," he said. The construction sector got off to a slow start in 1996 because of heavy winter rains and the fact that the 1996 budget only came into effect in April because of the change of government at the end of the previous year. Most analysts expect that the construction sector will outperform the overall economy in 1996 and from the stock market perspective Engil had the advantage of being one of the most liquid construction stocks.

GCAT	Burma's military government on Saturday showed no sign of relaxing restrictions on the movements of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The government said bombing incidents in Rangoon this week required its vigilance on security. A military spokesman said he could not say when the government would ease its requirement that the Nobel Peace laureate seek advance military permission to leave her lakeside residence in central Rangoon. Two bombs exploded at a Buddhist site in a northern Rangoon suburb on Wednesday, killing five people and wounding 17. Asked when the military would allow Suu Kyi's free movement, the spokesman said: "Under the current situation, it is very hard to say...We still have to be extra careful." The ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) on Friday allowed Suu Kyi to leave her house for the first time in three weeks. The opposition leader visited the tomb of her mother Khin Kyi at a cemetery on the eighth anniversay of her death. Tin Oo, deputy leader of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), said she and NLD members held a 15-minute Buddhist prayer service at the tomb. The SLORC had since December 3 restricted Suu Kyi's movement after nearly 2,000 university students took to the streets at the start of a series of the biggest anti-government demonstrations seen in Rangoon since 1988. Tin Oo said Suu Kyi had no specific plans to leave her compound next week as she did not like to ask for what she regarded as her legal right to freedom of movement. Suu Kyi and the student protesters have denied any political links but the government has accused some NLD members, exiled students and outlawed Burmese communists of instigating the protests. The government had blamed this week's bomb blasts on the exiled All-Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF) and the rebel Karen National Union (KNU). The ABSDF has denied any link to the bomb attack. The bombs exploded at different places at the Buddhist site, where thousands of pilgrims had gathered to pay homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic, which was on loan from China. The second explosion caused all the deaths and injuries. A commentary in state-run newspapers on Saturday said the bombing incidents could not harm Burmese-Chinese relations. It said: "China and Myanmar have been united since they were born. Those wishing to obstruct the greatness of Sino-Myanmar relations have caused explosions and destruction." The papers quoted Russian ambassador Valeri Nazarov as saying: "This unprecedentedly cynical act of terrorism can cause nothing but the strongest feelings of shock, indignation and protest."
GCAT	After coming through a pressure-packed Olympic year with gold and glory, track superstar Michael Johnson is planning to have more fun in 1997. "I'm going to take it easy through the year and not be under any pressure, just go out and run and have fun this year," Johnson said Monday at a luncheon hosted by his management company. Johnson earned his place among the track immortals last summer when he became the first man ever to win gold at both 200 and 400 meters at the same Olympics, racing to an astonishing world record of 19.32 seconds in the 200 and an Olympic record of 43.49 in the 400 in Atlanta. But the enormous pressure of the U.S. Olympic trials and competing at the Games after his disappointment in Barcelona four years earlier put a damper on Johnson's enjoyment level. "Last year was fun, but I wasn't able to have fun while I was doing it. I was able to have fun after the races were over," said Johnson, who plans to sit out the indoor athletics season this year. Johnson said he expects to get back to competition in late April with a 400 meter race somewhere in the United States, followed by a couple of 200 meter races in May. The highlight of his season prior to the world championships in Athens, however, will likely be a made-for-television match race against Olympic 100 meters champion Donovan Bailey, set for June 1 in Toronto. While the mythical moniker of "world's fastest man" is traditionally bestowed upon the Olympic 100 meters gold medalist, Canadians were stung by Games commentators using that phrase to descrive Johnson after his Atlanta heroics. The two will race over the unconventional distance of 150 meters, with $1 million going to the winner and $500,000 to the loser. While he expects to win, Johnson doesn't believe the race will settle the dispute. "To be honest, I'll prove on that day, at that given time I could beat Donovan Bailey at 150 meters," Johnson said. "Everybody else will make up their mind as to whether that means I'm the fastest man in the world. But there is no way to prove that because it is not like going out to get a gold medal or a world record, which both of us holds," he said. "It is just entertainment to the people and it's a great opportunity for the sport." Attaining such lofty goals last year has done little to diminish Johnson's taste for winning. "In order to remain a great athlete you got to compete every year and compete well," he said. "You don't want to be second best in your event, that's a really big thing. You want to go out and win. "It's always go out and win."
MCAT	Most of the 2.0 billion stg of gilts snapped up at Wednesday's auction have gone to safe hands and the market can track the confident mood in international bond markets without fear of a stock overhang, analysts and dealers say. The market is also pricing in a couple more increases in Britain's 6.75 percent official interest rates so even the possibility of another tightening next month is unlikely to put more than a short-term dampener on sentiment, they add. The Bank of England's auction of the 8.0 percent 2021 bonds was oversubscribed with cover at 2.32 times the stock on offer and a yield tail of just one basis point. "We had the usual demand you'd expect for the long end  -- the pension funds and the insurers but there was also some international interest which took a few people by surprise," one gilt salesman at a UK market maker said. Earlier in the week, many players had been looking for cover of three times but this morning's surge in gilt prices of more than half a point at one stage may have persuaded some operators the market was looking slightly expensive. "The good part is the short tail, but the disappointing part is the cover. The market had broadly expected something significantly higher than 2.32. This could partly be explained by the fact that there has been a rally this morning and that might have put off some marginal bidders," said Andrew Davies, gilts analyst of London Bond Broking. September gilt futures set a series of new contract highs, toppling the previous best level of 115-5. The contract's highest price by 1230 GMT was 115-20. Comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan that the U.S. economy was slowing down and that inflation in 1997 would be quite modest sent international bond markets sharply higher. "This morning's rally is going to make additional gains hard from where we are now," said BZW bond economist Kevin Adams. But he argued that the market was likely to retain its firmer tone relative to other markets. The gilt/Bund spread narrowed to 156 basis points from 160 at Tuesday's close. "I think the spread against Germany is likely to remain pretty well underpinned. We could even see it come in further as some of the EMU stories start to come home to roost and people start to wonder exactly what sort of foundation EMU is going to have," he said. Fears that decisions on which countries are eligible for a entry for European Monetary Union will be taken on political not economic grounds is giving the UK which, has an opt out from EMU, the allure of a safe haven. Moreover, the UK market already has a tremendous amount of bearish news priced in -- witnessed by its resilience in the face of the unexpected strength of June retail sales data published today. June retail sales grew by an annual 5.4 percent, compared with expectations of just 4.5 percent, fuelling fears that the Bank of England will opt to increase Britain's 6.75 percent interest rates at the August 6-7 monetary meeting - the fourth monthly increase in succession. Adams argues the Bank will hold off a little longer because although sales are undoubtedly strong, consumers remain resistant to price increases which should keep the lid on inflation. "Even when rates do go up, that will be seen as very pre-emptive and won't have much impact very far out along the (UK yield) curve. It will simply drag the inversion shorter." The market will be looking for further clues on the timing of any further rise in UK rates in this afternoon's testimony from central Bank Governor Eddie George to a parliamentary committee at 1515 GMT. HSBC economist Jonathan Loynes said the gilt market could be under-estimating the probable strength of UK data over the next few months and 10-year yields could move back above seven percent and perhaps even to 7.25, compared with 6.94 now. "The market seems to have changed tack over the last week or so and seems to have started worrying more about the long-term outlook than the here and now. The "r" word (recession) has even popped up. Several bits of strong data over the next few months could bring us back to earth," he said. "But we're still pretty optimistic by the end of the year -- we're looking for yields of about 6.75 percent but the market might have a bit of a tricky patch to get through first," he said. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109
MCAT	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to further ease liquidity, sparking a fall in interest rates and boosting depressed equity markets, bankers and analysts said on Monday. Heads of leading state-run Indian banks meet RBI Governor Chakravarty Rangarajan on October 19 to discuss the central bank's monetary policy for the second half of 1996/97 (April-March). The policy is scheduled to be released on the same day. "The crucial task before the RBI is to lower interest rates," said P.H. Ravikumar, senior vice-president at ICICI Banking Corporation. Interest rates for top-rated borrowers range from 15.5 percent per annum charged by leading state-run Indian banks to 18.5-19.0 percent by private and foreign banks. "Most bankers feel that liquidity will tighten in the months to come and this is keeping interest rates high," he said. "A strong signal has to be conveyed to the market that interest rates are on the downswing," Ravikumar said. "This can be achieved by a cut in the cash reserve ratio for banks," he said. The RBI has already cut banks' cash reserve requirements by two percentage points in the current year, releasing 79 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) to banks. The ratio is currently at 12 percent. Banks are currently enjoying a comfortable liquidity position. RBI data released on Monday showed a deposit growth of 279.26 billion rupees against a 30.66 billion rupee decline in advances for the banking industry so far this year. "In such a situation, if cash reserve requirements are cut further this will be a strong signal to the banking industry to bring down interest rates," Ravikumar said. "A lot is expected of the RBI this time," said K. Kannan, chairman and managing director of state-run Bank of Baroda. "I have not seen expectations of such a high order before." He said the central bank might have to assist in reviving depressed equity markets as this was critical for the government's divestment programme. The government has said it plans to raise 50 billion rupees through the sale of shares in state-owned firms. Analysts feel this is unlikely, given the depressed state of the equities market reeling under fears about political stability and an expected slowdown in company earnings for the first half of 1996/97. The Bombay Stock Exchange's top 30 share index was at 3,100 in late Monday trade, down from a 1996 high of 4,069 on June 18. It touched a record 4,628 in September 1994. "I feel the limits on bank investments in shares and debentures may be increased," said Amit Rajpal, banking analyst at Prime Broking. At present banks are allowed to invest five percent of their incremental deposits each year in shares and debentures of companies. Rajpal said this could be increased to 10 percent, increasing the funds available for investment. ($1=35.65 rupees) -- Bombay newsroom +91-22-265 9000
MCAT	COMEX copper ended weaker in lackluster rangebound trade as new, lower margins came in force after close of trade. The New York market was quiet and dominated by local activity with LME was closed Monday due to a U.K. public holiday. LME reopens Tuesday but with no regular stock report. The COMEX copper margin per futures contract was cut to $1,600 from $2,100 for clearing members, members and hedgers, and to $2,160 from $2,835 for speculators. "In theory this should be more supportive for copper," said Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential Securities. The margins were raised on COMEX and LME to dampen post-Sumitomo volatility. December COMEX settled 0.40 cent lower at 89.60 cents, traded 89.90 to 89.45 cents. September went out 0.60 cents weaker at 91.10 cents. Volume was estimated at 4,000 lots. The market appeared to shrug off uncertainties in labor talks at Phelps Dodge's Chino mine where the contract expired June 30, at Codelco's Salvador mine, where the current deal ends September 1, and at Kennecott which expires at end of September, Raptopoulos noted. -- Huw Jones, New York Commodities 212-859-1646
MCAT	NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures ended steady to higher Wednesday in a lackluster session, then moved a bit higher on ACCESS after weekly AGA stock data showed a lower-than-expected build, industry sources said. Earlier, Dec gained 6.9 cents to close at $2.864/mmBtu, then climbed on ACCESS to a new high of $2.88 after the AGAs. But the rally was short-lived, as Dec prices soon drifted back to the mid-$2.80s. January settled up five cents at $2.828. "The first reaction to the (AGA) report was short covering, but now it looks like profit taking," said one Midwest trader, noting cold weather expectations have buoyed prices this week.   AGA said Wednesday that U.S. gas inventories rose last week by 34 bcf to 85 percent of capacity, still 256 bcf or nine percent below year-ago levels. Eastern stocks climbed to 95 percent full, about even with last year, while producing region storage at 73 percent still lagged 1995 by 16 points. An earlier Reuter poll showed most expected a weekly build of 43-50 bcf. While technical traders said the market was overbought and due for a pullback after a 12 percent rally in four sessions, fundamental traders said cold weather later this week and next could keep early-November cash firm and underpin the board. December support was still seen in the $2.66 area and then in the low-$2.50s. Resistance remained at the $2.88 contract high and then at $2.92 and $2.98, two prominent spot continuation highs set in late June and early July. Cash sources said November prices Wednesday were notional at best, with most sidelined waiting for next month's flows to begin. Early-November Midcon climbed almost a dime to the mid-to-high $2.70s on prospects for well-below normal weather in the region this week. November Gulf Coast gas was talked up a couple of cents to the $2.70-2.75 area but no deals were reported to confirm levels. New York city gate gas prices notionally slipped slightly to the high $3.20s. The 12-month Henry Hub strip rose 1.2 cents to $2.279. NYMEX said 35,974 Hub contracts traded, up from Tuesday's revised tally of 32,327. NYMEX Alberta natgas closed 1.5 cents higher at a new contract high of $1.23, while deferreds again were untraded but settled steady to up one cent. NYMEX said 16 Alberta contracts traded compared with 38 on Tuesday. NYMEX December Permian natgas was untraded but ended up 15 cents at $2.69. NYMEX said 45 Permian lots changed hands versus 80 on Tuesday. On the KCBT, December finished eight cents higher at $2.71, while deferreds ended steady to up six cents. The December East/West spread narrowed by 0.9 cent to 15.4 cents (NYMEX premium). --J Silha, New York Power Desk 212-859-1624
ECAT	Big tax cuts without spending reductions would risk taking the U.S. economy back to where it was five years ago where the budget deficit was one of the major barriers to global growth, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said on Friday. "Large-scale, multi-hundred billion dollar, tax cuts -- if not paid for with spending reductions -- would...do tremendous damage by taking us back to the situation five years ago where the U.S. budget deficit was one of, if not the, largest problem thwarting the healthy growth of the global economy," Summers told bankers at a luncheon in Singapore.   Summers said it was a political as well as a social judgement rather than an economic judgement whether there are ways of cutting spending acceptable to the United States as a society that would be consistent with those large cuts. "On the evidence of the spending cuts that were necessary to finance (U.S. House Republican Speaker) Newt Gingrich's tax cuts...I don't think that there is a politically or socially acceptable way of financing very large-scale across-the-board tax cuts," he said. He added it was unfortunate that large scale tax cuts were advocated without specific details of which programmes would be reduced to pay for them.
GCAT	President Bill Clinton said on Friday he expected to face "tough" issues like NATO expansion in talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin this month but voiced hope for progress during their two-day summit. Clinton and Yeltsin begin talks on March 19 in Helsinki, a neutral site chosen to spare the Russian leader any undue physical strain following his heart surgery last year and a bout with double pnemonia this year. "It'll be a meeting that'll be extremely candid, extremely ... straightforward," Clinton told a televised news conference from the East Room of the White House. "I expect that the Helsinki meeting will be positive," he said. "But you should understand that this is a tough debate and that they have reasons in their own psyche and circumstances that make it a difficult one." Yeltsin has been particularly troubled by NATO plans to expand the alliance by extending an invitation in July to some former East Bloc nations. Washington has been trying to reassure Moscow that expansion would pose no military threat and Clinton said at his news conference that NATO wants "a special relationship with Russia and does not rule out even Russian membership in a common security alliance." In his upcoming summit, he said, "the best answer I can give to President Yeltsin is, what are we doing with NATO and with whom are we doing it." He noted that the United States has been actively engaged it trying to maintain a peace in Bosnia. "We together ended the bloodiest war in Europe since World War II and we are doing it with Russia," he said. U.S. and European diplomats have been working behind the scenes to allay Russian concerns about expansion of NATO, noting that once invitations were issued it would take several years before the alliance actually was enlarged. Invitations to join NATO are expected to be issued at a July summit of the alliance to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Clinton said he hoped the Helsinki summit "will deal with not only the question of Russia's relationship to Europe but also what we can do with the Russians to continue to reduce the nuclear threat and what we can do with the Russians to help them to build their economy." Despite Russia's struggle to adopt to a free market economy he said he was "convinced that they have the capacity, if they can make certain changes, to enjoy a phenomenal amount of economic growth in a relatively short time." Clinton, sounding confident heading into the talks with Yeltsin, declared that "we're trying to work together for a better, brighter world." After the summit concludes on March 20, Clinton will visit Copenhagen and then head back to Washington on March 21.
MCAT	CBOT wheat futures dropped to new contract lows early on concerns about news the karnal bunt fungus had been detected in some Tennessee wheat, traders said. Pressure also came from prospects the European Union Thursday will increase the amount of export subsidies on their wheat exports, they said. The new low for March is $3.70 per bushel, down from the previous low of $3.74 set Wednesday. At 0943 CDT, wheat was one to four cents per bushel lower, with December down 3-1/2 at $3.77-1/2.

MCAT	The Tokyo stock market's key index jumped to a new high for calendar 1997 on Thursday morning on continued optimism over the economy after a survey that showed a surprisingly upbeat mood among big manufacturers. After 15 minutes of trade the Nikkei 225 average was up 188.42 points or 0.91 percent at 20,867.69 after briefly rising to 20,882.19. The previous intra-day high for the year was set on June 13, when the Nikkei rose to 20,815.48. Its September futures added 110 points to reach 20,870. Brokers said gains were likely to be limited as euphoria stemming from the Bank of Japan's "tankan" survey of corporate sentiment could not last. The survey's release on Wednesday lifted investor confidence on the Tokyo bourse, wafting prices higher. "The near-term goal for the Nikkei is 20,800 as there are not enough factors apart from a good supply-demand situation to keep the index rising to 21,000 and beyond," a general manager at a foreign brokerage said.
CCAT	Hong Kong property tycoon Stanley Ho said on Wednesday he did not expect the territory's future government to launch droconian measures to crack down on the residential property market. "I am confident that the future government will be very discreet and will not be ready to take harsh measures to deal a blow on the property market," Ho, chairman of property developer Shun Tak Holdings Ltd, told reporters. The British colony reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30. The post-colonial government is expected to launch measures to curb soaring residential prices. The Bank of China said in a quarterly report published on Wednesday that the long-term cure for Hong Kong's high property prices would be to increase housing supply, but new taxes could also be imposed to check speculation. Hong Kong's future chief executive Tung Chee-hwa has said problems in the territory's pricey residential property market would be at the top of his agenda after he assumed his position on July 1. Ho, who is also president of the Real Estate Developers Association of Hong Kong, said too much government interference would be undesirable. "Too much control or interference will not do us any good," he said. "The free market must be maintained. Hong Kong is successful because we have a free market based on supply and demand. And speculation is not that serious in the sector." Developers take measures to check the participation of speculators when they put projects on the market, he said. "We do not like speculators ourselves. We hope that the market will contine to be steady and there is small growth -- and that's all we want," Ho said. The association hoped to see no interference into the free market, and was opposed to the introduction of new taxes and any executive measure similar to those launched in 1994, he said. In 1994, the government launched a package of measures to cool the overheated sector, including raising the minimum initial sales deposit on new flats and outlawing the resale of uncompleted flats before they are assigned. Ho expressed optimism over the future of Hong Kong. "I am very confident that after the handover, Hong Kong will continue to grow and I am really very optimistic," he said. "Besides, I think that many of the leaders told me that they must try to do better than the English," he added. Ho said he expected no immediate changes after handover. "I think everything will be as usual." -- Carrie Lee (852) 2843 6590
MCAT	KCBT hard red winter wheat futures closed mostly higher, supported primarily by commercial buying, dealers said. May was the strongest contract amid mill-related buying while March was weaker as longs rolled forward positions ahead of first notice day Friday. Few deliveries were expected. "There is a lack of deliverable wheat," one dealer said. Floor sources said Cargill Investor Services, Shay Grain and E.D. & F. Man International were featured buyers.

GCAT	Slovenia, one of Europe's most stable and prosperous ex-communist states, faces an uncertain future following an inconclusive election which gave neither left nor right a clear mandate to run the country. A rightwing alliance, bent on unseating centre-left Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, was likely to be denied an absolute majority in parliament by just one seat. But Sunday's general election also dealt Drnovsek a difficult pack, leaving his Liberal Democrats with most votes but without an obvious coalition partner. The outcome could complicate the former Yugoslav republic's bid to join the European Union, with the right less keen than Drnovsek to join the Brussels club without rock-solid guarantees to protect such sectors as farming. "We are a little worried because the right may slow down the whole process of Slovenia's integration into the European Union," a Ljubljana-based Western European diplomat said. Markets are also worried that the right may put the brakes on an already-sluggish privatisation process and scare off would-be foreign investors. "After being the golden child of transition, people are looking more closely at Slovenia," said Heather Grabbe, European programme research fellow at London's Royal Institute for International Affairs. "Slovenia is doing well but it has a long way to go. Industrial restructuring is difficult...and the EU is paying particular attention to protectionism," Grabbe said. Whether Slovenia would hit its target date of 2001 for EU entry was an open question, she added. The rightist People's Party, the biggest winner among the three parties of the so-called "Slovenian Spring" alliance, has made clear it wants Slovenia's farmers in particular to be shielded from the full rigours of EU competition. Most parties back Slovenia's membership of the NATO military alliance in its first expansion eastwards. Unofficial results gave 45 seats in the 90-member assembly to the alliance, which also includes the centre-right Social Democrats and Christian Democrats. Final official results were expected on Friday. Chances were receding of the right being allocated an extra seat after final calculations in the complicated proportional voting system, pointing to political stalemate. Behind-the-scenes bartering has begun but the rightist alliance was holding firm just a hair's breadth from power. "A right-wing government would be unstable even if it gets a majority," Britain-based Slovenian political analyst Drago Lavrencic said. "There would be a lot of changes in Slovenia if Drnovsek goes." Drnovsek, 46, president of former Yugoslavia between 1989 and 1990, is considered an astute political operator. With 25 parliamentary seats, Drnovsek knows he cannot rule without persuading one of the rightwing parties to defect and join him in a new coalition government. If he does succeed, Drnvosek's new administration would have in any case to shift policy to the right to tackle the big spending cuts and industrial restructuring necessary for EU entry and European economic and monetary union. "If the "Spring' alliance forms a government it will be very fragile and would not last six months and would lead to early elections," said Igor Luksic, professor of politics at Ljubljana University. "But I still think Drnovsek has it in him to win parties over to him and form the next government."
MCAT	U.S. Midwest direct hog prices Monday were seen selling steady with a weak tone amid ideas weekend rainfall may stall fieldwork and free farmers to market hogs, resulting in large runs, livestock dealers said. Cash hog prices also were said to be vulnerable as this week's price advance outran pork gains and eroded packer operating margins, which could lead to slaughter cutbacks, they said. Hog marketings also could escalate Monday if early prices are lower, dealers said. Lower prices could spark panic selling of hogs producers may have been holding back.   "Nothing like a $0.50 or $1.00 lower opening after a week of higher prices to get people to unload the hogs they've been holding back," one hog buyer said. Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota top prices for hogs delivered to plants on Monday could range from $57.00 to $57.50. Friday's price of $57.50 was $3.00 higher than a week ago, USDA statistics showed. Illinois top prices at plants were seen steady at $57.50. Friday's top of $57.50 was $2.50 higher for the week. Indiana/Ohio top prices for hogs delivered to the plant could also range $57.00 to $57.50. The Indiana/Ohio cash hog top of $57.50 Friday also was up $2.50, compared with a week ago.

GCAT	Weeping mothers marched through downtown Bogota on Thursday, calling for the release of their soldier sons captured by leftist guerrillas more than a month ago. Thirty-five mothers paraded photos of their loved ones, who were among the more than 60 seized by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as prisoners of war in the jungles of southern Colombia on Aug. 30. Some blamed the army for sending their sons, little more than raw recruits, into a combat zone. Others urged prayers for the FARC, saying the rebels' fight was with the government, not their boys. "This situation is destroying my heart. Only God knows the pain a mother feels when her son is kidnapped," said Hermencia Vargas, mother of 19-year-old Edwin Sierra from Florencia in southern Caqueta province. As the 1,000-strong march snaked past graffiti declaring "Long live Communism" and "Yanks go home," a flock of pigeons rose into the air -- would-be doves of peace. Communist guerrillas rose up in arms more than three decades ago in Colombia. But the attack on Aug. 30 in which more than 27 soldiers died caught the military off guard and signalled the start of the bloodiest rebel offensive in recent memory. The International Committee of the Red Cross is mediating the prisoner crisis. In line with the FARC's demands, President Ernesto Samper this week agreed to allow an international delegation to witness the eventual handover of the soldiers.
CCAT	Chubb Corp declined comment on a published report that a company run by Patriot American Hospitality Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Paul Nussbaum has agreed in principle to acquire the assets of Chubb's real estate unit. The Wall Street Journal said Patriot American Management & Leasing Co, a private firm, had agreed in principle to acquire Chubb's Bellemead Development Corp for about $1 billion. Patriot American was not available for comment.   Last Friday Chubb said it had entered into an agreement with a prospective buyer to perform due diligence and that it anticipated executing a contract for the sale of substantially all of its commercial properties. In October Chubb said it had hired Goldman Sachs to help it evaluate strategic options for its life insurance and real estate businesses. Last month Chubb reached a definitive agreement to sell its life insurance business to Jefferson-Pilot Corp for $875 milion cash.
GCAT	China on Friday opposed growing calls for a total ban on anti-personnel landmines, saying they were an effective means of self-defence. "To many countries, especially those that have a long land border, landmines remain an effective weapon of self-defence," ambassador Sha Zukang said. Addressing the General Assembly's disarmament and international security committee, he said all states were entitled under the U.N. Charter to use legitimate military means to protect their security. "The Chinese people have not forgotten how landmines, during the eight long years of war against the invasion of Japanese fascists, raised havoc among the invaders, thus playing an important role in China's triumph in the war," said Sha, China's envoy for disarmament affairs. "A film depicting that part of history entitled 'Landmine Warfare' is very popular in China and is loved by all the Chinese people." He said China had always taken seriously the humanitarian concerns raised by landmines. They supported efforts by the international community aimed at preventing the killing and maiming of innocent civilians and agreed that reasonable and appropriate restrictions should be applied, particularly on the use of anti-personnel mines. "The proposal to ban all anti-personnel landmines, an assumption based on an over-exaggeration of humanitarian concerns and the total disregard of the specific situations of other countries and the military utility of landmines, is unjustifed. We cannot agree with it," he said.
ECAT	The following are analysts' comments on Portugal's February inflation data, which rose 0.2 percent from January's 0.3-percent gain. Year-on-year February inflation was up 2.9 percent from up 3.3 percent, previously: MARTIN AMARAL NETO, BANCO ESSI: "It's a good number. It's what we expected, and it will favour a fall in short-term rates, both money market rates and Portuguese bond rates. The number underlines the absence of inflationary pressures and the downward trend in inflation. The Bank of Portugal has room to cut rates, but a decision will depend on the progress of non-tradable goods prices."   JOAO MIGUEL LOURENCO, SIEMCA "The inflation number was at the lower end of expectations and is a good result. I think that it makes the government's objective for inflation for 1997 (2.25-2.5 percent) more credible. Although the Bank of Spain cut rates today, I think the Bank of Portugal will adopt a more cautious attitude and will not cut rates soon because of exchange rate instability."   JORGE FERRAZ, INFORMACAO DE MERCADOS FINANCEIROS "It is a good number. I think it makes room for the Bank of Portugal to cut rates. Our rates are higher than Spain's and so with Spain's rate cut today we are further behind. I think it is too early for the government to revise its 1997 inflation target.

CCAT	British insurer Commercial Union Plc said on Tuesday that worldwide new business rose 21 percent to 1.58 billion stg in the first six months of 1997. New single premiums were up 17 percent to 1.22 billion stg over the period and new annual premiums up 38 percent to 154 million stg.   Chief executive John Carter described the performance as very good. "Our Netherlands company, Delta Lloyd, and our UK business produced strong growth and an excellent level of new business was achieved in Italy and Poland," he said. Single premium business at Delta Lloyd increased 51 percent to 120 million stg and annual premium new business 31 percent higher at 33 million stg. However, Commercial Union said that consumer uncertainty surrounding the recent elections and the reorganisation of the sales force in France had an adverse effect on sales there. Single premium sales in France amounted to 624 million stg, including a 295 million stg contribution from AFER, down 15 percent after adjusting for exchange rate movements. Annual premium sales were 11 million, down 30 percent. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5106

GCAT	China is to restart horse races that were halted in 1987 because of poor equipment and shortages of capital, a sports official said on Thursday. The '96 China Cup Horse-Racing Open would be held next month in Guangzhou, capital of southern Guangdong province, Huang Wei, vice-secretary of the China Horsemanship Association, told Reuters by telephone. China halted sport horse-racing nine years ago because of poor conditions at race tracks, but races held for audiences willing to bet on the outcome were permitted to continue. Gambling is illegal in China, but race course owners say their activities are within the law because punters win a fixed percentage of the takings for each race. Conditions at the Guangzhou track had been much improved since 1987, Huang said, adding that betting would be forbidden at the races. "This is a sports activity... we do not have any activities involving gambling," he said, adding that the races would be financed by the Guangzhou track, a main venue for betting races. Other such tracks are in the capital Beijing and on an island off eastern Shandong province.
GCAT	President Boris Yeltsin promised on Saturday to visit Ukraine in early June at the latest to end speculations about a growing rift between the two Slav neighbours, Interfax news agency said. Interfax quoted Yeltsin as telling Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma he would visit Ukraine irrespective of whether the political treaty which the two ex-Soviet republics want to sign is ready or not. Moscow and Kiev are at loggerheads over division of the former Soviet Black Sea fleet and differ on where the Russian share of warships should be based. Kiev has been alarmed by demands by some leading Russian politicians that Sevastopol, the current home base of the fleet in the Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, be designated for sole Russian use. Russia and Ukraine are also split on some economic and trade issues. Moscow and Kiev have so far failed to agree on the terms of a friendship treaty which would sort out major problems existing between them. Yeltsin has postponed his visit to Ukraine at least six times in the past two years. "I will visit Ukraine no matter whether the treaty is ready or not by then," Yeltsin told Kuchma. Some Russian political analysts have suggested that a protracted row between Moscow and Kiev and mutual suspicion between them could prompt Ukraine, which has so far stuck to a political nutrality, to seek closer links with NATO. Moscow, which protests against the western alliance's plans to grant membership to some Central and Eastern European countries, has been openly worried by a series of recent visits to Kiev by top NATO officials. "It's time to put an end (to Russian-Ukraine disputes) because the whole world is speculating about our relations," Yeltsin said. "Russia and Ukraine have good relations. You and I have good relations as well," he told Kuchma. Ukraine's pro-Russian Crimean peninsula was switching to Kiev time this weekend after three years of sticking to Moscow time, in a sign of easing tensions over the region. Ukraine's autonomous region of Crimea, two-thirds of its 2.7 million population Russians, introduced Moscow time three years ago as a token of its opposition to Kiev rule. But Ukraine has managed to reduce the influence of pro-Russian forces in the Crimea in the past two years. Last month the local parliament named a pro-Ukrainian politician as the region's new leader
CCAT	Poland's biggest Plock refinery on Friday raised the prices of its petrol and diesel fuel by five to eight percent at its filling stations and by 5.8 to 11.3 percent in wholesale, the refinery said in a statement. The rise follows the finance ministry's Thursday decision to free all fuel prices and remove administrative limits on distributors' margins. Plock said wholesale prices of the leaded 94 octane and 98 octane petrol would rise 5.8 and 6.3 percent respectively to 1,553 and 1,662 zlotys per tonne while the price of unleaded 95 octane petrol would rise seven percent to 1,485 zlotys. It said wholesale diesel fuel prices would rise by 10 percent and 11.3 percent to 1,181 zlotys and 1,201 zlotys per tonne respectively for the EDP type and EDZ type respectively. In retail, the size of the rises is smaller at five and six percent for the 94 and 98 octane leaded petrol, which now cost 1.59 and 1.71 zlotys per litre respectively and six percent for the 95 octane unleaded, now at 1.55 zlotys. It rose by eight percent for the EDZ diesel to 1.41 zlotys per litre. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700
CCAT	With free market aviation efforts moving ahead in Europe and Asia, U.S. negotiators are now turning their attention to Central and South America, a senior Transportation Department official said on Tuesday. Patrick Murphy, deputy assistant secretary for aviation and international affairs, said five Central American nations have already agreed to hold "open skies" talks. Dates are being arranged for March and April with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama, he said. Murphy added in an interview that negotiations with Chile to remove restrictions on U.S.-Chilean passenger and cargo services have been set for late April. The U.S. effort has turned to Latin America following successes in Europe and more recently in Asia, Murphy said, and are in keeping with the long-range American goal of breaking down aviation services restrictions worldwide. On Feb. 21, the United States reported progress in its two-year-old effort to reach an "open skies" accord with Britain, to add to the free market agreements the United States already has with Germany and 11 other European nations. The United States reached an "open skies" agreement with Singapore on Jan. 22 and is soon to hold talks with Malaysia and Taiwan. Another round of meetings with Japan is scheduled for next week in Washington, and negotiations with Malaysia are underway, Murphy said. He acknowledged that the five Central American nations were not large, but "Central America is not insignificant," noting that Costa Rica is America's 15th-largest air cargo market in the world. "We view them coming together as a group as a serious market," he said. Murphy noted also that while most of the 12 European countries that have reached "open skies" agreements with the United States were small, as a whole, almost all of Europe is now covered by free market accords. He said the "open skies" agreements being planned for Central and South American nations would allow airlines from the United States and those from the agreeing country to fly any route they wish and as frequently as they wish. In addition, he said, the free market accords grant airlines so-called "beyond rights -- permission to pick up passengers and cargo in the other country and carry them to a third country. Murphy said the cargo hub section that was part of the recent U.S.-Singapore accord was not part of standard "open skies" agreements and would not be sought in the pacts with Central and South American nations. This section gives an airline the right to operate a stand-alone cargo hub in the country, in effect making it a centre from which it could ferry freight to any place in the world. The major American carriers serving Central and South America are American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp..
MCAT	South African industrials and all-shares on Monday thwarted market expectations of a retracement in late afternoon trade and climbed to close strong on mostly futures-driven trade, dealers said. Industrials generally shrugged off Wall Street's weaker close last Friday and, while the U.S. market would naturally have some effect on the local market, it was far outweighed by other factors, dealers said. Dealers said morning weakness was probably a follow-through from a bit of profit-taking at month-end last week. Trade this week was seen as being a tussle between the bulls and the bears and in many cases could finish only slightly firmer or weaker with a lack of economic indicators this week -- until Friday -- offering little other direction. Dealers said overall trade on Monday had been sluggish with most volumes traded in the all-shares. Gold shares dipped to the finish despite the bullion price looking healthy around the $362 an ounce level. The industrial index added 16.7 points to 8,261.0 points, all-shares rose 8.6 to 7,153.8 and golds were off 2.9 points to 1,562.9 points.
GCAT	Ex-Formula One drivers Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson, along with Danish co-driver Tom Kristensen, held a narrow lead after the first hour of the Le Mans 24 Hours race on Saturday. Less than 40 seconds separated the leading ten cars but Albereto, driving the Porsche-Joest prototype which started in pole position, recorded the fastest lap with a time of three minutes 48.386 seconds at an average speed of 214 kph. Alboreto, who broke the 13.6-km course record in qualifying on Friday, was being trailed by the Nissan R390 of Belgian Eric van de Poele, supported by another Italian former F1 driver in Riccardo Patrese and Aguri Suzuki of Japan. The factory Porsche 911, second on the grid and driven by Frenchman Bob Wollek with Le Mans veterans Hans Stuck of Germany and Thierry Boutsen of Belgium, was slightly less than half a minute behind in ninth place. But another works Porsche driven by former winner Yannick Dalmas of France -- with compatriot Emmanuel Collard and German Ralf Kellners -- was third, followed by the McLaren of 1995 winner JJ Lehto of Finland, Brazil's ex-F1 champion Nelson Piquet and Briton Steve Soper. Two of the 48 entries pulled out with mechanical problems in the first hour of the race which began (at 1400 GMT) under menacing skies. The weather forecast was for heavy showers during the night and fog in the early morning.
GCAT	A U.S. State department report on global human rights criticised certain areas of Irish life, citing problems in state prison facilities, the level of abuse of children and violence against women, Irish media reported on Friday. The report for 1996, which looks at human rights conditions around the world, said the physical infrastructure of the Irish prison system was barely adequate and that overcrowding and sub-standard facilities caused human rights problems. It said human rights observers were also sceptical about a government plan to expand Dublin's Mountjoy prison. The report said there were human rights problems in other areas such as Ireland's special detention powers, instances of abuse by police and police officials, abuse of children and discrimination and violence against women. The report said "travelers" remain the single most discriminated ethnic group in Ireland. -- Dublin Newsroom +353 1 676 9775

CCAT	Philippine Airlines Inc expects losses of "more or less" two billion pesos in the current fiscal year ending March 31, 1997, Jaime Bautista, the company's chief fianncial officer, said on Tuesday. The airline posted a loss of 2.18 billion pesos in the 1995/96 year.   The airline had earlier projected a lower loss for the current fiscal year at 1.0 billion to 1.3 billion pesos. "Because of the strike we did not meet out target," Bautista told reporters after a shareholders meeting. "The strikes cost us 500 million pesos." The airline had been besieged with a series of strikes prior to last year's November summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation due to wage issues. It later was able to forge three separate collective bargaining agreements with three labour unions. After three straight years of losses, Bautista said the airline is seen returning to profitability in 1998 as the stepped-up delivery of new aircraft improves operations. Philippine Airlines has embarked on a $4.0 billion re-fleeting and modernisation programme involving 36 new aircraft. --Manila newsroom (631) 841-8937

GCAT	Prisoners in a Brazilian jail are holding one prison guard hostage and have killed three detainees after a failed jailbreak attempt, a prison official said on Sunday. A group of prisoners tried unsuccessfully to escape on Sunday, sparking a rebellion involving all 500 detainees at the jail in Praia Grande, a coastal city 50 miles (80 kms) south of Sao Paulo. "For the time being we think at least three prisoners have been killed but we don't know for sure as the rebellion is not over yet," the official said. The prisoners, armed with knives, were demanding the transfer of 15 detainees to another jail, he added. "We are negotiating with them. Yesterday they didn't want to go because it was night. Today they don't want to go because it is Sunday," the official said. The three detainees who were killed were part of a group of around 50 prisoners kept in a maximum security area, he added. The rebellion followed another thwarted jailbreak attempt a few days ago in Sao Paulo when four prisoners and a guard were killed when five detainees tried to escape from Carandiru, Latin America's largest prison, using a garbage truck.
ECAT	Greek M3 money supply growth decelerated to 8.3 percent year-on-year in July from 9.0 percent in June to stay within the central bank's 6.0-9.0 percent target range, the Bank of Greece said in a statement.   The slowdown in M3 money supply growth was linked to the deceleration of total credit expansion which was within the central bank's 5.0-7.0 percent target range, it said.

GCAT	Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic is expected on Saturday to acknowledge opposition victories in local elections and call for a coalition government, a senior political source said. "Milosevic will endorse a report by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in entirety. The statement is being written as we speak," the source told Reuters. There was no official confirmation of the statement or when it would be released, but sources expected it to be on Saturday before a meeting of the major powers' Contact Group on former Yugoslavia in Brussels. An OSCE mission led by former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez last month endorsed all claims by the the opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition. Zajedno claimed it won in 14 of Serbia's 18 largest cities including the capital Belgrade, but Milosevic's Socialists annulled the victories, claiming unspecified irregularities. Cancellation of the November 17 election results triggered a wave of street protests, now in their eighth consecutive week, which have shaked the foundations of 52 years of leftist rule in Serbia. The OSCE has given Belgrade authorities until January 16 to act on the recommendations of its mission. The decision to uphold the OSCE report and call for a coalition government was made at a meeting on Friday of senior officials from the Socialist Party and the Yugoslav United Left, headed by Milosevic's wife Mirjana Markovic, the political source said. A call will be issued for "all left and democratic forces in the country to unite and form a coalition government for the sake of (protecting) the national interest," the source said. Gonzalez' report did not mention the biggest prize Zajedno claims to have won -- the Belgrade city assembly. But if push comes to shove that will be conceded as well over the week, the source said. Conceding election victory would placate the West before it might move to impose sanctions on Yugoslavia. The Contact Group of five major powers was meeting in Brussels later in the day to step up pressure on Milosevic. "I have the impression that they are going to try to get a unified position," said a NATO source. "They will probably come out with a fairly strong statement." The United States has led the unanimous Western condemnation of Milosevic's abuse of democracy in Serbia, cutting Belgrade off from desperately-needed foreign capital. The European Union has called on Milosevic to accept opposition victories and embrace democracy and human rights. Its Council of Ministers of the European Union is expected to address the Serbian crisis at a meeting on January 20-21. Milosevic expects that conceding victory to Zajedno would end the highly embarrassing demonstrations and reduce the risk of civil war that some authoritarian hardliners pray for, another senior political source said. Serbian opposition leaders promised round-the-clock traffic jams in central Belgrade on Saturday, the 55th straight day of peaceful protests against poll fraud. "Take you cars, take your whistles and trumpets, use you car horns, make a din to be remembered and do it non-stop on Saturday," Zajedno leader Vuk Draskovic told his followers Ear-splitting gridlock is the latest in a series of imaginative ploys by Zajedno. "Take your cameras and take pictures together with the police. Record the historical moments for posterity," Draskovic told Belgraders who have been squaring off daily with hundreds of riot police. Milosevic, facing the biggest challenge to his 10-year rule, has been abandoned by part of the army, the Orthodox Church and on Friday even by his normally staunch allies at the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences. Milosevic has conceded his party's election loss in Serbia's second largest city Nis but failed to appease the West or Zajedno leaders, who vowed to continue protests until all their claims were met.
CCAT	Guinness Plc and Grand Metropolitan Plc Monday announced plans for the biggest merger ever in Britain, a $15.8 billion deal that would create the world's seventh largest food and spirits company. Grand Met, owner of Burger King and Pillsbury foods in the United States, also owns Smirnoff vodka and J&B whisky, while Guinness' brands include its well known stout, Johnnie Walker whisky and Gordon's gin. Among Grand Met's other products are Green Giant vegetables and Haagen-Dazs ice cream. The merger will create "a combined spirits and wine company which will truly be a world leader," Grand Met Chairman George Bull said at a news conference. Industry analysts said the two companies fit together well in terms of products and geography, and that the strength of the combined company could prompt other mergers among big food and liquor producers. "It makes total sense, there is virtually nothing that does not fit," said Dermot Carr, analyst at Nikko Europe. The merged company would have annual sales of about $22 billion, pretax earnings of $2.2 billion and a market value of $37 billion based on the stock prices Monday. The stocks of both companies rose as investors cheered the announcement. Under the proposed stock swap, Grand Met shareholders would end up with 52.7 percent of the new company, GMG Brands, with Guinness shareholders getting the rest. In addition to stock in the new company, shareholders will receive a total of $3.9 billion in cash. GMG Brands' four divisions would be United Distillers and Vintners, combining the liquor and wine operations, Pillsbury, Burger King and Guinness Brewing Worldwide. GMG Chief Executive-elect John McGrath said about 2,000 jobs would be cut, out of 20,000 in the companies' liquor business. The two firms employ about 85,000 people worldwide. The companies said they expect savings of $285 million a year in coming years from integrating sales forces, pruning corporate functions and other moves. Bull of Grand Met and Guinness Chairman Tony Greener have been friends and rivals for years, which led to the idea for the merger. "The discussions started because I invited Tony to dinner," Bull said in an interview. After Greener returned from a trip to Africa, the two met and the broad outlines of a deal were set within weeks. Bull said he did not expect the merger to face regulatory problems as the combined company would have 10 percent or less of world spirits markets. "We are entirely confident that we will be able to obtain the agreement of the regulatory authorities both here in Europe and also in the United States and elsewhere," he said. Some competitors complained the proposed merger was anti-competitive and said regulators would probably call for asset sales before approving the transaction. "The deal, in our view, poses serious antitrust problems in the U.S. and Europe and possibly elsewhere," said Robert Matschullat, vice chairman of Seagram Co. Ltd., which makes Chivas Regal, Seagram and other brands. Matschullat said Seagram has not determined if it will formally seek to block the proposed transaction. "I don't know if they think the regulators are asleep at the switch here, but we don't," he said. Analysts said Seagram and other competitors such as Britain's Allied Domecq Plc may be forced to seek merger partners of their own to compete. "All the others will be worried sick, but what are they to do," said analyst Ron Littleboy at Nomura Securities. "This group is now just so powerful and there is unlikely to be a deal open to others which offers the same scale of benefits." Other competitors would include Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsico Inc., Philip Morris Cos. Inc., and McDonalds Inc., the biggest restaurant chain in the United States ahead of Grand Met's Burger King, which is based in Miami. Bull will co-chair the new company with Greener but will retire as planned in July 1998, leaving Greener as chairman. Grand Met's McGrath will be chief executive, with the rest of the board made up of directors from both companies. The merger also means the Guinness name will disappear as a corporate identity after 238 years. Formed in Dublin in 1759, the brewer changed its name from Arthur Guinness & Sons to Guinness Plc in 1985. Grand Met also said pretax profit rose 3.5 percent to 471 million pounds ($764 million), excluding special charges, in the first half of its fiscal year.

ECAT	Ministers, bureaucrats and lobby groups, with hundreds of journalists in their wake, streamed into Singapore at the weekend for the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial conference starting on Monday. Awaiting the visitors were 6,000 local staff including tour guides, chauffeurs and chefs, as Singapore's authorities endeavour to ensure the prestigious event goes off without a hitch. The straight-laced island state has even relaxed its ban on smoking inside buildings -- but only in the corridors of the huge new SUNTEC conference centre where the 128 WTO members hold their week-long meeting. The Singapore government has set aside a budget of S$18 million (US$12.8 million) for lavish receptions, complimentary buffet lunches, and passes for free phone calls and transport. The meeting, the first ministerial conference of the Geneva-based WTO since its launch two years ago to replace the 47-year-old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), has drawn senior trade officials from all over the world. Top officials attending the talks include Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and the European Union's trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan. The British delegation will be headed by Ian Lang, president of the Board of Trade, and Australia's by Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer. Other representives include Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan and Malaysia's minister of international trade and industry, Rafidah Aziz. China's assistant minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation and the chief negotiator for China's entry into the WTO, Long Yongtu, will attend as an observer. New Zealand's caretaker foreign minister Don McKinnon withdrew from the conference on Saturday as two months of coalition talks at home neared their climax. Another face missing from the rostrum will be that of International Labour Organisation (ILO) director general Michel Hansenne, whose invitation was withdrawn due to pressure from developing nations opposed to linking trade with labour issues. Among the cast of non-governmental organisations at the meeting are ActionAid and Christian Aid, the Humane Society of the United States and the World Wildlife Fund. Also present are trade groups from Britain, Norway, India, Australia, Canada, Mexico and South Korea. International stars will be on hand to entertain the ministers and delegates when the conference ends. They include Lea Salonga, star of the musical "Miss Saigon" when it opened in London, singer Shirley Bassey, Sarah Brightman, former wife of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and star of his musical "Phantom of the Opera", and Hindi-language pop star Sharon Prabhakawill.
ECAT	The Slovak Statistical Bureau (SUSR) on Tuesday said consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in August to put prices 5.6 percent higher year-on-year, versus 5.5 percent in July. Analysts welcomed the result, slightly higher than July's monthly rise of 0.3 percent and easily the lowest in eastern Europe, put there was some scepticism. "The figure is perfect and realistic, but the question is how realistic is the base from which it is calculated," said Vladimir Kuklis, an analyst with CSOB Bank. Some analysts had predicted a sharper increase in inflation due to growing pressures from an expanding money supply and partial liberalisation of government price controls. Others said they distrusted the official figures and called for a revision of the basket on which the consumer price index is calculated. They pointed to such price-controlled items in the basket as public housing rents, fuels or transportation, which, they said, were too heavily weighted in the index. "Inflation seems to have reached it's floor at 5.5 percent taking into account recent energy price hikes, but we should witness the effect on inflation of money supply growth by the middle of next year at the latest," said Martin Barto, an analyst with ING Barings. The government raised retail and wholesale energy prices by 10 and five percent respectively from July, and set the maximum price of motor fuels up by about five percent. SUSR officials declined to comment on the issue of revising the CPI basket, but had said earlier a complex index revision was "being considered" some time next year. Neither the controlled price hikes nor the growing money supply have prompted the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) to revise its target for 1996 inflation within the range of 6.0-7.2 percent, which it has said was still realistic. Slovakia's key money supply measure, M2, rose 21.0 percent year-on-year in July, compared to a full 1996 target of an expansion of 11.6 percent. Analysts estimate the impact of M2 could show delays in Slovakia of between nine months to one year. -- Bratislava Newsroom, 42-7-210-3687

GCAT	American Steve Fossett was over the Sahara Desert on Friday, his expedition said, still drifting toward Libya and a possible end to his attempt to become the first to circle the globe nonstop in a balloon. At 7:30 a.m. EST (1230 GMT) his flight headquarters in Chicago said the 52-year-old commodities broker aboard the "Solo Spirit" was over north central Algeria high above the Sahara. His speed was down to 58 knots, considerably slower than the pace which sped him across the Atlantic in three days following his lift-off late on Monday night from St. Louis. Everything was going well with the flight, a spokesman said, except his route which continued to take him toward Libya, whose government has not yet granted permission to enter its airspace. The expedition has attempted to apply international pressure on Libya to say something one way or the other about using its airspace but so far there has been no word and Fossett may have to land rather than take a chance. He had hoped to skirt Libya by catching different winds at varying altitudes -- the only kind of control he has over the craft. But that apparently has not worked so far and the silver balloon was still headed for Libya, whose fractious relations with the United States have left the two countries without formal diplomatic ties. A chase plane sent out by the expedition had found Fossett and was keeping watch on him, a spokesman said. It was not known how soon he would reach the Libyan border but his trackers had estimated it might occur on Saturday. The dangers of entering foreign airspace were illustrated by two American balloonists who died in 1995. They were shot down by Belarus military who claimed they had no clearance to enter its air space. Organisers said they had been cleared. Fossett already holds the record for the longest solo manned balloon flight -- 5,435.8 miles (8,747 km) on a voyage from South Korea to Canada -- a mark that he would better on this voyage at some point over southeast Algeria, the expedition said. British tycoon Richard Branson and Swiss pilot Jean Piccard, who tried and failed in separate missions this month to capture the record Fossett is seeking, had said they would fly Branson's Citation, a small corporate jet, to circle the balloon as a welcome sometime after he passed Gibraltar but the expedtion said on Friday it did not know if that had happened. Branson was one of those who had been trying to intercede with the Libyan government to win Fossett permission to fly over the country. The expedition's Internet site carried an appeal for letters to President Bill Clinton to try to resolve the problem. Fossett's Internet site is http://www.luc.edu/solo. His pursuit of one of manned flight's oldest goals was forced to take a more southerly path than originally planned after he could not win permission from Russia to cross that country on a northern trans-European route. Language barriers in dealing with air traffic control and a number of other problems were involved. If the Libyan question is resolved Fossett hoped to cross Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, Mongolia, China again, perhaps Korea and then head out across the Pacific in a voyage that coule take as long as 18 days. He is riding in an unpressurized, oblong yellow capsule 6-1/2 by four foot (two by 1.3 metres) that is 5-1/2 feet (1.7 metres) high. He has been eating packaged prepared meals and has a small stove to prepare coffee. He has already gone much farther than the two rival expeditions which tried for the record in recent days. Piccard and Wim Verstraeten wound up in the Mediterranean on Sunday six hours after taking off from the Swiss Alps in pursuit of the record. Branson and two crew members brought their Virgin Global Challenger balloon down in Algeria last week less than a day after taking off from Morocco.

GCAT	Standing near Sweden's Royal Palace on a cold wintry night, Franco cast his heavy baited line into the freezing waters that run through the centre of Stockholm. "I've caught around 500 salmon in Stockholm over the past 20 years," says Franco, an Italian who moved to Sweden more than 30 years ago. "Here's my most recent catch," he said, proudly displaying the one that didn't get away -- a four kg (8.82 lb) beauty. Shortly afterwards, another angler caught a 35 cm (13.7 inch) sea trout which he promptly released. "It's rather small," says Franco. "Most fishermen release salmon or sea trout that are less than 50 cm (19.7 inches)." Every night throughout the year, anglers line the banks of the "stream" running through Stockholm's picturesque Old Town, in reality a body of fresh water called the Strommen which separates the Malaren lake on one side of the city from the Baltic Sea on the other side. For most Europeans, it is hard to imagine schools of Atlantic salmon and sea trout swimming through the heart of a European capital. Marine biologists say that salmon and trout require almost pristine conditions to survive. Their presence in Stockholm -- in encouraging numbers -- is a clear sign that the city's water is clean and the aquatic habitats beneath the surface healthy. "It is a point of pride for Stockholmers that their water is clean enough for Atlantic salmon," says Lennart Nyman, a conservation officer with the Swedish branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature. "It shows that the quality of the water is very good." POLLUTION EFFORTS INTRODUCED IN THE 50s An effort to clean the city's waters was launched in the 1950s when industrial and sewage controls were introduced to cut polllution levels. Residents and tourists alike are allowed to fish free of charge and without permits in Stockholm, making it about the only free activity in this Nordic capital where even "happy hour" prices in bars can quickly empty a wallet. Feeless fishing is part of a tradition that goes back to 1436, when the City Council granted wealthy burghers the right to fish the Crown waters in and around the city. These rights were given royal sanction in 1636 by Queen Christina and successive monarchs. In 1860, the privilege of angling in Crown waters was extended to all of Stockholm's inhabitants, including visitors. Salmon and sea trout, however, were not caught in the city's waters until the 1970s. "Salmon are not native to the Stockholm Strommen," says Nyman. "There is no place for them to spawn and the system is filled with predators." Salmon and sea trout were first introduced in Strommen in 1973, when 500 hatchery-reared two-year-old smolt were released by the city's sports federation. Two years later, the experiment proved a success when some returned from the Baltic Sea. Since then, around 600,000 salmon and sea trout smolt have been released under a programme sponsored by the City Council, the National Board of Fisheries and the State Power Board (Vattenfall). "We release about 25,000 salmon and sea trout smolt each year, and estimate that around 25 percent return," says Kjell Winstrom, a fisheries biologist at Vattenfall. "About 800 sea trout and over 100 salmon were taken in 1996. "They usually come back in two to three years' time and grow quite quickly. They weigh around 100 grammes when they are released and average five kg to 10 kg (11-22 lb) when they come back." FISH of RECORD SIZE Some grow to be enormous. The record salmon taken from Stockholm's waters, just south of the parliament, weighed in at 19.4 kg (42.77 lb). Trophies of that size are tempting bait which lure anglers to the city's Old Town on long, freezing Nordic nights. The salmon introduction scheme in Stockholm is part of a larger national programme which has seen almost two million smolt released in more than 30 Swedish rivers. Around 90 percent of Sweden's salmon population has been domestically reared. But the programme has not been a complete success. "The domestically-hatched salmon all over Sweden have been plagued by M-74 disease, a vitamin deficiency passed by mothers to their young. Newly-hatched smolt with the disease don't begin feeding and die," says Dr Lars Karlssonm, a fisheries biologist with the Swedish Salmon Research Institute. "We have been unable to detect the source of the disease in the food chain." Karlsson said the country's off-shore commercial salmon catch fell in 1995 to 2,892 tonnes from 5,600 tonnes in 1990. Still, the fishing in Stockholm is better than that found in any other European capital. Franco, for one, is hooked. "I come here most nights," he said as he cast his line into the water once more.

GCAT	Brazilian mayoral elections strengthened an opponent of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's bid for re-election in 1998, but did not seriously hurt the president, analysts said on Saturday. Cardoso was barely affected by Friday's municipal second-round nationwide vote, although candidates of his PSDB party in the major cities of Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte took drubbings, analysts said. "As in the first round on Oct. 3, these elections had a local, not a national character," said Bolivar Lamounier of the Sao Paulo Institute of Economic, Social and Political Studies. But the election of Celso Pitta as mayor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, is seen as boosting his mentor, incumbent mayor and presidential hopeful Paulo Maluf, in his bid to block Cardoso's re-election efforts in Congress. Pitta, of Maluf's right-wing PPB party, easily defeated former mayor Luiza Erundina by 57.4 percent of the vote to 34.7 percent, according to official results. As a result, "Maluf's presidential aspirations and his opposition to Cardoso's re-election will gain force," Lamounier said. Pitta, a political neophyte personally picked and groomed by Maluf to be his successor, ran a campaign promising simply to continue the incumbent's work. His easy victory gave Maluf added clout to oppose Cardoso's re-election bill and ensured him a solid base for a national campaign, analysts said. The president's efforts to amend the constitution to allow him to become Brazil's first re-elected president will take center stage next week now mayoral campaigns are over. "The only major obstacle is Maluf," one analyst said, but added the government had already gained ground on the issue by installing a special commission in Congress' lower house and had so far avoided serious challenges while winning support. Therefore, analysts said, the impact of the mayor's race was seen as limited. "I'm not saying re-election will be easy, but these (runoff) elections are not going to weigh much," Lamounier said. The president wisely stood back from runoff campaigning, including Sao Paulo where Pitta's easy victory was expected, and campaigns centered on local issues of transport, health care and crime, he added. Cardoso "is in a comfortable position because he did in the second round what he should have done in the first," wrote columnist Dora Kramer in Jornal do Brasil. "He stayed far away from the campaign and thus avoided unnecessary wastage."

ECAT	China has taken a bold move to reduce political influence in setting money supply by creating a special policy body modelled after the U.S. Federal Reserve, analysts said on Monday. The new group, which held its first meeting last week, is only an advisory body but it is headed by the central bank chief and is vaguely patterned after the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which determines U.S. interest rate levels. "This is a very positive step," said Chen Xingdong, chief economist (China) at Peregrine Brokerage Ltd in Beijing. "This will make the setting of monetary policy more stable." Monetary policy in China is highly politicised and is ultimately determined by the State Council (cabinet) with competing factions and regional interests exerting political leverage, often obstructing the views of the central bank, or People's Bank of China. The banking system has been the lifeblood of many money-losing state enterprises, which wield considerable clout due to their role as major employers and vital components in maintaining social order. They have traditionally pushed for policy loans to keep them afloat and easier monetary policies to reduce their heavy debt burden. In the past, the central bank made its own policy recommendations but competing interests would plead their case with the State Council. "That's where the disputes would be," said Chen. With the new body, known as the monetary policy committee of the People's Bank of China, monetary policy would be debated at a technical level and then a recommendation would be drafted for the State Council to review. "This body will be much like the Federal Open Market Committee," said an official at the China Everbright Bank, who declined to be identified by name. "This will mean the nation's monetary policy will be determined more on the basis of supply and demand for credit," he said. The body, which will hold quarterly meetings, will be headed by central bank governor Dai Xianglong and vice governor Chen Yuan will act as deputy. Its members include deputy director of the State Planning Commission Wang Chunzheng as well as senior officials of the State Economic and Trade Commission, the finance ministry, the securities watchdog the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the foreign exchange regulatory body, the heads of two of the nation's top commercial banks and a renowned academic. At its first meeting, the policy committee agreed to continue the central bank's "appropriately tight" monetary policies, the official China Daily said on Saturday. "This is an advisory body," said Wu Xiaoqiu, director of the department of finance and securities at People's University, an academic institute in Beijing. "But it will ensure medium and long term interests are considered in the setting of monetary policy."
ECAT	The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has cut its rediscount rate to 23.5 percent from 27 percent with effect from Friday, the state-owned Herald newspaper reported on Saturday. The paper quoted the bank as saying the move was expected to boost economic activity. "The bank said in a statement that the reduction, which comes on the back of declines in inflation rates, is expected to see banks lower their lending rates and provide the much needed relief to the productive sectors," the Herald said. "This would underpin the strong growth the economy is currently experiencing," it added. Zimbabwe's annual inflation rose to 16.4 percent in December from a seven-year low of 13.9 percent in November. Although a recent spate of price increases are expected to increase January's inflation figure, many analysts still expect annual inflation to stay in a 16-18 percent range in the first quarter of 1997. Last year, the Reserve Bank cut the rediscount rate first by two percent to 27.5 percent and then by 0.5 percent to 27 percent in October 1996. -- Harare newsroom +263-4 72 52 28/9
CCAT	Shipping-based Osprey Maritime Ltd shares rose 6.48 percent, or 14 cents, to Singapore $2.30 on Wednesday after it announced a US$750 million takeover of Monaco-based oil and gas carrier Gataas-Larsen Shipping Corp. The shares hit a high of S$2.40 before easing to S$2.30, up 14 cents from its previous close. Volume was a moderate 178,000 units. An analyst with a European brokerage said the volume was moderate because the company's shares are fairly illiquid. "The deal looks fair. It seems Osprey paid a fair price for the vessels that it will be getting," she said.   In the takeover, Osprey will acquire four liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers, four very large crude carriers and a half share of a LNG carrier. Analysts said the main shareholders were backing the project with Gataas-Larsen taking a stake in Osprey. The group's bankers also seemed supportive judging by the response to the syndicated loan facility for the takeover, they said. "There could be more upside to the share of perhaps 10-20 percent even after the rights issue," an analyst said.   Osprey has proposed to take on new net debt of US$493 million and to issue new equity of US$257 million through a one-for-one rights issue as well as a redeemable cumulative convertible preference share. - Singapore Newsroom 65-8703080
ECAT	Venezuelan consumer prices rose 1.6 percent in March, compared with a 6.2 percent rise in March 1996 and a 2.3 percent increase in February this year, the central bank said on Tuesday. It was the fifth consecutive drop in the monthly inflation rate, which has slowed from a peak of 15.6 percent in May. Cumulative inflation in the 12 months to the end of March 1997 was 74.8 percent, compared to 78.1 percent in the 12 months to March 1996, the central bank said.
CCAT	Italy's Banca Popolare di Milano said it is to cut its prime rate by 75 basis points to 8.75 percent effective from February 3.   The bank's director-general Giuseppe Grassano told a news conference that the bank's top rate would fall also by 75 basis points down to 16.0 percent. The top rate is the ceiling rate at which the banks make loans. Banca Popolare di Milano is the third Italian bank to cut its interest rates following moves by the Banca Sella and Banca Popolare di Novara which last week both cut their primes rates to 8.75 percent from 9.50 percent. This followed a move by the Bank of Italy to reduce its discount rate to 6.75 percent from 7.50 percent and its fixed advances or Lombard rate to 8.25 percent from nine percent on January 21. -- Milan newsroom +392 66129502
CCAT	JP Morgan has initiated its coverage of Indonesia's largest cement maker PT Semen Gresik with a "market performer" rating. Morgan said Gresik was fairly valued at current levels, trading at a 13 percent premium to the market in 1996 and a three percent discount in 1997. "The stock has historically traded at an average nine percent discount to the market but we believe it should trade at par, given its solid fundamentals and the expected improving market conditions next year," Tissa Lee of Morgan said. "We therefore initiate coverage of Gresik with a market performer rating and a 12-month target price of 7,780 rupiah," Lee said. Morgan said Gresik had transformed itself into a leading national cement supplier through the acquisition of two cement plants last year, doubling its capacity to 8.5 million tonnes. It said Gresik was now Indonesia's largest cement maker with a capacity of 11.1 million tonnes, surpassing its biggest rival PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa for the first time, after the completion of Tonasa IV this year. "The stock is the most liquid in the sector and its free float was further enlarged following the conversion of rights by the Indonesian government," Lee said.  -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
CCAT	Photocopier giant Xerox Corp., a longtime leader in corporate copiers, Monday unveiled its first product for the home, a $499 combination color printer, copier and scanner for personal computers. Dubbed the Document HomeCentre, the device is aimed at small and home offices, Xerox said. The company also introduced the Document WorkCentre 450c, a device that combines color printing with faxing, copying and scanning and has a retail price of $549. With its new products, the Stamford, Conn.-based company -- long synonymous with photocopying equipment for the large corporate market -- is entering a market now dominated by companies like Hewlett-Packard Co. and Japan's Canon Inc. "We are extremely confident of success," Rosemary Thomas, vice president and general manager of Xerox Channels Group's North American retail operations, said in an interview. "I would just cite what we've done in the personal copier market in the last six years, (in which Xerox) has gone from player number three or four, to number one," Thomas said. "I would expect that we're going to be the fastest-growing entity within the corporation, and, hopefully, the fastest-growing within the marketplace," she said. Xerox set up its Channels Group in May to focus on retail and dealer sales, as opposed to the company's traditional, direct sales force. Thomas said the company expects to increase its retail and indirect channel sales to $4 billion from $1 billion over the next three years. Industry analysts said Xerox's pursuit of the home retail market sales was a landmark event. "This is dramatic, (and) this could mark the beginning of a whole new Xerox," said Kristy Holch, analyst at InfoTrends Research Group in Kansas City. "If Xerox wants to continue growing, they've got to be in those (indirect sales) channels." Holch said the key question was whether Xerox would be able to leverage its famous name for the household market. "Here is Xerox, with this very office, corporate brand, trying to bring a product into the home. That brings with it a host of questions. Even if the product is the right one, is Xerox's organization set up to support that market?" The Document HomeCentre is the more revolutionary of the two new products, analysts said. It creates a new industry category, whereas the WorkCentre 450c is basically a new version of the company's old 250, which stopped production last year. "The 450c is more evolutionary, and the HomeCentre is more revolutionary, in that it is the first product specifically designed for the home, personal use market, and not for business," said Andrew Johnson, analyst at Dataquest. He said U.S. sales of personal color multifunction products should grow to 2.6 million units by 2001 from a projected 510,000 units in 1997. Johnson said he was "very optimistic" about the new products' chances of success. "They're not (known for home products), but they have great name recognition, and it's very much transferable." He added, "I don't think it's a matter of Xerox taking away any sales from Hewlett-Packard or Canon. The market is growing so fast that everybody will be very successful." The launch of the HomeCentre appears well timed, Holch said. "Certain things they've done with the product satisfy some of the requirements for the home -- like ease of use, a reasonable price and versatility." The Document HomeCentre will be available at stores in the United States and Canada early next month, Xerox said. It will be available in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year and Latin America in the first quarter of 1998. The Document WorkCentre 450c will be available at U.S. and Canadian retailers later this month, and will be in Europe and Latin America in the fourth quarter of this year. Xerox stock fell $56 cents to $74.19 in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
CCAT	As you work on your business plan, there are numerous issues you should be preparing to discuss with your attorney and accountant before launching your business. As the experienced entrepreneur knows, good advice is priceless, but the cost of bad advice can be endless. With that in mind, search for the best advisers you can find, while simultaneously preparing yourself to elicit their best advice. Where to start? Ask around for recommendations. But keep a critical view. "Usually what happens is, people ask a friend who's a lawyer or accountant. If you don't detest the person and they're not going to bankrupt you, you go with them. That's not necessarily the best way," said Kevin Sheridan, a partner in the New York law firm Roberts, Sheridan & Kotel, which specialises in advising new business owners. He suggests you ask for examples of other new businesses they've assisted and if they can put you in touch with the people involved. "You want someone who's asking insightful questions and listening to the answers," Sheridan said. He recommends finding both an attorney and an accountant who specialise in small businesses. "I often tell people, 'Don't just rely on your lawyer's advice.' A lawyer can't be everything to everyone, and a lawyer's advice is often more expensive than a small-business acccountant's." Sheridan recommends hiring an attorney who doesn't just set up small businesses, but rather one who does other work as well. "A lot of (legal) practices just crank them out. There will be much less ability or sensitivity to the specific needs of the business," he said. While conducting your search for consulting expertise, you will help yourself and likely improve your adviser's performance if you familiarize yourself with the specific issues involved. In addition to the critical choice of the appropriate business entity, be it sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation or any of the numerous variations, there are a host of additional "housekeeping issues" involved in setting up a business. Jay Nathanson, a principal at the law firm Rosenblum, Goldenhersh, Silverstein & Zafft, P.C. in Clayton, Mo., years ago drew up an agenda for establishing a general business corporation. While some items may not apply in other states, it offers a basic checklist approach for both attorney and client. The agenda covers issues ranging from choosing and registering a name; getting business permits and an employer identification number; setting up buy-sell agreements, restrictive stock arrangements and non-competition agreements; determining the method of accounting; terms of employment, fringe benefits and payroll; to the need to conduct business in the corporate name and to keep minutes of shareholder and director meetings. "It's rare that I get somebody that comes in here and knows absolutely nothing and is going into a brand new business for the first time," said Nathanson. "They know about insurance, a CPA, licensing, and the like." But for those who do not, and especially for the more complicated issues, an expert's input is essential. "You want to make sure that if someone leaves, they don't steal all the company secrets and good will," said Nathanson. While you most likely don't want to invest the time and effort needed to earn your own law or accounting degree, you would do well to read up on these issues so you can get the most for your money spent on expert advice. Questions or comments on the Newbiz column can be sent via e-mail to Daniel.Grebler(at)Reuters.Com   The following is an abbreviated version of an agenda for general business incorporation compiled by Jay Nathanson, a principal at the law firm Rosenblum, Goldenhersh, Silverstein & Zafft, P.C. in Clayton, Mo. 1.

ECAT	Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director for the International Monetary Fund, on Friday urged central banks to set specific targets for inflation, saying a rate of 1-3 percent would be an optimal goal for major industrialized nations. "For an industrialized country that has already attained single-digit inflation, it is best to target a rate in the range of 1 to 3 percent," Fischer said in a paper prepared for delivery at a symposium here.   The theme of the symposium, an annual event sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, is "Achieving Price Stability." Pointing to numerous studies showing that inflation, particularly at very high levels, impedes long-run growth, Fischer said the evidence argues for policies that foster  low inflation. Yet he said that for a number of reasons, including measurement problems, he would not advise aiming for zero inflation.   Fischer noted that the key inflation gauges in major industrial nations, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, are believed to overstate true inflation by around 0.5 percentage point a year. In the United States, some experts have estimated the upward bias could be in the range of 1 to 2 percentage points. Thus, he said, targeting zero inflation could end up resulting in actual deflation. Both zero inflation and a deflation situation would pose complications for monetary policy as it could mean that a negative real interest rate might be needed in circumstances such as a recession, he said.   "If the expected inflation rate is zero, then it is very difficult for monetary policy to engineer a negative short-run interest rate," Fischer said. "The serious constraints placed on monetary policy in a zero-inflation or deflationary environment have recently been evident in Japan," he added. An inflation target of around 2 percent or a range of 1 to 3 percent is "in practice" what most central banks mean when they talk of price stability, Fischer said.   Explaining why he felt it was important to set a specific target for inflation, Fischer said it would help central bankers avoid a dilemma in which their rhetoric on inflation does not always match their actions. That situation can arise when central bankers talk of the need to focus on price stability as the sole goal of monetary policy but then undermine the credibility of their statements when the undertake countercyclical policies such as when their economies are in recession, he said. "Once there is an explicit numerical inflation target for monetary policy, and a transparent framework for making policy and holding policymakers accountable for their actions, it is not possible to overlook the potential inflationary consequences of monetary expansion undertaken for short-term countercyclical purposes," Fischer said. While pointing out that the sustained low inflation of industrial nations has had a "remarkable" impact on diminishing peoples' concerns about inflation, he said those nations still have yet to fully achieve price stability. "Periodic alarums in the capital market when the economy expands too fast reveal that we are not yet there," he said.
GCAT	A U.S. district judge has refused to dismiss a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of thousands of Nicaraguan immigrants who claim the United States has illegally denied them residency. U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King, in a ruling issued on Friday but made public on Monday, said his court had jurisdiction over the lawsuit and ordered the government to file an answer to the complaint within 30 days. "It's a big victory. It's without precedent," said Jose Lagos, spokesman for Nicaraguan Fraternity, a party to the lawsuit. "It will allow our lawsuit to go ahead." The lawsuit, filed on March 23, alleged that thousands of Nicaraguans who fled the U.S.-backed Contra war in their homeland during their 1980s had been illegally denied resident status, leaving them in immigration limbo while allowing them to work and pay taxes. It named as defendants President Bill Clinton, Attorney General Janet Reno and Immigration and Naturalisation Service Commissioner Doris Meissner and claimed class-action status on behalf of 50,000 Nicaraguans, most of them living in Miami. The lawsuit represented just one salvo in an ongoing battle between immigrant advocates and the government over amendments to immigration law that took effect April 1. The changes left thousands of refugees from Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador and other countries open to deportation. Lawyers for Nicaraguan immigrant groups say the legal changes had forced hundreds of Nicaraguans underground, moving from house to house to avoid deportation. The suit asked the court to rule that the U.S. government violated the constitutional rights of the refugees and to grant "orderly determination" of their asylum claims. King's ruling came on a motion to dismiss the suit in which the government claimed the court did not have jurisdiction. In a separate lawsuit on similar issues, King in June issued a preliminary injunction which prevented the INS from ordering mass deportations. He set a trial for Jan. 5. In July, Reno announced a package of initiatives to protect immigrants, including a vow to review a ruling by the Immigration Appeals Board that could have resulted in mass expulsions and legislation to Congress to ease restrictions on immigrants.
MCAT	Sugar prices were dragged down on Tuesday by light physical demand and good supplies, dealers said. "Millers were sellers because they faced rising stockpiles and dull outstation demand," one trader said. In the ready delivery sugar S-30 fell 4-10 rupees to 1,340/1,376 per quintal while M-30 slid 6-10 to 1,370/1,432. Sugar mill delivery eased to 1,270/1,285 per quintal from 1,280/1,295. Overall sentiment was subdued at the close and traders expect further losses due to sluggish demand. -Bombay Commodities +91-22-265 9000
GCAT	The opposition Centre Party plans to sumbit next week an interpellation against the left-right-green government, the Centre Party parliamentary group said in a statement on Tuesday. It was not yet clear exactly when the interpellation would be presented in parliament, an official at the legislature said. The government must respond, and an interpellation debate leads by law to a parliamentary vote of confidence in the government. The five coalition parties have a wide majority, 142-seats in the 200-strong house, where the Speaker does not vote. In the statement, the Centre Party said the cabinet's policy was dividing the nation. The government was not even trying to combat unemployment, it was making those worst off even poorer by cutting social benefits and making the rich richer by lowering taxes, it said. If based on the themes raised by the Centre Party, the interpellation debate will highlight the differences of opinion on domestic economic policy priorities between the government parties and the opposition just a month before municipal and European Parliament elections on October 20. --Peter Starck, Helsinki Newsroom  +358 - 0 - 680 50 245
GCAT	Doug Peters, Canada's secretary of state for financial institutions, said on Monday that he would not run in the next federal election. "I want to thank my many supporters...for their confidence in me and for their faith in me as their member of Parliament," Peters said in a statement. Peters gave no reason for his decision. The former senior bank economist was a star candidate in the 1993 election that swept the ruling Liberals to power. But as minister responsible for financial institutions, Peters was criticized for his handling of proposed reforms to Canada's Bank Act.   Peter's so-called White Paper on financial reforms was criticized by foreign bankers for still forcing them to operate federally regulated subsidiaries in Canada. Canada's Senate banking committee later said that Peters' paper did not go far enough and it urged the federal government to boost competition by allowing foreign banks to set up branches. Peters' white paper was also pre-empted by federal Finance Minister Paul Martin in last spring's budget when a bid for more insurance powers by Canada's big banks was rejected. The industry had expected the insurance question to be dealt with in the white paper. A federal election is expected this year. ((Reuters Toronto Bureau (416) 941-8100))

CCAT	South African mining house JCI Ltd posted slightly better results on Wednesday for the six months to end-December period and looked forward to further profit growth for the rest of the year. "JCI has continued to make good progress in its endeavours towards growing its operating assets base during the period," JCI's managing director Bill Nairn told a news conference. "Some sacrifice of short term earnings has been necessary in pursuance of this objective. Nonetheless, despite this and a weaker gold price, the sustainable earnings forecast for the financial year under current market conditions should show an improvement on the 1996 results," he added. JCI's half year attributable profit rose to 253 million rand from 127 million rand last time, while headline earnings per share climbed from 111 cents to 115 cents. JCI's gold earnings showed some light despite a dulled bullion price which continue to dog sales of the precious metal. JCI's coal and base metal division increased profits for the six month period from 54 million rand to 67 million rand, Nairn said, adding market conditions had been stable and the operations had gained positively from higher rand prices for export coal due to a weaker rand. JCI hiked its gold profits from 185 million rand in the previous period to 264 million rand. Nairn said tighter trading conditions and low world ferrochrome prices had stunted performance of its chrome division Consolidated Metallurgical Industries and chrome earnings dropped from 50 million rand to 14 million rand. Nairn said JCI remained committed to its strategic objective of focus and growth with 37 million rand spent over the six month period on exploration and new business developments. He said a further 52 million rand had been invested on new projects outside the country. "The company remains committed to its strategic objective of focus and operational growth. Exploration activities are currently being conducted on 25 projects in seven countries for a variety of commodities,' Nairn added. He said another positive development was the selling of Anglo American Corp of South Africa's 34.9 stake in JCI to the black empowerement consortium African Mining Group (AMG), headed by Mzi Khumalo, for 2.9 billion rand. AMG has until May 2, to raise enough cash to close the deal. "The deal is viewed by all of us at JCI Ltd as an extremely positive one," Nairn said "It is vital that South African employees, mine employees in particular be encouraged to participate actively in the processes and the running of our business and that they are given assistance to take on the responsibility of the newly established democracy which has empowered them. "We believe that the expertise of our new owners will play a major role in facilitating...and focusing further our operations and (will) enhance growth and efficiencies," he added. The AMG deal will give black business a significant stake in the South African mining industry for the first time. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003

GCAT	Pakistan's political parties were allotted symbols on Sunday to help people vote in next February's election -- with the two frontrunners drawing the emblems of an arrow and a tiger. The symbol of an arrow went to ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) while the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) party of her main rival, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, was given the tiger. A total of 49 parties will take part in the February 3 election -- being held after Bhutto's three-year-old government was sacked and the lower house of parliament dissolved last November. But political observers say the election will be a straight fight between the PPP and PML. Symbols to identify political parties easily are vital in Pakistan's elections because only about 30 percent of the population of 130 million can read and write. Most voters, from the isolated valleys of the Hindukush mountains in the north to the bullet-scarred slums of the volatile port city of Karachi in the south, will simply place a mark beside the symbol of their choice. Bhutto, whose government was sacked by President Farooq Leghari on disputed charges of corruption and misrule, has challenged her dismissal before the Supreme Court. The court has promised to give its ruling before the elections. In 1993, the Supreme Court overturned a similar dismissal of Sharif as prime minister by then president Ghulam Ishaq Khan. Formally filing her candidature on Saturday in her home town of Larkana, Bhutto told reporters she was confident she would be similarly returned to power. Sharif filed his candidature in his home city of Lahore, capital of the populous Punjab province. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, has refused to contest the election after being detained following the ouster of his wife's government, in which he was investment minister. Zardari was re-arrested on Thursday in connection with the alleged murder of Bhutto's estranged brother, Murtaza Bhutto, in September after being released from a Karachi jail. Murtaza's Lebanese-born widow, Ghinwa, who heads a breakaway PPP faction of her husband, has filed her candidature in another consituency from Larkana district to fight her mother-in-law, Nusrat Bhutto. The main contest will be for 207 Moslem seats in the 217-seat National Assembly, while Christians and other minorities will dispute 10 seats in separate lists.
MCAT	Grain and oilseed exports reported by USDA and private export sources. WHEAT SALE - Egypt on Sunday bought at least 300,000 tonnes of Australian wheat at prices below $145 per tonne, fob, European grain traders said. The wheat was for shipment in February. On Sunday it also bought 200,000 tonnes of Argentine wheat at prices ranging from $130-132 a tonne FOB.   WHEAT SALE - Two Philippine firms on Monday bought 35,000 tonnes of Canadian wheat for immediate shipment, traders said. Prices at which the firms bought the Canadian wheat were not immediately available, but traders said "they were definitely below the prevailing price of $195 per tonne FOB for U.S. wheat." High prices of U.S. wheat had compelled local flour millers to look for alternative sources. WHEAT TENDER - Algeria has launched a tender to import 150,000 tonnes of French or U.S. or Argentine milling wheat, or any combination of the three, for shipment in January and February, European grain traders said.   WHEAT TENDER - Pakistan issued separate tenders on Monday for 270,000 tonnes of U.S. Grade 2 or better soft white wheat and Australian white milling wheat for delivery between January 8-31. The Pakistani Ministry of Food and Agriculture invited bids to be opened at 1100 Pakistan Standard Time on December 22 and must remain valid until 1800 PST on December 23 for the supply of 270,000 tonnes U.S. soft white wheat in bulk plus/minus five percent buyer's option to be financed under the GSM 102 export program. In a separate tender, it invited bids to be opened at the same date and time for the supply of 270,000 tonnes of Australian white milling wheat.   WHEAT TENDERS (cont.) - Turkey will invite bids Dec 10 to import 200,000 tonnes of red and white milling wheat on a three-year credit basis, a grain official said. He said the imports would be from either the U.S., Australia, Argentina or any EU member country. - Sri Lanka is expected to soon seek 100,000 tonnes of optional origin wheat for delivery in January and February. BARLEY TENDER - Jordan is expected to tender later this month for 50,000 tonnes optional origin barley slated for January shipment, several U.S. exporters said.   MARKET TALK - Iraq's Minister of Trade Mohammed Mehdi Saleh on Sunday said wheat was the main component of two million tonnes of commodities it will buy under a six-month, $2 billion U.N. oil-for-food deal. "Our imports under the memorandum are around two million tonnes, which will ensure the operation of Umm Qasr and Aqaba port," Saleh said the mechanism of the U.N. deal allowing Iraq to sell oil worth $2 billion over six months to pay for food and medicine. Saleh said Iraq would be importing 1.2 million tonnes of wheat, 340,000 tonnes of rice and 300,000 tonnes of sugar over the six-month period.   ... Japanese traders said on Monday they were increasingly interested in the cheaper Brazilian soybean crop as buyers continue ahead of the Christmas holidays to purchase U.S. soybeans for February shipment.

GCAT	Three Arab nationals and a retired Paraguayan military officer were arrested in connection with threats against the U.S. embassy in Asuncion, a Paraguayan police spokesman said on Thursday. "The arrests were made yesterday and today simultaneously in (the border town of) Ciudad del Este and in Asuncion," police spokesman Antonio Noguera told Reuters. "But for the moment they are just being held for questioning." U.S. diplomats said on Tuesday the American embassy was threatened by an international guerrilla group which officials in Washington hinted could be the Iranian-backed Hizbollah. The embassy suspended public celebrations of the U.S. presidential election after receiving what it termed a "terrorist threat." A statement on the threat was also issued by the State Department in Washington. Asked if Hizbollah, which is best known in Lebanon but also reportedly has affiliates in other countries, was behind the threat, a U.S. official said on Tuesday: "I wouldn't steer you away from that." Another official said: "I don't think we're talking about indigenous groups here. We're talking about groups that operate on a global basis." The Moslem fundamentalist Hizbollah has been blamed for past attacks in neighbouring Argentina that destroyed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992, killing 29 people, and a Jewish community centre there in 1994, killing 86. U.S. experts on Latin America have suggested guerrillas might choose Paraguay for an attack because of the relative ease of fleeing the country, particularly from Ciudad del Este, where the borders of Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil meet.
ECAT	German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, struggling to whip Bonn's finances into shape for the single European currency, said on Sunday he expected the 1996 German budget deficit to be above earlier projections. Waigel told Focus magazine the earlier estimate of about 60 billion marks ($40.4 billion) would be surpassed due to higher costs for unemployment and slow economic growth. But he said the deficit would not top 70 billion marks. Waigel's comments followed government sources on Friday saying Bonn would be forced to boost its supplement to the Federal Labour Office by seven billion marks and its payments of unemployment assistance by 5.5 billion marks. Budget experts from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition were also involved in talks at the weekend aimed at cutting 1997 government spending to meet the Maastricht Treaty criteria for Germany to enter currency union in 1999. The talks were expected to approve a plan by Waigel to raise 1997 government borrowings to 56.5 billion marks, up seven billion marks from a medium-term plan drafted in 1995. The 1997 draft budget was approved by the cabinet in July and should have a first reading in parliament this week. The weekend saw political temperatures rise as unions held demonstrations in major cities across the country to protest against the government's planned austerity measures, which they say will hurt jobs. Waigel has vowed to bring Germany's overall public deficit down to 2.5 percent of GDP in 1997, comfortably below the three percent target set out in the treaty. But few economic experts believe Waigel's rosy scenario. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said on Thursday Germany might just make the three percent target in 1997 if it implemented all its planned savings measures. The federal budget deficit, however, accounts for only half Germany's total public deficit. The rest stems from state and local governments, pensions and social security, over which Waigel has less control. Hitting the economic criteria required for monetary union will be difficult since an economic slump has hurt tax revenues, boosted outlay on jobless benefits and lowered the tolerable deficit ceiling, according to experts. Germany and other European nations must meet strict deficit and debt targets if they hope to qualify for EMU in 1997, the key year for deciding the starting participants when the single currency, called the Euro, is launched in 1999.

MCAT	Singapore shares are expected to find firmer footing early Monday supported by an improved outlook for the local economy, dealers said. The economy was expanding faster than expected and would grow at between six and seven percent in 1997, up from a revised five to seven percent, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said on Friday. This was seen putting some spark into the recently lifeless market riddled late last week by fears of possible termination of dual listings in 16 blue chips including the Big Four banks. But dealers cautioned the mood was still bearish as investors might continue to liquidate ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting on August 19 and uncertainties on dual listings. The latter triggered a fall in the foreign tranches and a rise in the local tranches last week. "The possible delisting of foreign tranches have shaken investors' confidence," a broker with a local house said. On Friday, the Straits Times Industrials Index ended 9.32 points down at 1,943.92.

ECAT	The Bundesbank said on Wednesday that although German economic growth had paused in late 1996, this was not a change in trend and conditions for continued growth appeared good. In its February monthly report the German central bank said structural reform was now needed to give the economy a boost. Proposed reforms to the German tax system were a step in the right direction but had to be implemented quickly. The bank rejected suggestions that it could itself take more action to stimulate the economy. A more economy-oriented policy would hurt the central bank's credibility, unsettle markets and leave structural problems unresolved, it said. "The stimulus within the German economy did not continue towards the end of 1996," the Bundesbank said in its economic review of the winter months. "However the calming in economic activity is not to be seen as the same thing as a change in the trend," it added. Noting that the demand and production patterns seen could at first glance appear similar to the economic weakness which took hold in the second half of 1995, the central bank said that this was not the case as general conditions were much improved. "On a closer look it becomes clear that the important economic environment has improved considerably since then," the report said. "This is particularly true for exchange rates, wage agreements and for interest rates, which are now at a historically low level. This gives justification for the expectation of an acceleration in growth in 1997." The central bank welcomed government steps to improve the competitiveness of German companies through tax reform and reform of welfare payment systems and urged Bonn to implement such reforms quickly to help stimulate investment. Noting that investment was the weakest element in the current economic upturn, the Bundesbank said, "The early creation of certainty (on reform) could help considerably to increase the willingness of companies to invest and thus to create new jobs." It added that any such changes would of course take some time to feed through into the labour market. The German central bank noted that the current historical lows in capital market rates had raised the risk of volatility on bond markets, as developments since the end of last year had shown. "In this environment it is important not to allow any doubt to arise as to the firm stability orientation of monetary policy and as to the lasting consolidation of state budgets ... so as not to provide a floor for speculative exaggerations" the centr al bank said. The Bundesbank also noted that a more reactive monetary policy, as had been urged upon it as a means of combating unemployment and weak spending, "could on the other hand easily prove itself counter-productive because it could lead to loss of credibil ity and higher capital market rates." "Quite apart from that, the current economic problems in Germany, which are overwhelmingly structural in origin, can only be solved by economic and political reforms and not with a policy of cheap money," the report concluded.
ECAT	Brazilian Central Bank Director for International Affairs Gustavo Franco said this year's current account deficit could reach $20 billion, but he shrugged off recent concerns about the deficit. He said $18 billion of the current account deficit would be financed, because of the large proportion of Brazil's imports which are financed nowadays and no longer paid for in cash. "Basically this means that the trade balance no longer is such an important indicator of our external relations as it used to be," Franco said. "The trade balance has to be seen in context and not as one little number that represents the entire complexity of our external trade relations." Franco dismissed the possibility of any changes in monetary policy, saying the government was studying a number of measures to boost exports. -- Simona de Logu, Rio de Janeiro newsroom, 5521 507 4151
MCAT	Most CBOT corn futures made fresh contract lows again early Thursday, under pressure from good crop weather in the U.S. Midwest, traders said. Traders said Wednesday's National Weather Service six- to 10-day outlook was bearish for corn futures.

GCAT	A bomb exploded in Nigeria's biggest city Lagos early on Wednesday, critically wounding 12 soldiers and raising the prospects of a violent Christmas in the politically troubled African nation. Witnesses said a bus carrying about 60 soldiers was ripped apart by a bomb planted in a refuse dump nearby. It was the third bomb blast in Lagos in a month. "No one is dead but 12 soldiers are critically injured and are in hospital," said an official of Lagos state government. "Some civilians have also been injured but not seriously," he said. Residents of Lagos, the bastion of opposition to Nigeria's military government, said they feared the spate of bomb attacks could lead to a violent Christmas season. Lagos state military administrator Colonel Muhammed Marwa survived a bomb attack on Monday and three people died in a car bomb explosion last month. "Everyone is afraid because we don't know when or where the next attack will be," said estate agent Christopher Njoku. On Tuesday, the U.S. state department said it had received information that bomb attacks might take place at Nigerian airports during the last two weeks of December and warned Americans travelling to the country to be cautious. Many people have condemned the attack on Marwa, who has been popular in Lagos for repairing the city's potholed roads. So far no one has claimed responsibility for the recent wave of bomb blasts in Nigeria but police say the explosion in November was the handiwork of the exiled opposition. It said the attack on Marwa, a close aide of military ruler General Sani Abacha, had a striking resemblance to the November incident that killed three people, including the head of the airport security, in a bungled car bomb explosion. Police said the victims were agents of exiled opposition leader and Nobel prize winner for literature Wole Soyinka. Soyinka leads a group based abroad known as the National Liberation Council of Nigeria (NALICON) which has vowed to topple Abacha. NALICON is allied to the umbrella opposition group, the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO). Last week the military administrator of the southwestern Ondo state, Navy Commander Anthony Onyearugbulem, visited NADECO's 88-year-old leader Michael Ajasin in his home in Owo and tongue-lashed him for holding meetings of opponents of the military government in his home. "At your age, what kind of society do you want to leave behind?" Onyearugbulem asked Ajasin. Opposition sources said the government, smarting from the bombing incidents, could resume its crackdown on opponents. Many people are already in detention in Nigeria, among them Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of a 1993 presidential poll whose annulment plunged the country into crisis. Abacha seized power in the chaos that ensued and has pledged to hand over to a democratically elected president in 1998 but his critics say his agenda is to hang on to power. Nigeria is treated as a pariah over its human rights record and last year's hanging on murder charges of nine minority rights activists including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, which caused its suspension from the Commonwealth.
CCAT	A Canadian company said on Monday it agreed with India's Vatsa Corp. Ltd. to develop an ocean theme park near Bombay. SeaParks Entertainment & Attractions Corp. of Vancouver signed a memorandum of understanding with a Vatsa subsidiary. The partners envision building several sites in India at a cost of about $75 million each, SeaParks Chief Executive Bruce Fuller said. The theme park would be designed around the concept of undersea exploration and combine environmental education, water rides and wildlife displays. While details of the agreement with Vatsa had not yet been finalised, the Bombay park would take about two years to build once arrangements were completed, Fuller said. SeaParks is also negotiating joint ventures to build parks in South Korea and Japan. The private company, founded in 1991, has not yet built a park based on its concept. Asia is the target market for the parks because of its strong economic growth and rapidly expanding middle class. "We know tourism and the middle class are booming in India," Fuller said. He said Vatsa was developing an $800 million theme park near Bombay. The SeaParks project would not be part of that development.

The Central Statistical Service said gross domestic product (GDP) rose a seasonally adjusted and annualised 3.2 percent in the third quarter from a revised 3.7 percent second quarter rise. But stripping out agriculture -- which was boosted 54.6 percent in the period by a bumper maize crop -- left the core economy growing just 0.5 percent quarter on quarter, down from 1.8 percent in the second quarter. The flat non-agricultural performance reflected a further decline in mining, which fell 7.0 percent, and a 0.5 percent decline in manufacturing. Bond dealers said the headline figure of 3.2 percent was slightly stronger than expected, but market reaction was muted as traders digested the figures. A Reuters poll of economists forecast a third quarter rise of 2.5 percent, with ideas ranging widely from 1.0 to 3.5 percent. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003
ECAT	British trade figures due on Wednesday will probably show the trade deficit with the rest of the world widened in December, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Their consensus estimate was for a December trade gap of 1.014 billion stg after a November shortfall of 959 million. The December global trade data will be released on Wednesday at 0930 GMT at the same time as January figures for trade with non-European Union countries. January trade with EU nations will be included in the January global figures due in March. Economists said last month's figures showed a surprise fall in exports. They will watch keenly to see if that phenomenon has continued. "While we do expect sterling's rise to depress export growth, this will take some time to work through," said Ciaran Barr, UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "Accordingly, we expect a modest rebound in non-EU export levels in this month's data." The Reuter poll has an estimate of 793 million stg for Britain's non-EU trade deficit in January, down from 844 million in December. The pound has risen about 16 percent on a trade-weighted basis since last August. A rising currency classically produces a "J curve" effect and this time is no exception. As a currency appreciates it cuts import prices and raises export prices. With trade volumes slow to react to price changes, the trade gap will narrow, in value terms, in the short-run -- the so-called J curve. But as price changes shift the dynamics of supply and demand, the strong pound will eventually force a deterioration of Britain's trade position as export markets shy away from the higher prices imposed by the pound. The reverse, of course, applies to imports which look ever cheaper to the now confident British consumer. "Once the beneficial impact of sterling upon export and import prices has washed through the system we anticipate a marked widening in the deficit as the loss of competitiveness feeds through into volumes," said David Philpotts, UK economist at Schroders. Barr agreed that the underlying trend in 1997 will be for higher trade deficits. For Britain's global trade gap, Philpotts said the fall in import prices was already being more than offset by an acceleration in import volumes. He noted that the non-EU trade deficit widened by 145 million pounds to 844 million in December and forecast a global trade deficit of 1.2 billion stg this time. Philpotts said evidence from the Confederation of British Industry suggested export volumes improved slightly in the New Year. The CBI's monthly industrial trends survey showed the balance of manufacturers reporting falling exports in December was minus 15 percent -- i.e. 15 percent more firms said exports fell than said they rose. That figure fell to minus eight percent in the January survey but widened back out to minus 12 in February. "With import penetration rising strongly, we are sceptical whether there will be any improvement in the non-EU trade deficit in January," Philpotts said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109
GCAT	Boris Becker's comeback shuddered to a halt amid the wind and rain at the German Open on Thursday, beaten 7-6 6-2 by Spain's Felix Mantilla, while the top-seeded Thomas Muster was blown away 6-1 6-2 by a storm of brilliance from a 23-year-old Moroccan Hicham Arazi. Six seeds failed to reach their places in the quarter-finals in a tournament which has provided ingloriously rapid dismissals for some other famous names. Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, seeded three,  lost 6-1 6-1 to Andrei Medvedev and Wayne Ferreira, the sixth seed, went down 6-1 6-3 to Sergei Bruguera of Spain. At least Becker had his moments. The three-times Wimbledon champion held a point to win the first set before going out 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 to the patiently rallying Mantilla, one of three Spaniards to make the quarter-finals. The German might have done still better had not rain delayed the match for almost an hour with the score at 6-6 in the tie-break. At that stage Becker was creating some attacking momentum in slippery, gusty conditions which hindered a serve-volleyer most of all. On the resumption, Becker twice approached the net a little ambitiously and saw two fluent backhands from Mantilla go past him. First set captured, the Spaniard gained in confidence, and Mantilla's superior ground strokes increasingly assumed control of the contest. Becker, who the day before had achieved his first win for 11 weeks in only his second tournament since aggravating a wrist injury, was left to contemplate what might have been. "The match was a bit different after the break," he said. Mantilla next plays Arazi, who can rarely have played better than while ousting clay court king Muster on his favourite surface. Arazi covered the court with great speed and intelligently mixed teasing backhand slices with bouts of brilliant hitting. He also launched fierce ambushes with sudden changes of pace on his serve and several times saw his shots skid off the line-tapes on important points. "I played without thinking," he said. "I couldn't understand what was happening. It was a very good day though I was a bit lucky, and at the end of the match I was always touching the lines." Krajicek departed with hardly a whimper.  The world number five seemed quite unable to adapt to the conditions and delayed the progress of Medvedev, who had won both their previous contests on slow surfaces, little more than 50 minutes. The eighth-ranked Chilean Marcelo Rios, trying to make his way back after a thigh injury, also looked well below par as he went out 6-4 6-1 to Spain's Alberto Berasategui.
MCAT	China's A and B shares ended sharply higher on Monday on a rebound after recent government anti-speculation measures led to sharp losses, brokers said. The Shanghai B index surged 3.178 points, or 3.66 percent, to 90.045 on turnover of $14.593 million, as local investors spilled over from the active domestic A share market, pushing volume significantly higher than last Friday, they said. The Shanghai A index soared 53.477 points, or 3.99 percent, to 1,395.339 on turnover of 8.46 billion yuan and the SSE30 blue chip index climbed 126.967 points, or 3.21 percent, to 4,080.126. "Institutions were active, which boosted follow-up buying and pushed the market up late in the session," one broker said. "There are signs that the market has started another run-up after consolidating at around 87 points for some time," another broker said. "The B share market will see 100 points this time if there is no major negative news in sight in the near future," he said. The Shenzhen B share index jumped 7.18 points, or 4.69 percent, to end at 160.26 on turnover of HK$93.2 million against Friday's HK$61.2 million. The domestic A share index leaped 22.61 points, or 5.09 percent, to 466.52 on turnover of 8.2 billion yuan. "Investors have stepped into the market in the final weeks before the Hong Kong handover on the assumption that the government would not crack down on the markets at this important time," an analyst at China Guotai Securities said. The British colony reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30. Beijing's measures to cool the markets in early May sent the A and B share markets into a tailspin. The indices had been up more than 50 percent from the beginning of the year. "But this is a rebound from heavy losses rather than the start of a new bull run," said an analyst at J&A Securities. Analysts said they expected choppy trading in the near future as volume rises. China Merchants Shekou Port Holdings Co Ltd was the best performer on the Shenzhen B share market, gaining HK$0.42, or 9.86 percent, to HK$4.68. The A share market leader Shenzhen Development Bank, which has been under investigation for alleged stock trading misconduct, was the most actively traded stock with volume of 21.2 million shares. It rose 1.18 yuan to 34.82 yuan. Shanghai Dazhong Taxi was the best performing Shanghai B share after the firm's shareholders approved a 10-for-10 bonus issue. The stock surged $0.168, or 10 percent, to 1.848 on volume of 586,700 shares. Pudong real estate company Shanghai Jinqiao Export Processing Zone Development was the most actively traded issue. Aided by institutional buying, it rose $0.05, or 6.94 percent, to $0.77 on volume of 2.2 million shares. ($1=8.3 yuan, $1=HK$7.8)

Share up 3.61 percent at 111.90 francs. UAP denied rumours of closer ties with Axa.   * Valeo down 2.64 percent at 302.60 after CGIP bought 20 percent stake from Cerus. Valeo head Noel Goutard said there would be no change in direction. * Essilor up 4.09 percent at 1,426 on the back of its nine month sales and statements by the chairman of Saint-Gobain, Jean-Louis Beffa, that he did not exclude closer ties between the companies. Transbourse's Patrick Leguil said the sales figures were in line with expectations and Beffa's remarks were not new. But he added that it "reminded investors that Essilor's strategy is good".
ECAT	Russia plans to return to the international capital markets soon with a dollar Eurobond, First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said. A statement quoting the minister and issued by Chubais's spokesman said the bond, running for at least five years, would be issued through SBC Warburg and JP Morgan, who managed Russia's first dollar Eurobond last November.   Chubais said the exact terms of the bond would be set on the eve of the issue by the Finance Ministry and managers, as usual. Russia's $1 billion Eurobond in November was the largest ever sovereign debut issue, but it was still heavily oversubscribed. The five-year 9.25 percent Eurobond was priced to yield 345 basis points over five-year U.S. Treasury notes. Russia was rated BB- by Standard & Poor's, Ba2 by Moody's and BB+ by IBCA for the issue. Russia issued a two billion mark Eurobond in March this year. The seven-year 9.0 percent bond was priced to yield 370 points over German government bonds, and managed by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and CS First Boston. --Jonathan Lynn, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
ECAT	Deals worth nearly $60 million were struck at the Eighth Trade Fair for foreign-Funded enterprises in China in Guangzhou, capital of southern Guangdong province, the Xinhua news agency said.

Most products on show at the fair were light industrial products such as washing machines, toys, water boilers, foodstuffs and handicrafts, it said.
GCAT	U.N. refugee chief Sadako Ogata left for Kisangani, headquarters of Zaire's counter-offensive against rebels in the east, on Saturday but security concerns put in doubt a planned trip to refugees trapped by the war. Relief officials said that Ogata, who is looking for ways of repatriating up to 300,000 Rwandan Hutus, might fly over the area if she was unable as planned to visit 120,000 weak and frightened refugees clustered around Tingi Tingi village. On the battle front, both Zairean military officials and rebels reported fighting at the gold and tin mining town of Punia, about 70 km (45 miles) south of Lubutu, which is close to Tingi Tingi. Ogata told reporters in the capital Kinshasa on Friday that she was looking at repatriation options with the government, whose forces are battling the Tutsi-led rebels for control of a string of towns on several fronts. "In theory, there are two ways of repatriating the refugees, by plane or by road through safety corridors," she said. In New York, the U.N. Security Council called for an end to hostilities, the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Zaire, including mercenaries, and demanded that combatants respect the rights of refugees. The refugees and Hutu hardliners blamed for the 1994 genocide of minority Tutsis in Rwanda fled west in December after attacks on their camps in the east. Many more fellow Hutus opted to return home, treking en masse in the other direction. Relief agencies pulled their international staff out of Tingi Tingi and Lubutu on Friday, saying panicky Zairean soldiers fired in the air and demanded money and vehicles from aid agencies. Lubutu is 200 km (125 miles) from Kisangani. Aid workers reported refugees fleeing towards Lubutu from Amisi, further down the road to the rebel-held east. The rebels responded to the much-trumpeted government counter-offensive by attacking on several fronts. Both sides have reported the fall or recapture of a handful of towns in the war zone, which stretches from a corner of the mineral-rich southern province of Shaba to the northeast. Rebels say they hold a large strip of territory along the borders with Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. Zaire, which accuses Rwanda and Uganda of invading in support of the rebels, said on Friday its army had retaken Watsa in the north east and Shabunda in the east. Zairean officials spoke of killing 800 rebels and taking Ugandan soldiers prisoners at Watsa. In the past, they have displayed Ugandan and Rwandan prisoners in Kinshasa. Veteran President Mobutu Sese Seko, meanwhile, returned to his Gbadolite jungle palace on Friday after medical tests in Europe. Mobutu, who had prostate surgery in August, denied asking Morocco for military help on a visit on his way home.
ECAT	The Dutch Finance ministry said on Wednesday the cabinet was considering a tax reform proposal to increase tax liability for company managers holding lucrative share options. "The fiscal valuation (of profit on options) has been on the modest side and there has been a lot of publicity about top managers getting options and paying only 7.5 percent tax on the underlying share price," a spokeswoman said. She said there would be a fiscal exemption for employees with options worth up to 2,000 guilders from the start of the proposed reforms. The new rules were planned to come into force from January 1, 1998, she said. The spokeswoman said the tax office would then look at the market value of the options as well as the underlying stock. Holders who cash in their options within three years will have to count their profit on the options as part of their total taxable salary, she said. The state expects to gather an extra 10 million guilders in revenue annually through the planned reforms, which still have to receive official approval, she said. In April, Prime Minister Wim Kok raised the possibility of introducing a capital gains tax to be levied on increases in the value of shares or other assets. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000
MCAT	The state-run Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) said on Saturday it had invited bids by June 7 for the import of 25,000 tonnes of white refined crystal sugar for delivery at Karachi port or nearby Port Qasim by July 31.   The TCP said it would also accept bids received by June 7 to supply the same quantity of sugar for delivery by August 15, but an official said this was an alternative delivery date and the corporation would buy a total of only 25,000 tonnes. The TCP bought 25,000 tonnes of sugar at $334.34 per tonne C&F last week after its May 11 tender for 50,000 tonnes. The Pakistan Sugar Mills Association says domestic sugar output reached 2.367 million tonnes by April 30 compared to 2.439 million tonnes at the same time a year ago. -- Karachi newsroom 9221-5685192
GCAT	Syria's ruling coalition has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of endangering peace and security in the region and called for Arab and world action to force him to abandon his hardline policies. "Netanyahu's policies are threatening both peace and security...the international community should move to put an end to this aggressive policy," the central leadership of the National Progressive Front said in a statement following a meeting on Sunday night. The front, a coalition of parties led by the Baath party, said the meeting, chaired by Vice-President Zuheir Masharqa and attended by Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara, renewed Syria's commitment to make peace with Israel. But it stressed that any settlement of the conflict with the Jewish state should be based on the land-for-peace principle, a formula rejected by Netanyahu's government. "The meeting discussed the irresponsible policies of Netanyahu which constitute a setback for the peace process, a rebellion against the principles on which the peace process was based, and a flagrant challenge to the Arab nation," the front's statement said. "Arab solidarity should be achieved to counter these current challenges," it added. The Syrian central leadership described Netanyahu's policies as "aggressive" and said he was "trying to undermine the peace process and to return it to the zero point". Syria has held sporadic peace negotiations with Israel since 1967 but no talks have been held with Netanyahu's government since it took over in June. The official Syrian newspaper Tishreen said no peace talks would be held with Netanyahu until he approved a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967. "Netanyahu's false statements on resumption of talks without preconditions do not convince anyone. They are merely a stupid manoeuvre which will not deceive Arabs or the world," it said in a frontpage editorial by chief editor Mohammed Khair al-Wadi.

ECAT	The NTC UK consumer industries' leading indicator fell for the second consecutive month in January, NTC economic and financial research said on Thursday. The fall, caused by slower growth in TV advertising revenues, declining growth in job centre vacancies, and consumer expectations of higher interest rates, follows record highs hit in the second half of last year, NTC said. "The indicator tends to move ahead of the general economic cycle by eleven months.... The recent downturn in the indicator signals a potential weakening in the rate of economic growth at the end of the year or early 1998." The NTC's indicator, which fell to 108.2 in January from 108.3 in December and record highs of 108.4 in October and November last year, includes a broad range of economic variables from the consumer sector. Taken together, these have a track record of providing advance indication of turning points in levels of consumers' economic activity, NTC said. -- Kate Kelland, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7708
CCAT	Ryerson Tull Inc, a metal distributor and processor, said Monday its gross profit per ton fell to $212 in the first quarter from $232 a year ago, reflecting weak industry-wide metals prices. Earlier, Ryerson reported first quarter net income of $16.6 million or $0.42 a share, down from year-ago results of $22.4 million or $0.57 a share. Ryerson said its first-quarter market share rose to an estimated 9.7 percent from 9.2 percent a year ago, based on Steel Service Center Institute data. "This market share growth, combined with strong service center industry shipment levels, produced an 11 percent increase in tons shipped," Neil Novich, president, said in a statement. First quarter expenses per ton dropped to $165 from $175 a year ago, he added. Volume gains and cost control efforts, however, were offset by the decline in the gross profit, Ryerson said.

GCAT	Talks on Monday between the leaders of Bolivia and Chile to improve bilateral ties failed to produce visible progress on a territorial dispute or the restoration of diplomatic relations. "We didn't discuss that," Chile's President Eduardo Frei said at a joint news conference with Bolivia's President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada when reporters asked about Bolivia's demand that Chile give it a sea outlet. Bolivia has sought access to the Pacific Ocean ever since losing its westernmost territory in a war with Chile in 1879. Frei said no timetable had been set for restoring bilateral ties, severed by La Paz in 1978 after talks aimed at giving Bolivia access to the sea through a territorial exchange failed to yield concrete results. Sanchez de Lozada said he hoped small steps forward in ties with Chile would eventually lead to the restoration of full diplomatic relations. The two leaders held a one-hour meeting in this central Bolivian city, where they plan to attend the 10th presidential summit of the Rio Group of 14 Latin American nations on Tuesday and Wednesday.

MCAT	Italian shares slipped back to a lower close on Friday after touching record highs as Wall Street showed sharp losses in the afternoon and profit taking set in on telecom stocks as a major Italian merger was completed. The all-share Mibtel hit another high of 14,928 before settling to close off 1.92 percent at 14,541, while the blue chip MIB30 opened at a new record 22,806 but again slipped back throughout the day to end down 2.26 percent at 22,096. Dealers said that after the early stock rise many investors cashed in on the day their monthly options expired and immediately sold shares. Telecoms slipped after the STET-Telecom Italia merger was completed today. The newly-merged group to be know as Telecom Italia SpA starts trading Monday. STET ended off 7.19 percent at 10,849 lire and Telecom down 5.08 percent at 6,220 lire.

MCAT	Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed down on Friday, with turnover falling to 6.21 million lots from 12.67 million. The annual rate for the most active three-day contract tumbled to 3.00 percent from 21.00 percent on Thursday and the seven-day contract ended down at 10.00 percent from 14.32. One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills. Traders said the day's falls were mainly due to a weak domestic A share market in the past two days and no new A share issues early next week, which drew money back to the repo market.   "The rate for the three-day contract was over 20 percent for a few days due to inflated short-term money demand because of new share issues this week," a trader said. "Borrowers only needed money for the short term. When they withdrew, the rates lost their main support and dropped." Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended up on a technical rebound after sharp losses in the past few days, traders said. The most active 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 closed up at 121.99 yuan from 121.33 yuan.

ECAT	Australia's small business sector is at its lowest point in four years, with trading conditions steady but flat, unchanged since June 1995, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants (CPA) said. The CPA said its CPA Small Business Health Index was at its lowest point in 15 quarters since the index began in April 1993. The index, which tracks the health of small business, also showed that the big four banks continued to make healthy returns from small business lending, handling 74 percent of small business loans, the CPA said.   The index has dropped to 103.6 for the December 1996 quarter, down from the previous low of 104.1 in June 1995 and down from the September 1996 quarter of 106 points. The CPA said that for only the second time since the index started, the 450 businesses surveyed reported a worsening in their performance during the quarter. It said the survey showed the average rate of interest paid by the 63 percent who said they had borrowings was 11 percent, three to four percentage points above the current home mortgage rates. About 37 percent of those surveyed said they had no loans or no interest payments, it said.   The CPA said that most borroweres were paying interest of 11.25 percent despite Reserve Bank of Australia data for December which indicated that the mean variable rate available to small business was 10.25 percent. CPA national president Scott Henderson said in a statement that the ongoing economic flatness was becoming entrenched. "As long as people are living with job insecuity they won't spend," Henderson said.   "Unemployment figures haven't changed and the government appears reluctant to deal with interest rates. In these continuing circumstances, small business is disinclined to invest and employ," Henderson said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
ECAT	The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday it has approved credits totalling $430 million for Romania, giving a boost to the new centrist government's economic reform programme. An IMF statement said the 13-month standby agreement was approved on Tuesday at an Executive Board meeting in Washington. The first instalment of about $86 million was being made available immediately, it said. Four additional quarterly instalments of the same size were "subject to observance of performance criteria and a review of the exchange rate policy". Two reviews of economic performance would be conducted in mid-August and mid-February 1998. The government and central bank had viewed IMF approval as the gateway for increasing foreign investment levels --among the lowest in ex-communist eastern Europe. "Foreign investors are reassured by recent developments in Romanian politics and this support from the IMF confirms that Romania is likely to pursue an economic policy attractive to foreign investors," one analyst said by telephone from London. Another analyst welcomed the news as positive for Romania's international image. There was "a strong appetite", she said, for future Eurobond issues. The IMF suspended credits to Romania last year after saying the leftist government had overspent and hobbled foreign exchange markets ahead of elections it lost last November. The poll defeat ended seven years of rule by ex-communists. The new government, committed to narrowing the gap in living standards with ex-communist Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, launched talks with the IMF and other international lenders immediately after taking office. To prove its mettle ahead of the IMF decision, the government rammed an austerity budget through parliament in record time and secured approval of laws on bank privatisation and ownership of land by foreigners. It also proceeded with a decision to close dozens of loss-making farms and factories. The Fund's statement said the main objectives of the government's reform programme were to reduce monthly inflation to about two percent in the second half of the year, cut the current account deficit to $1.4 billion from last year's $2.3 billion and increase foreign exchange reserves. It has set a budget deficit target of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product, down from last year's 5.8 percent. The statement acknowledged the need to "cushion the most vulnerable part of the Romanian population" by increasing social security spending to 10 percent of GDP. The government launched its stabilisation programme in February, introducing tough monetary policies and freeing prices on staples and utilities which pushed monthly inflation to over 30 percent last month. An IMF mission in Romania this month said the government's 1997 inflation target of 90 percent was feasible but ambitious after posting 76.5 percent in the first quarter alone.

The day's downward price trend was influenced by a slight dip in August unleaded gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), which settled 0.01 cent a gallon to 60.04 cents. August crude, which expires Tuesday, fell nine cents a barrel to $19.18 cents. The lower prices reflected concerns of increasing supplies now that the United Nations and Iraq appear to have agreed on final terms for the oil-for-food deal, which will renew exports from the Middle East producer. LOS ANGELES: Traders offered July and August CARB gasoline to Los Angeles refineries at 58.50 cents and 59.50 cents a gallon, traders said, 0.50 cents under Friday. CARB diesel edged up slightly, to 56 and 57 cents a gallon, a half cent over Friday's levels. Shell Oil Co's refinery in Martinez, Calif, near San Francisco, was operating normally Monday following a extremely short fire in an asphalt making unit Saturday. The fire, extinguish within minutes, failed to disrupt production or supplies to custmers, a company spokesman said Monday. SAN FRANCISCO: State-mandated CARB gasoline fell in line with L.A., and was talked at the same levels as Los Angeles. CARB diesel fuel remained about five cents under L.A. due to overproductionn.

ECAT	The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Friday defended its key Consumer Price Index from criticism made late last year by a blue-ribbon commission. In a report responding to the Boskin Commission study, BLS researchers questioned several of its assumptions and rejected many of its conclusions point by point. The commission, headed by Stanford University economist Michael Boskin, concluded in December that the CPI overstates inflation by about 1.1 percentage point per year. In its response, the BLS charged the Boskin commission with making numerous inaccurate inferences based on faulty or incomplete data. The paper also noted that the BLS is engaged in several programs to improve the accuracy of the CPI. "The BLS specifically rejects several of the estimated quality or new goods biases, in cases where the commission presented new evidence," the BLS study's authors said. The paper was released at a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, which had requested a BLS response to the Boskin report.   The BLS partially agreed with Boskin that the CPI's failure to account for switching between similar goods when prices move has artificially inflated the index. And it agreed that upper-level substitution bias adds about 0.15-percentage point to CPI annually. But the paper disagreed that lower level substitution bias adds up to 0.49 points a year. "The commission fails to mention several strong assumptions about the distribution of price changes that they implicitly use," the report stated. The BLS also disputed Boskin's assertion that unmeasured quality gains in new and improved goods add 0.61 percentage points annually to CPI. The BLS highlighted shelter, apparel and upkeep, and new and used cars -- which Boskin said together account for 0.16 of the 0.61 points -- citing lack of evidence and poor estimates. "In each of these cases, there are significant problems with the inferences drawn by the commission," the report said. Estimates of a 0.34-point bias in medical care and high-tech consumer goods involved "some degree of speculation and extrapolation," the BLS report continued.   In addition, the paper said its current experimental CPI, which uses a geometric rather than an arithmetic mean to account for substitution bias, lowers the growth of CPI by about 0.25 percentage points a year. The BLS agreed with Boskin's recommendation that CPI should be fashioned as much as possible as a cost-of-living index. Many key U.S. economic inputs, including tax payments and entitlement spending, are tied to CPI. But the paper asserted that current efforts to improve CPI would take years to bear fruit, and may never catch up with the mercurial U.S. economy. "The solutions to many CPI measurement issues ... must await methodological breakthroughs in economics or improved availability of data," the report concluded. ((-- Chris Stetkiewicz, 202-898-8377 ))
CCAT	Polyolefins group Borealis Holding AB said in a statement on Friday it had signed a letter of intent to sell its car interior parts maker Borealis Industrier AB to Lear Corporation of the United States.

ECAT	Improved tax collection has left the South African government on target to achieve its four percent budget deficit target in 1997/98 despite acute pressure on spending, economists say. Finance Minister Trevor Manuel is expected to deliver a constrained budget to pacify financial markets on March 12, they said. According to a Reuters poll of 10 economists, Manuel will announce real spending cuts, although not as deep as some reports have suggested. The consensus forecast was for expenditure in 1997/98 (April-March) of 189.9 billion rand, 7.8 percent up on this year's revised total of 176.1 billion. After allowing for inflation of nine percent, this represents a real cut of just over one percent. South African papers reported last year the cabinet had agreed a figure a spending figure of 186 billion, but analysts say such a low number looks unrealistic. Citadel Investment's Louis Fourie, explaining high expenditure, said: "We're still in the process of revamping South Africa and paying farewell packages to civil servants. We're not normal yet." On the revenue side, analysts expect 164.7 billion, up from 147.4 billion this year, thanks to good progress in improving tax collection. That would give a deficit of 25.2 billion, representing 4.05 percent of gross domestic product compared to the 5.1 percent budgeted for 1996/97. Privatisation receipts of two to three billion rand should help swell government coffers, but some economists said markets did not want to see this money used to cut the deficit. "You can't include it in the budget. That's bad. The markets won't like it," said BOE NatWest economist Nick Barnardt. Manuel has made deficit reduction a central plank of his economic strategy. The government's Growth, Employment and Redistribution plan, published last June, called for a budget deficit of four percent in 1997/98, falling to 3.5 percent in 1998/99 and 3.0 percent in 1999/2000. "The deficit and government dissaving are being brought down over a period of time. The budget will be roundly welcomed by guys like myself," said Rudolph Gouws of Rand Merchant Bank. "They are broadly on the right track, and I like this sort of medium-term orientation." Revenue figures for the first 10 months of the current financial year paint a generally encouraging picture. From April 1996 to January 1997, revenue collections of 122.1 billion rand were 14.6 percent up on last year. "It's a given...Better tax collection is going to add quite a squeeze to budget deficits," Nedcor's Dennis Dykes said. George Kershoff of Stellenbosch University's Bureau for Economic Research was upbeat: "I'm quite confident about the budget. The Minister of Finance has really put his credibility on the line to reduce the budget deficit." But Equisec's Dawie Roodt took a more conservative view, saying 1997/98 would be a watershed year for the government to show it could avoid a debt trap. "If they can reach four percent then that's bullish news but it will be very difficult...The government's honour is on the line and real political determination could be forthcoming." The government has budgeted 34.4 billion for servicing its debts in 1997/98, a figure which could rise to around 41 billion rand in 1997/98. But Manuel says the debt burden is being brought under control, announcing this week that the government debt to GDP ratio should fall from 58 percent to 55 percent this year, the first decline in this key ratio in over six years. No VAT or major tax hikes are anticipated, except for the usual "sin taxes" against cigarettes and alcohol. There may also be an increase in the fuel levy, analysts said. The budget balance aside, the markets will also be waiting keenly for news on further relaxation of exchange controls around budget time after Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said on Tuesday he wanted to see individuals given some scope to invest abroad. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003

CCAT	StaffMark Inc said it is acquiring Baker Street Group, a professional staffing company based in Houston in a merger deal. Terms of the transaction, which will be accounted for as a pooling of interests, were not disclosed. Baker Street Group, with 1996 revenues of approximately $11 million, is its thirteenth acquisition, StaffMark said.   StaffMark, a staffing services company with more than 160 offices in 20 states, Canada, and the United Kingdom, said its latest acquisition will have a positive impact on its earnings per share for 1997. StaffMark, which went public in the last week of September 1966, was up 1-3/8 to 24-7/8, a new high, in midday trading on the Nasdaq.

CCAT	BESI Semiconductor Industries NV said on Tuesday it expected fourth quarter turnover and profits to be at the level of the third quarter of this year. "As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, net sales and net income are expected to approximate the levels reported in the 1996 third quarter," the firm said. But, based upon current backlog and order rates, both net sales and net income for the first quarter of 1997 are expected to be substantially below the 1996 fourth quarter indications, it added.   The firm said the decline in new orders and backlog for the third quarter of 1996 was the result of continued reductions in purchases of new semiconductor equipment by BE Semiconductor's principal customers. "Although we cannot predict when new order rates will stabilise or improve in relation to current levels, we can report that new systems order activity has increased in the month of October," the firm said. "Such rates are tied primarily to the performance of the overall semiconductor industry and the specific purchasing patterns and capacity needs of its customers," it said.   Earlier, the firm said it had posted Q3 profit of 6.7 million guilders versus a loss of 7.3 million guilders in the third quarter of 1995. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000 fax +31 20 504 5040
ECAT	The British Treasury's economic secretary, Angela Knight, said producer price figures on Monday signaled good news for consumer prices in the future. "Inflation at the factory gate is at its lowest for almost 30 years," Knight said in a statement read by a Treasury official. "Today's low inflation at the factory gate is tomorrow's good news for prices in the shops."   November producer output prices were unchanged from the prior month and were 2.1 percent higher than a year earlier. Seasonally adjusted input prices fell 3.2 percent in the month and were down 5.5 percent in the year. The input price fall was much deeper than expected, with markets looking for a 0.8 percent fall in the month and a 2.6 percent drop in the year. Economists on average expected a 0.1 percent November rise in output prices, with the range of forecasts running from flat to 0.3 percent higher. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 6784

CCAT	Rank Group Plc said on Monday that it regarded the potential returns on a proposed deal with Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc as inadequate and did not plan further talks on the issue. Trump Hotels said earlier that it had ended talks with Rank to purchase an equity interest in and to change the theme of Trump's Castle in Atlantic City.   "We explored the possibility of rebranding Trump Castle with Hard Rock branding, but having explored fully, frankly the returns as we perceived it just weren't going to meet our criteria," Rank spokeswoman Susan Donovan said. "So we decided not to pursue it any further," she added. Trump said it has pursued alternative re-theming options for Trump's Castle and a decision was expected shortly. --Brian Killen, London newsroom 44 171 542 7972
ECAT	Ministers from some 150 countries gather in Singapore next weekend for talks that could determine whether the world pushes on towards global free trade or slides into a new era of protectionism and competing power blocs. And signs are already flashing that the week-long meeting, the first Ministerial Conference of the two-year-old World Trade Organisation, will be far from the trouble-free encounter for which its organisers had prayed. After weeks of discussion and days and nights of often fierce argument over the text of a final declaration for Singapore, ambassadors to the Geneva-based WTO threw in their hand last Friday and passed the problem onto the ministers. Their failure means the gathering will almost certainly witness a degree of North-South confrontation that bodes ill for hopes of a fresh impulse to more freedom in world trade. At the heart of the debate are issues that have long divided major developed and developing countries -- trade and labour standards, textiles, the awarding of government contracts, or procurement, and the corruption this often involves. Others -- like national investment and competition policies designed to favour local firms, and when to get started on new global talks aimed at wider openings to agricultural trade -- cut across traditional North-South fault lines. But there is a more general disagreement -- on whether, as developing countries want, the ministers should focus on ensuring what was agreed in the 1994 Marrakesh world trade accord is being implemented rather than adding "new issues" to the the WTO's agenda as big powers would like. Also hanging in the air is the the proliferation of regional trade groupings, which could threaten the cohesion of the WTO and the global rules it was set up to administer, and of when the big absentees -- China and Russia -- might come in. Both, with nearly 30 other countries in the WTO waiting room, will be in Singapore along with the 125 current members of the body -- created in the 1986-93 Uruguay Round negotiations to replace the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero argues that the declaration should be a ringing affirmation of the ministers' determination to keep working through the organisation to bring down barriers to trade into the 21st century. He fought hard to get a text completed for the Singapore meeting -- from December 9-13 -- that would have more or less satisfied everyone and kept a common thread of accord. Ruggiero, and many analysts with him, fears that unless the free trade momentum is kept up anger among workers and farmers in North and South at the perceived effects on their jobs of the growing global market will overwhelm the politicians. The dilemma is that while North and South agree on where they ought to be heading, they differ sharply on how to get there and how fast they should be travelling. The governments of industrialised and developing states recognise they need to trade increasingly with each other  -- in both goods and the booming services that make up one third of world commerce -- to ensure their peoples' economic progress. But big power policy-makers -- especially in the United States and the European Union -- are under heavy pressure from economic and political protectionists who think tariff walls and last-ditch defence of "national sovereignty" can stave off the negative effects of globalisation. Increasingly, governments in the North feel the need to prove to sceptical labour and environmental lobbies that the WTO is not just working to the benefit of big multinational companies active across the global economy. So many richer countries, led by the United States, argue the WTO must address in some way the question of how far lower wages and scanty social protection in developing countries produces an unfair trade advantage in the form of cheaper goods. A U.S. push for the conclusion of a global deal in Singapore abolishing tariffs by the year 2000 on information technology products is partly driven by concern to show that freer trade can have a job pay-off in domestic "hi-tech" industries. Governments of developing countries face their own domestic sceptics on free trade and the value of the WTO, as protests in Manila during last month's meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) showed. And many of them -- especially the key Asian emerging economies -- feel the industrialised powers are not doing enough to meet their concerns, particularly in opening up for textiles and clothing, so refuse to budge on the "new issues." Despite U.S. and EU protestations to the contrary, they see the labour issue as a device to provide the big powers, under cover of the WTO, with an excuse to shut off access for even more their goods to the North American and European markets. They also argue that efforts by the EU to start talks on competition policy and by Canada and Japan, backed by Brussels, to discuss investment policy in the WTO are largely aimed at a total takeover of their domestic economies. There seems little room for compromise in Singapore, with key countries on both sides hinting that they would rather have no overall agreement -- and declaration -- at all rather than give in on their core demands. But one key envoy in Geneva voiced cautious optimism. "We here could not make the political decisions that were needed. When faced with the alternative, the ministers will surely find a way to keep the trading system on the tracks," he said.
GCAT	Britain is confident the European Union can reach agreement on further integration at a crucial summit next month but plenty of work remains to be done first, officials said on Thursday. The new Labour government has distanced itself from threats by the previous Conservative administration to veto the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) summit in Amsterdam unless the EU makes a number of concessions. "The Foreign Secretary thinks a deal at Amsterdam is possible -- there is a clear willingness in France and Germany to start talks," said an official. He was speaking a day after new foreign minister Robin Cook visited France and Germany to assure Britain's main EU partners that the government wanted to end the antagonism which marked the end of Conservative rule. The new administration has been quick to show a more positive face towards its European partners, while stressing it will be no pushover in negotiations. Officials said Britain especially wanted to see progress on the problem of "quota-hopping" -- the practice whereby foreign fishermen buy British boats to gain greater access to EU catch quotas. "Ministers need to look at quota-hopping and develop an approach. It's an extremely important issue for them," an official told reporters. "The government is avoiding talk of vetoing the IGC but has made clear there must be real progress on this issue between now and Amsterdam." British fishermen say quota-hoppers -- mainly from the Netherlands and Spain -- are driving them out of business. "I don't think there's any lack of understanding in France and Germany. The problem is the inflexible attitude of Spain. We need to be making progress before the IGC," the official said. Both the French and German ministers for Europe planned to visit London within the next two weeks for talks, he added. Jacques Santer, president of the EU's executive  commission, said in an article published on Thursday that Britain could be at a turning point in its relations with the EU. "This is what many friends of Britain want. That is not to say they expect the new government to compromise on its defence of Britain's vital interests," he added. Santer said the EU faced an exciting future and urged Britain to play a key role in it. He laid out the arguments in favour of a single European currency, due to be launched in 1999, but stopped short of arm-twisting Britain over European monetary union (EMU). "This EMU is not for turning," he said. "I am sure Britain will weigh all the arguments when the time comes and I hope the City of London and others will be fully prepared for EMU if Britain does decide to join." Labour has said it is unlikely Britain will join the single currency in the first wave, due to begin in 1999.
MCAT	U.S. Treasuries traded in London kept a grip on gains made in the U.S. session, but recent shock moves have left investors exhausted and unwilling to enter into major positions, traders said on Friday. This cautious approach, combined with a holiday in much of Europe to mark Assumption Day, has left the market high and dry. "There are hardly any flows to report," said a trader at a U.S. bank in London. "The market has been so choppy, and sold off so violently a couple of times recently that people are reluctant to get long." U.S. 30-year long bond at 97-24, yielding 6.54 percent compared with 97-22 in Tokyo and 97-23 at the New York close. Traders said the underlying sentiment is still healthy, as the latest data releases have confirmed expectations that inflation is under control -- and there's little sign that it will be an imminent concern. "I'd still be a better buyer of dips," said the trader. "The selling has been done." But in the short term, with the good news already priced in, traders said there is limited potential for Treasuries to break out of their range. The September futures contract was likely to remain in a range from 114-08 to 113-12. They were trading up 1/32 at 113-21 in automated trade. There was little data on the menu. The preliminary Michigan Survey for August due at 1400 GMT was forecast to give a reading of 107.2, up slightly from 107.1 previously. December Eurodollar futures were up 0.10 at 94.105 by 1040 GMT. -- Lisa Wilson. International Bonds Unit + 44 171 542 6137
ECAT	Hungary's deep structural reforms should help it avoid trade and current account problems which could arise from rising economic growth, Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy said on Monday. Medgyessy told Reuters in an interview that the economic restrictions which Hungary introduced two years ago were necessary to create conditions for sustainable growth, but alone were not sufficient to spark growth. "The restrictions are not sufficient, because if (they) do not come along with structural reforms, (economic) balance problems may return," he said. "That's why the government's decision (last week) about the pension reform has an enormous significance." He added that the decision also outlined reform measures in the health care system. The pension and health care reforms will be operational in 1998 and 1999 and guarantee that ecconomic growth is sustainable, Medgyessy said. -- Sandor Peto, Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327 4040
CCAT	Shares in recently-unbundled South African firm Malbak Ltd were up 4.72 percent on moderate turnover Thursday as an earlier cautionary spurred talk it was a takeover target. At 0850 GMT Malback was changing hands at 710 cents, 32 cents higher on the day after 428,300 shares had changed hands. "The rumor's pretty well known in the market that Rembrandt is bidding for Malbak," said one share dealer. Malbak earlier warned it was in talks that might have an effect on the share price.   The dealer noted of Thursday's total volume, about 225,000 shares were traded in one overnight deal, generally an indication of a foreign trade. South Africa's Business Times newspaper reported on Sunday that it was "common knowledge in the market" that Remgro (Rembrandt) was keen to buy Malbak and merge their packaging interests. Another dealer said a few players had pulled their sell orders after the cautionary, which might be inflating bid prices. An analyst who asked not to be named said a fully priced bid for Malbak would have to be at 700 cents. Remgro's packaging operations are held largely through a 30 percent stake in Printpak and a 17 percent stake in Lenco Holdings Ltd, the Business times said. Lenco's stock surged or 17 percent or 105 cents to 720 cents -- a new year high -- in light trade. Malbak's primary assets since the unbundling are a 68 percent stake in Kohler Ltd and a 64 percent interest in U.K-listed MY Holdings Plc. Remgro shares were last traded at 4,595 cents, down five cents. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003
ECAT	Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Thursday the government would not be influenced by initial issues identified in its financial sector inquiry when making final recommendations. "It is appropriate for the government not to pre-judge any of the issues identified by the inquiry at this stage," Costello said in a statement.   The inquiry, headed by prominent businessman Stan Wallis, left open the option of mergers among Australia's big banks and takeovers of local banks by foreign banks in an interim discussion paper released earlier on Thursday. The paper said the key aim of any reforms should be to increase the efficiency of Australia's banks to compete globally. It also said new technology would transform the sector. Policy set by the previous Labor government has stopped mergers or foreign takeovers of Australia's four largest banks and its two largest insurance and superannuation groups.   The inquiry's final report is scheduled for release in March next year after further reviews. -- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730
CCAT	The initial public offering of 2.1 million common shares of Spatial Technology Inc has been postponed due to "market conditions," lead underwriter Dain Bosworth Inc said Monday. The Boulder, Colo.-based company, which develops software used to create and modify three-dimensional shapes on a computer, was expected to make its market debut in mid- October on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "STGY." A syndicate representative at Dain Bosworth said he did not know if the deal, with an estimated value of $21 million and expected to price between $9 and $11 a share, would resurface.
MCAT	Taiwan's central bank said on Friday it would issue T$3 billion in 14-day negotiable certificates of deposit later in the day. Bids would close at 11.15 local time (0315 GMT), a central bank official said. The issue coincides with a long bull run in Taiwan's stock market, where the index has pushed to a series of seven-year highs in recent weeks on record-breaking turnover. The central bank's repeated NCD issuance has been seen widely as a bid to cool the sizzling stock market, which has siphoned huge flows of liquidity out of the banking system.   The central bank has said repeatedly it would not adjust monetary policy merely to cool the red-hot stock market, but would continue to use issues of NCDs and treasury bills to fine-tune money supply. The stock market closed sharply higher on Thursday with the weighted index rising 251.36 points or 2.68 percent at 9,632.42. On Friday, the stock index opened higher by 103 points or 1.07 percent at 9,735.50. -- Taipei Newsroom (886-2-5080815)
GCAT	A 22-year-old Israeli sewer cleaner has died choking on the same poisonous vapours that killed his father and two brothers nearly a year ago, his family said on Wednesday. Residents found Oren Levy of Matzliah in central Israel dead in a manhole on Tuesday on the same sewer in which his father Yisrael, 55, and brothers Koby and David died from fumes last September. Those deaths had shaken Oren but his mother Mazal Levy told Channel Two television: "He wanted the work of his father to go on, that all of the (business) empire which he built up for 30 years wouldn't collapse." Relatives said Oren Levy refused to use a gas mask.
ECAT	Economic confidence among European businesses and consumers improved sharply in February, reflecting stronger orders and better employment prospects, the European Commission said on Monday. In its monthly survey of economic sentiment, the European Union's executive found that confidence was "augmented strongly in February, reflecting improvements in all sectors." The February index jumped to 101.1 from 100.3 in January. In 1996 the confidence measure averaged 98.9. Among the areas showing noticeable improvement was the construction industry, where upbeat employment expectations brought the sector's index to its highest level since December 1995. In Germany, while the overall sentiment barometer rose for a fifth consecutive month, consumer confidence worsened due to growing worries over personal finances and the broad economic backdrop. Germany has been struggling under record unemployment levels, a development that is likely to have contributed to the more gloomy assessment by consumers, officials said. Another factor contributing to the February rise in EU sentiment was the ongoing increase in share prices. While the weight of share prices in the EU index is only one sixth, the sharp rise in European markets since the beginning of the year has nonetheless had a positive influence on sentiment. -- Brussels Newsroom 32 2 287 6800
GCAT	An Israeli shot and wounded one Palestinian on Monday in West Bank violence coinciding with a crisis visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, police said. A police spokeswoman said a second Palestinian who was initially believed to have been shot had lightly hurt himself when rushing to help the man who was shot. "There is a positive development in the investigation that will help catch the suspect that shot and seriously wounded one Palestinian," the spokeswoman said without elaborating. Palestinian witnesses said a Jewish settler fired on students and others in Kharbatha village, 17 kms (11 miles) west of Ramallah. A Palestinian hospital treated two Arabs. One was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the chest. Israeli police were looking for the gunman. They said he opened fire after Palestinians pelted his car with stones and then fled in the car. But villagers said the settler appeared to be looking for a confrontation. They said he had been deliberately driving near the school for some time even though the Israeli government had built a bypass road for Jews in the area. The Palestinian Authority, which controls eight West Bank towns including Ramallah, administers Kharbatha. But the village is under full Israeli security jurisdiction. Netanyahu was due to meet President Bill Clinton later in the day as part of a U.S. effort to rescue peacemaking. The West Bank and Gaza have been rocked by unrest since Israel broke ground on March 18 for a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. Three Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire and scores of people wounded. "A settler got out of his car and began to shoot...The students ran away and after that the settler himself...began to fire in the air and randomly," a Palestinian witness said. "After that he shot two people from our village, one to his chest, and his case is not very good," he said. A Jewish settler spokesman said the man opened fire in response to "massive stone-throwing". But Khaled Injas, of Kharbatha, said: "I don't know why he comes to this village every day. They have their own road." Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's aide Tayeb Abdel-Rahim told Israel's Arabic-language radio on Monday the Palestinian Authority was considering sending two senior negotiators to Washington in answer to a U.S. invitation. Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who returned on Sunday from talks in Washington, said a closure which Israel tightened in the West Bank and Gaza after a March 21 suicide bombing in Tel Aviv would remain in effect. Some 130,000 Jews live in settlements scattered among more than two million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
GCAT	Poland, anxious over events in Belarus, on Tuesday hastily prepared initiatives to support democracy and sovereignty in the neighbouring state where President Alexander Lukashenko was clashing with parliament. Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski said Warsaw was sounding out Ukraine and Lithuania on a possible joint statement by the three presidents. "We cannot regard what is going on in Belarus on the basis of saying "it's not happening in our house and it's none of our business'," PAP news agency quoted Kwasniewski as saying. He said the proposed statement would say that Belarus sovereignty was in Europe's interests and the three countries were ready to support everything that served democracy, the rule of law and the economic development of Belarus. Kwasniewski's spokesman Antoni Styrczula told Reuters the president had repeatedly written to Lukashenko, saying democratic reforms in Belarus should continue and human rights and media freedoms should be respected. The strongly pro-Russian Lukashenko, defying parliament and the constitutional court, has called a referendum on Sunday in a bid to increase his powers and extend his term by two years. Critics accuse him of dictatorial tendencies. After a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said the cabinet would support "all initiatives aimed at a conciliatory solution to disputes and conflicts." Warsaw politicians fear that political and economic instability in Belarus could complicate its NATO entry plans and harm its economic interests, and might even provoke a cross-border exodus of political dissidents seeking refuge. Poland hopes to join NATO soon, a goal strongly opposed by Lukashenko who echoes Russian arguments that the western defence alliance's eastward expansion could pose a threat to the former Soviet states. While opposition groups, including the Solidarity trade union have expressed strong support for Lukashenko's opponents, Polish authorities are keen to underline that they are not interfering in internal Belarus affairs. However parliament's foreign affairs committee proposed a resolution condemning any undemocratic moves that might menace the internal stability and sovereignty of Belarus. The lower house may vote on the draft on Wednesday.
ECAT	The Philippines' reserve money (RM) grew by 13 percent in June, lower than the 18 percent expansion allowed under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, the Central Bank said on Friday. "Latest Central Bank preliminary data on RM showed an overperformance of more than 10 billion pesos in June," a Central Bank statement said. The reserve money, which includes money in circulation and reserve balances of banks with the Central Bank, grew by 11 percent in May.   The Central Bank also said the year-on-year domestic liquidity (M3) growth was tempered at 17.5 percent in April, resulting in a level 36 billion pesos lower than the programmed ceiling. "We shall remain watchful on any possible pressure on inflation particularly on the demand side. We shall continue to look at the core inflation and that liquidity growth will be significantly more prudent than what is programmed," the statement added. The statement came hours after the National Statistics Office announced that June inflation rose to 4.8 percent from 4.2 percent in May. The Central Bank said the 4.8 percent inflation was lower than the 6.4 percent set under the IMF programme. Analysts said inflationary pressure might be heightened in the coming months following the speculative attack on the Philippine peso. The Central Bank raised its benchmark overnight rate to 24 percent from 15 percent to ward off currency speculators on Wednesday following Thailand's de facto devaluation. "(The) recent interest rate policy initiatives are temporary. There should be no spillover effects on investments and production as to impinge on the supply side and stoke inflationary pressures," the Central Bank added. -- Manila Newsroom (63 2) 841-8938 Fax 817-6267
ECAT	Finance Minister Richard Hu will unveil a generally pro-business budget on Friday with few surprises, analysts said. "I'm not expecting any surprises," Jimmy Koh, regional economist at I.D.E.A, told Reuters. "If anything it will be pro-business so we might see another percentage point taken off the corporate tax rate to get to the 25 percent level, which is a long-term goal," Koh said. Analysts see the July 11 budget as part two of December 1996's interim budget, passed as a holding measure to guarantee expenditure plans ahead of the January 2 general election. The poll returned the ruling People's Action Party to power with 81 of the 83 parliamentary seats. Budget month is usually February in Singapore and with just seven months to go until the next one, commentators forecast little substantial change presented to parliament on Friday. "Last year saw lowering of corporate tax, flattening of the personal tax structure, changes to witholding tax and a drop in property tax. They might not jump straight in with more this time," said one tax accountant. "I think the government will want to keep something in reserve for next year," he added. Last year's tax give-aways cost the Singapore exchequer about Singapore $2.5 billion (US$1.7 billion). Analysts were reluctant to make predictions about the size of the expected budget surplus -- forecast at S$7.1 billion for the fiscal year to April 1997 in the February 1996 budget -- but they thought the level would be under pressure. "Revenues will have been hit by falling retail receipts and weaker exports so it's difficult to pin down the number," said one economist with a foreign bank who declined to be identified. Injecting vigour into the slowing Singapore economy -- seen growing at five to seven percent after years of double-digit expansion -- was viewed as a priority, as were measures to enhance regional competitiveness. Winnie Liew, tax partner at accountant Arthur Andersen, said aligning corporate and personal tax at the 25 percent level could be one option, as would be allowing consolidated offsetting of corporate tax in group accounts. "We hope consolidated offset will be allowed because it has been on the business wish-list for quite some time," she said. "There is a greater need for group offset as Singapore companies become increasingly diversified and become exposed to different parts of the economic cycle," she added. A third successive personal income tax rebate of 10 percent was thought unlikely by analysts, particularly as some 70 percent of Singaporeans fall outside the scope of its structure. Some analysts thought it more probable there might be some form of relief for lower income families in public housing. (US$1=S$1.43)

MCAT	--------------------------- Oct 18 ------------------------- *Banks stay within Central Bank's desired range ------------------------------------------------------------ The Philippine peso closed lower on Friday at 26.273 pesos to the dollar from 26.271 due to an interest rate arbitrage play for the weekend, traders said. "This is the usual weekend play," said a foreign bank dealer. The dealer said banks were selling dollars for same-day delivery so they could have the pesos that earn higher interest during the weekend. At the same time, banks bought dollars for delivery Monday to cover the dollars they sold.   The peso, however, was pulled down as banks took into account the swap points as a result of the interest rate differentials between the peso and the dollar during the weekend, traders said. The peso fell to a day-low of 26.279 pesos before recovering some ground at the close due to inflows of money for portfolio investments, traders said. The day's average was 26.275 from 26.265, with turnover falling to $104.50 million from $177.50 million. The Central Bank was not seen intervening in the market as it traded within its desired range of 26.24 to 26.28 pesos, dealers said. - LILIAN KARUNUNGAN (632) 841-8937
GCAT	Bulgaria will play two friendlies in Asia next month ahead of their European group five World Cup qualifier against Cyprus on December 15. They will play Saudi Arabia on November 6 and Thailand on November 8, according to Bulgaria's Football Union (BFU) spokesman Nikola Exerov. Local media quoted team coach Hristo Bonev as saying he would experiment with new s in the two matches. Bonev said he would meet Barcelona striker Hristo Stoichkov in Belgrade on October 31. He declined to comment on Stoichkov's long-running feud with the BFU, which resulted in him missing Bulgaria's first two World Cup qualifying matches.
GCAT	The mother-in-law of a doctor who treats Russian President Boris Yeltsin was stabbed to death on Tuesday, but officials said the doctor would continue looking after the Kremlin leader, who is preparing for heart surgery. Public Russian Television (ORT) said Anna Ichko, 70, was found dead in her flat with two knife wounds. Relatives nearly caught one of the attackers, who jumped off the balcony of the apartment as the relatives tried to open the front door. An investigator told the television the incident looked like a robbery and appeared to have no political motive. Ichko was mother-in-law of doctor Vladlen Vtorushin, who has been treating Yeltsin for over two years, ORT said. "Vladlen Vtorushin is a strong man. He will be able to cope with this tragedy and there is no need to replace him," it quoted Sergei Mironov, head of the Kremlin medical centre, as saying. The ORT anchorwoman took a more emotional line, recalling that a personal doctor of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was also killed earlier this year. "A natural question arises -- maybe now, ahead of the president's operation, we should not make public the names of those who would carry it out?" the presenter said. The 65-year-old Russian leader announced on September 5 that he would have heart surgery and moved into Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital on September 13 to allow doctors to prepare him for the operation. Over the weekend he moved to the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow. Russian heart surgeon Renat Akchurin is expected to lead the operation, expected in up to eight weeks.
GCAT	Sicilian Archbishop Salvatore Cassisa, one of the highest-ranking Catholic Churchmen ever to face Italian justice, went on trial on Wednesday on charges of corruption and defrauding the European Union. Cassisa, of the Sicilian town of Monreale, was not present at the start of the trial in Palermo's justice palace, where he stands accused along with five other people on various counts. He tops a charge sheet compiled by Palermo prosecutor Luigi Patronaggio. The 75-year-old prelate, who denies wrongdoing, faces up to four years in jail if convicted. The prelate is charged with extortion and attempted extortion connected to bribes the prosecution says were demanded from construction companies and artisans seeking contracts for work on Monreale cathedral from 1990 to 1993. Cassisa is head of a foundation administering the splendid 12th century Norman cathedral complex just outside the Sicilian capital. Ordered built by William II, it is considered one of the architectural wonders of the Middle Ages. The prosecution charges that Daniela Lima and Fulvio Lima, respectively the foundation's building supervisor and administrator, demanded bribes at a rate of about 10 percent of the value of each reconstruction and restoration project. It alleges that Cassisa, the foundation's president, was in complicity with the two Limas over the bribes. Cassisa told prosecutor Patronaggio he was not aware of bribes. "We aim to dismantle the accusations point by point," Cassisa's lawyer Angelo Bonfiglio told Reuters. Bonfiglio said Cassisa was the victim of "internal cannibalism" by priests in Sicily who wanted to smear him and were the first to tell magistrates of alleged irregularities. In one episode, the three are charged with demanding a bribe of 50 million lire ($30,000) from one construction company. Other, smaller bribes were demanded for projects to restore some of the cathedral's famous gold mosaics. Archbishop Cassisa is further accused of nepotism in distributing contracts and of diverting funds from the foundation into his private bank accounts. Patronaggio told the court in his opening statements that police who searched Cassisa's home in September 1994 found handwritten notes about the alleged bribes. The prosecutor also said police found documentation about various bank accounts including one with a balance of 1.5 billion lire ($900,000) set up in the Vatican Bank and destined for the Monreale seminary. He said they also found letters Cassisa had written to leading Italian politicians including former prime minister Giulio Andreotti asking for financial contributions to help restore the Monreale cathedral. In the other main strand of the case, Cassisa is accused along with two Sicilian agricultural inspectors of defrauding the European Union of some 200 million lire ($120,000). The prosecution alleges that Cassisa and two inspectors of a local agricultural board intentionally overstated the size of a Church vineyard which was put out of production in order to reduce wine production and receive an EU farm subsidy. Prosecutor Patronnagio's charge sheet says Cassisa reaped "an unjust profit and damaged others" through the vineyard scam. Investigators using aerial photographs determined that the vineyard that was uprooted was smaller than the 38 hectares Cassisa and the two local inspectors had declared. The trial was adjourned to March 18. ($1=1,663 lire)
MCAT	Hopes that Nawaz Sharif will win Pakistan's election may boost stocks temporarily, but renewed economic uncertainty after the February 3 polls could make any rally short-lived, analysts said on Sunday. The Karachi 100-share index gained 111.41 points to 1,452.72 points in seven sucessive sessions on expectations that Sharif, an industrialist seen as pro-business, would return to power. But the index fell back 21.27 points on Sunday a day after a bomb blast killed 26 people, including the leader of a militant Sunni Moslem faction, in the Punjab provincial capital Lahore. Most analysts said this could be a temporary setback unless the incident sparked widespread sectarian violence between Sunni and Shi'ite Moslem hardliners. "The market has built up on expectations of Nawaz Sharif becoming the next prime minister," Jahanzeb Naseer, research head at Jardine Fleming Broking Pakistan, told Reuters. President Farooq Leghari called the elections after sacking Benazir Bhutto's three-year-old government on November 5 on disputed charges of corruption and misrule. Naseer said most investors had beefed up their portfolios to pre-empt an expected post-election rally, adding that the market could rise another 100 points before polling day. Kalim Aziz, research head at ING Baring Securities, said that assuming the Lahore blast did not have major repercussions, the market can rise 50 points before the elections and another 100 points if Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League emerged as winner. "Sharif is perceived to be business-friendly," he said. Given current fundamentals and the more optimistic mood, the index should reach 1,550 points before polling day and a post-election rally could take it to 2,000, he said. "Based on market fundamentals at the moment, any fall below the 1,500-point mark will be illogical and any rise above 2,000 will be sentimental," Aziz added. Naseer said concerns about the health of the economy would dominate the post-election scenario. "Any post-election rally is likely to slow down within a month as the euphoria wears off and the economy will again be in focus," he said. He said the economy had shown little improvement over the past few months and was unlikely to perform well with an average of $1.25 billion due in quarterly foreign debt repayments. "The rupee will remain under pressure as the forex reserves level remains unsatisfactory, while inflation seems to be on the rise," he said. Aziz said the economy would remain worrisome until Pakistan returned to a lending programme under the International Monetary Fund's enhanced structural adjustment facility. Pakistan's caretaker government persuaded the IMF to resume a stalled standby loan in December, but the fund has yet to disburse an $80 million tranche due in mid-January. Anisur Rehman, research head at Crosby Securities, said jitters about the economy might keep the index below 1,600. Any rise above this level should be considered as a chance to exit.
MCAT	Swedish shares ended lower on Wednesday after coming off mornings highs on international worries ahead of the second round of French elections. The bourse's general index fell 0.39 percent to 2,840.10 in turnover of 5.4 billion crowns. "It's the French election that's casting a shadow on interest rates and the bourse," a dealer said. "Unfortunately it will probably remain this way the rest of the week." Automotive group Volvo and fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz belonged to the few winners. Volvo rose two crowns to 216, partly lifted by saying its global truck order intake rose 32 percent in the first four months of the year. H&M jumped seven crowns to 260. Engineer Atlas Copco dropped eight crowns to 211. "Atlas Copco took a beating...its recent upturn feels unfounded," one broker said. Insurer Skandia fell one crown to 275 in continued profit taking. The share dived 17 crowns on Tuesday after surging 42 crowns in the previous two sessions as analysts upgraded the company's unit linked unit AFS. Heavyweights drugs major Astra and telecoms group Ericsson both fell. Astra slid 1.5 crowns to 129 and Ericsson slipped 0.5 to 274.
CCAT	Zeneca Group Plc's first-half results were welcomed by analysts on Thursday, despite a bout of jitters in early trading which saw the shares fall by more than 50 pence at one point. "They were extremely good and came in at the upper end of forecasts," said Merrill Lynch analyst James Culverwell. "Their comments on margins in the second half have really been flagged over the past two years, so it should be in everybody's forecasts." Culverwell said he was maintaining his forecast for full-year pre-tax profit at 1.090 billion stg. By midafternoon shares in Zeneca had recovered to trade down just 2 1/2 pence at 20.41 1/2 stg. "Overall the underlying performance is looking pretty good," said Dresdner Kleinwort Benson analyst Steve Puttnam. "The market got spooked about currency and launch costs," said Puttnam, who has shaved 20 million stg off his full-year forecast to bring it to 1.055 billion stg, reflecting the expense of drug launches.   Puttnam also praised the way Zeneca handled concerns about new asthma pill Accolate, which caused flutters last week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended a change in labelling because of a possible link to six cases of a rare asthma-related condition known as Churg-Strauss Syndrome. "It is really nothing to do with Accolate at all," he said. Daiwa's Keegan added; "I think the concerns about Accolate have been put to rest." Analysts were also pleased with the performance of the group's new wide-ranging fungicide Amistar, used on everything from crops to golf courses. The product notched up 45 million stg of sales in the first half, and chief executive Sir David Barnes told Reuters he expected sales of at least 150 million stg next year. "American Home Products recently indicated that the fungicide market was dull, and despite that Zeneca's fungicide is doing very well," Puttnam said. -- Jonathan Birt, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
ECAT	IMF backing for Pakistan's package of economic reforms is likely to boost local markets and attract foreign investors, analysts said on Saturday. "We have an industry- and export-friendly economic reforms package, the IMF's approval and the start of an India-Pakistan dialogue," said Anisur Rehman, head of research at SocGen-Crosby Securities. "All these developments combined are likely to provide a very positive environment for foreign investors to make their entry, " he said. The Karachi Stock Exchange's 100-share index ended 17.55 points lower at 1,598.94 on Friday after the announcement of the package, which dealers said fell short of expectations. Analyst Munir Ladha of AKD Securities said the fall should be seen as a "knee-jerk reaction" and the index would improve after investors had a deeper look into the reforms. Kalim Aziz, research head at ING Baring Securities. said tax and tariff cuts in the Friday reforms package will result in a 46 percent rise in earnings. The International Monetary Fund MF said on Saturday it welcomed the package announced on Friday and hoped it would provide a basis for adoption of an enhanced structual adjustment loan. "The successful implementation of the government's reform measures accompanying macro-economic improvements will provide basis for the adoption of multi-year arrangements under the concessional Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and Extended Fund Facility (EFF)," an IMF press statement said. Rehman said IMF approval of the package would draw foreign portfolio investors who moved to the sidelines after the Fund suspenced a standby loan earlier this month on Pakistan's failure to meet agreed targets. Top foreign ministry officials of Pakistan and India resumed peace talks in New Delhi on Friday, more than four years after dialogue broke down in January 1994 over the disputed Himalyan region of Kashmir. Tension over Kashmir sparked two of the three wars the regional arch-rivals have fought since independence in 1947. "The market is trading at its lower end, very near the bottom, and these developments should provide an attractive entry point," Rehman said.

GCAT	Thailand appointed a new national police chief on Wednesday to replace Pochana Boonyachinda, who was removed amid a series of police department scandals. General Pracha Promnok was appointed the new chief after Pochana was transferred to a post in the prime minister's office, the police commission said. Pracha, a respected senior officer, will supervise a scandal-plagued department of 200,000 staff. Thai police came under public scrutiny after allegations that six suspected amphetamine traffickers were shot dead by police for resisting arrest after being handcuffed. A recent study by the Chulalongkorn University also accused some officers of being involved in prostitution, drug trafficking and gambling. Deputy Interior Minister Chalerm Yoobumroon said on Wednesday that some police were involved in drug trafficking, particularly amphetamines, and vowed to crack down on offenders.
CCAT	The sale of Rio de Janeiro state bank Banerj, the first privatization of a Brazilian state-owned bank, hinges on Senate approval of a deal resolving Banerj's debts to its pension fund. Under the deal, Rio state will assume all of Banerj's debts to its pension fund, which will be covered by a 2.9 billion reais ($2.7 billion) loan from federal mortgage bank Caixa Economica Federal (CEF). Rio's state legislative Assembly approved the pension package Friday, an assembly spokesman said, but Congress' Senate still has to give its go ahead before the Banerj sell-off can take place as scheduled June 17 on the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange. Local press reports have been speculating that Banerj's sell-off may be delayed again because Senate approval might not arrive in time for the auction to take place. A spokeswoman for the Rio state finance department said the pension package had been sent to the Senate Wednesday. Rio state twice failed last year to sell the bank due to worries on debt. A total of six lawsuits which have been filed against the privatization of Banerj could also scupper the sell-off if any of them result in a court injunction against the sale. Banerj is due to be sold in a closed-envelope auction at a base price of 310 million reais ($289.7 million). Interested pre-qualified buyers had until 1200 local time/1500 GMT Friday to deposit guarantees with the stock exchange clearing house in order to pre-identify themselves for the auction.

MCAT	The Mediterranean was the star of the crude tanker market on Thursday as rates for 80,000 tonne vessels rose further after spectacular gains on Wednesday, brokers said. Cross-Med ships were fixed at up to W170, from the W155 seen on Wednesday when rates rose about 50 points, on continued high demand and an acute shortage of tonnage, they added. "There are a lot of orders, especially for prompt positions and end-January/early February. Most ships have disappeared. If there is just one left it will get good money," an Italian broker said. "The only fresh news is in the Med market," he added, noting that rates in other sectors were flat. The Middle East market showed little change with very large crude carriers (VLCCs) westwards fixed at W55 and to Japan around W65, while VLCCs on transatlantic voyages continued at about W62.5 from the North Sea to the U.S. and from West Africa. Rates for 130,000 tonners from West Africa showed a firmer tone. Although W95 was still being done on West Africa/U.S. trips, one broker said rates were date-sensitive with slightly higher numbers seem for later fixtures, especially to Asia. "You can't find the ships to China and Korea," he added. Inter-U.K./Cont rates for 80,000 tonners were steady at around W115, brokers said. Fuel oil was likewise little changed, with 25,000 tonne cargoes fixed at W195 inter-U.K./Cont and cross-Med around W190. In the U.S., 70,000 tonnes Caribs/upcoast continued to be fixed at around W167.5/175 and 50,000-tonne fuel oil cargoes Caribs/USAC at about W180. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 4088
ECAT	Businesses and consumers round the globe have an immediate reason to cheer the results of the World Trade Organisation's inaugural ministerial conference. Prices for a huge array of goods should fall following an agreement to scrap tariffs on computer chips and other information technology (IT) products, a market worth $600 billion a year and growing at an explosive pace. But the weeklong meeting may also be remembered as the conference that sowed the seeds of an important new round of negotiations to free up global trade in the 21st century. "Round or no round, the process of liberalisation after the negotiations today will go on very expeditiously," an ebullient Renato Ruggiero, the director-general of the WTO, said on Friday as the conference closed. Ruggiero, 66, had reason to be pleased. The reputation of global summits had been on the slide. Recent international conferences on development, the family and food security among others had been criticised as little more than talking shops. So when ministers from 128 member states of a body that operates by consensus gathered to shape an agenda for the turn of the century, expectations were understandably modest. But by the end of the week Ruggiero was savouring a deal to remove tariffs on IT that should give a powerful boost to the fastest-growing sector of the world economy and build voters' support for free trade by making everyday goods cheaper. He also skilfully steered the meeting, after long nights of haggling, to compromises over the work the Geneva-based WTO will begin on links between trade, investment, competition and government procurement. With some governments hoping the preparatory studies will lead to global rules to protect foreign investors and halt anti-competitive practices that skew trade, the talks could lead eventually to a vast extension of the WTO's reach. From the outside, nitpicking over nuances in a ministerial statement might seem hard to comprehend. But if the arguments were fierce, especially over whether to delve into the link between trade and labour standards, it was because ministers knew the longer-term stakes were high. "History has shown that generalised words should not be dismissed as waffle but rather regarded as the first foundation and building block for agreements," European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan told reporters. A new cycle of talks over farm products and services is due to begin in 1999 in any case as part of the follow-up to the 1986-1993 Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. The talks on agriculture, which excites political, economic and cultural passions like no other sector, are sure to be arduous. Some governments will insist on parallel negotiations in other areas to increase the opportunties for horse trading, which is what happened in the drawn-out Uruguay Round. Ruggiero acknowledged that the prospect of another full-blown round so soon stirs uneasiness in many capitals. But he said the speed with which major trading countries were able to thrash out an IT deal showed this need not be an insuperable obstacle to further trade liberalisation. "Things are changing, and they are changing fast. Before, there was the idea that no sectoral agreement could be reached if there was not a Round. And yet now we have reached an important agreement on IT in just a few months," he said. His conclusion? "When we are trading into the future, we are very fast. It is only when we begin to talk about textiles and agriculture -- the traditional sectors -- that negotiations are very difficult."
GCAT	An Australian immigration official said on Thursday that about 100 Sri Lankans had illegally arrived in Australia this year through a smuggling racket. "Investigations conducted by the (immigration) department indicate that there are people in Australia and Sri Lanka assisting people to get to Australia," a department official told Reuters. He said the Sri Lankans were using boarding passes given to them by people who checked in for flights but had no intention of travelling to Australia. In some cases, boarding passes for Australia were being swapped in airports for passes to other destinations, he said. The official said the Sri Lankans were originally arriving from either Hong Kong or Singapore, but these arrivals were decreasing after officers were sent there to assist with documentation checks. "In the past month, we have had no Sri Lankans come through Singapore, but they have moved to other Asian centres," he said. "Jakarta is now of concern." All the Sri Lankans that arrived here this year had applied for refugee status, but it was unsure if that would be granted, he said.
GCAT	Philippine President Fidel Ramos said on Friday he was confident that Christian opposition would fade to a peace deal Manila has initialled with Moslem rebels. He said the pact initialled on Friday in the Indonesian capital Jakarta contained several revisions limiting the functions of the proposed Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD). The agreement, which envisages the setting up of the SPCPD as a forerunner to a Moslem autonomous region, will be formally signed by Ramos and Moro National Liberation Front leader Nur Misuari in Manila on Monday. "With the modifications introduced in the final agreement after long negotiations ... I am confident that the opposition to the peace agreement will considerably be reduced and that eventually the peace and development process will be smoothly implemented," Ramos said in a statement. Among the changes in the peace deal were the making of the study of Islam in public schools optional instead of mandatory, and limiting the council's power to only those to be explicitly defined by the president. The Philippine government's chief negotiator, Manuel Yan, and Misuari initialled the peace agreement in Jakarta. In June, the government announced an interim peace deal, prompting fierce opposition from Christians who accuse the government of selling out to Moslems. Some five million Moslems regard the southern island of Mindanao as their ancestral homeland, although they are now outnumbered three-to-one by Christian migrants. The pact aims to end a 24-year separatist revolt which has cost at least 125,000 lives.
ECAT	Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong arrived in Harare on Friday for a three-day official visit aimed at forging closer political and trade ties with Zimbabwe. Goh is due to hold talks with President Robert Mugabe during his visit, while his 80-member delegation, including some leading industrialists, talks to their business counterparts. The team from Singapore told reporters it was interested in investment and trade in several areas such as infrastructure development, food processing, information technology and clothing manufacturing. Trade between the two countries was valued at Z$147 million ($13 million) in 1995, with the trade balance in favour of Singapore, according to the latest available official statistics. $1=11.1550
CCAT	Marubeni Corp, the partner of Malaysia's Wing Tiek Holdings Bhd in the Philippines' National Steel Corp, had settled $50 million for the country's largest steel firm, Acting Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista said on Wednesday. The payment is part of the $150 million due to the government as payment for 75 percent of National Steel Corp (NSC). The Wing Tiek group has to settle only $20 million to complete its payment. It had pledged to pay before the end of the month. Besides the $150 million payment to the government, Wing Tiek has also agreed to infuse new equity worth 2.3 billion pesos ($88 million). This is due by October 31. NSC accounts for over 40 percent of the local steel output with an annual production capacity of 3.5 million tonnes. - Manila newsroom (632) 841-8937
CCAT	JP Morgan & Co. Inc., the global banking firm, said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved the purchase of up to $750 million of its common stock in the open market or through private transactions.

MCAT	The Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) said on Wednesday that it would raise the margin requirements on its February and March rubber futures contracts, effective from Thursday. It will raise its margin requirement on the February contract by 10,000 yen per trading lot, bringing the total February requirement to 137,750 yen, TOCOM said in a statement. The margin for the March contract will also increase by 10,000 yen per lot to 62,500 yen. The increases are intended to cool overheated trade, TOCOM said. The requirement on other rubber contracts will be unchanged at 52,500 yen, it said.

ECAT	Failure to make progress on structural reforms of Japan's economy would raise concerns about the future direction of economic growth, Economic Planning Agency (EPA) Minister Shusei Tanaka told a news conference on Friday.   Tanaka, a member of the reformist Sakigake Party who lost his seat in the Lower House election last Sunday, is an ardent advocate of deregulation. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which fell 12 seats short of a majority in the Lower House election, is struggling to form a coalition to gain a majority, but it remains unclear whether it will succeed. Analysts fear deregulation and structural reform will not pick up speed under any new LDP-led government.   Tanaka, asked if he was aware of worries about the economy reflected in the decline in long-term interest rates, said the government had not changed its view, which is that the economy is on a gradual recovery path. "The reason we challenged the issue of economic structural reform from before the election was due to a strong sense of the urgency of reform. If deregulation proceeds, capital investment will emerge," he said. "If economic structural reform does not make progress, there is concern about the future of the economy."

GCAT	Most Republicans put on a brave face after a Capitol Hill appearance by Bob Dole and Jack Kemp on Wednesday, but one warned a poor showing at the top of the ticket would cost Republicans control of Congress. "Bob Dole is in a real uphill fight," Representative Chris Shays said. He said experts in the party believe Republicans stand to gain if Dole wins and hold their own if he loses by 55-45 percent but anything less than that would be a disaster. "Anything close to 60 percent (for President Bill Clinton) we're out of power," the Connecticut congressman told reporters. "So that's definitely a factor." But Republicans, who won control of both houses of Congress in the 1994 elections for the first time in 50 years, said that concern was not why less than half of the nearly 300 Republicans in Congress attended the Dole-Kemp rally. The real reasons, they said, were that many members were out of town, there was late publicity for the meeting, they were very busy and heavy rain slowed traffic. Dole tried to calm the fears of some Republicans that the election could turn into a rout. "I want to say to those faint-hearted people in the audience -- there are probably not very many --  don't worry about this election," he said. "We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win." Members tried to reflect his optimism despite his standing in public opinion polls, which show him 15 points or more behind Clinton. "I think we've got to be optimistic," said Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota, adding that he would welcome Dole into his state to campaign for him. "I'm not faint-hearted. We're going to win. He said it three times." Other senators also accentuated the positive. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said Dole's speech marked "real progress." Pete Domenici of New Mexico called it "uplifting" and Orrin Hatch of Utah said its message "will resonate." Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas said she was "optimistic" and Alfonse D'Amato of New York said the final result would be victory for the Republicans. But how can they win when Dole is running so far behind? Representative Jerry Lewis of California said in his state Dole was behind Clinton "by only 15 points ... in the nine counties outside Los Angeles he's dead even. We need to identify and deliver that vote. California's still in the mix." No matter what happens, Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour said he felt confident members of Congress would stay together with Dole and Kemp. "The fact of the matter is issues unify Republicans," he said. "The record of this common sense Republican Congress unifies our party." But Shays argued that it was Kemp and Dole who had walked away from Congress, not the other way around. "I want my presidential candidate to talk about what we have done in the past two years," he said, charging that Dole had failed to highlight the success of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's "Contract with America." That has allowed Democrats to define Congress in a negative way, he said. "This isn't an issue of our distancing ourselves from them, they basically have distanced themselves from Congress," Shays said of Dole and Kemp.
CCAT	Most U.S. commuter airlines have implemented higher safety guidelines that mirror those followed by major carriers, the Federal Aviation Administration announced Friday. Thirty-three out of 39 commuter carriers have adopted the new guidelines in an "unprecedented timeframe," the FAA said in a statement. The remaining six carriers are working with the FAA to certify their total 13 aircraft under the higher safety standards. "This rule sets new standards that will help us keep pace with the rapidly growing commuter segment of the aviation industry," acting FAA administrator Barry Valentine said. "This industry's outstanding performance demonstrates its commitment to safety." Under the FAA's new commuter rule, turbojets and passenger planes with 10 or more seats are operated under the same safety guidelines. Previously, there was a separate set of rules for commuters with 10 to 30 seats and another for planes with more than 31 seats. The higher safety guidelines adopted in December 1995 include certified dispatchers and dispatch systems, safety officers, ground deicing programmes, operations and flight attendant manuals and carry-on baggage programmes. The new safety standards are expected to cost air carriers about $75 million over 15 years. The cost to passengers is projected at 30 cents per ticket on planes with 20 to 30 seats and 62 cents per ticket on planes with 10 to 19 seats.
ECAT	China's broad M2 money supply was up 20.6 percent year-on-year at the end of April, an official of the People's Bank of China, the central bank said on Tuesday. Year-on-year M2 growth was 28.5 percent at the end of April last year.   M1, or currency in circulation plus current deposits, grew 18.7 percent in the year to the end of April, the central bank official said but gave no details. Year-on-year growth in M1 at the end of April 1996 was 13.7 percent. The China Securities said the main reason for the steady growth in M1 was an increase in the value of loans, which soared more than 7.0 billion yuan ($843 million) in February and 16.0 billion yuan in March. After two interest rate cuts in 1996, enterprises were reluctant to put their funds in fixed deposits, causing a rise in investment in production, the official newspaper said. Stable general demand was a cause of the continued decline in M2 growth, as growth in the demand for money had been restrained, it said. ($1 = 8.3 yuan) -- Beijing Newsroom (8610) 6532-1921
CCAT	Spain's Industry Ministry on Tuesday denied a press report that it had agreed with the Catalan regional government to merge regional electricity companies Fecsa, Enher and Hidruna. "We deny that report," a spokesman told Reuters, referring to an article in daily El Pais. The ministry said it was merely speculation about what could happen once new Catalan regulation on the electricity sector is applied. Electricity stocks have been jolted by a series of shake-ups in recent days linked to new sector regulation, due to be finalised in the next few months. Endesa announced on Friday it would bid for up to 75 percent of Fecsa and Sevillana and the stock market commission CNMV on Monday suspended trading in three more electricity stocks amid rumours of cross-buying. El Pais reported on Tuesday that Fecsa, Enher and Hidruna would merge under a single holding company, Energia Electrica de Catalunya SA, with shareholders' equity of just over 454 billion pesetas. The company would have four main divisons: nuclear, thermal, hydraulic and distribution. El Pais said the operation could not go ahead until after Endesa has completed its planned buy offer of Fecsa and Sevillana. Endesa already controls 91 percent of Enher and 100 percent of Hidruna, it said. --Madrid Newsroom +34 1 585 2167

ECAT	Yugoslav deputy prime minister Danko Djunic said talks with commercial bank creditors to reschedule $2.4 billion of debt adjourned on Monday with no deal as yet, but he was "satisfied" with progress and the talks would resume on Tuesday.   "We discussed very seriously for more than three hours and we adjourned with the decision to meet tomorrow morning again to continue with their (banks') questions and clarifications," Djunic told Reuters. "I am satisfied with the course of the meeting and there will be more details as I hope there will be a press conference tomorrow," he added.   "We expressed willingness to settle the situation with the commercial bank creditors without any political conditions, but purely on a financial basis for everything that we have to repay starting from the IMF, World Bank, Paris Club, London Club and others," Djunic said in a telephone interview after the first day of talks. He declined to give further details on the status of the talks. Technical talks on a possible restructuring or rescheduling of Yugoslavia's London Club debt were last held late in 1996, when sources close to the negotiating team said the talks stumbled over Belgrade presenting an overly optimistic report on the country's economic situation. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7718

GCAT	Mali's President Alpha Oumar Konare will have at least one challenger in the impoverished West African nation's presidential election on May 11, despite opposition calls for a boycott. Konare, who resisted opposition calls for this year's national election timetable to be frozen after chaotic parliamentary polls on April 13, will be up against businessman Mamadou Maribatrou Diaby. Diaby and his Unity, Development and Progress Party (PUDP) have asked their supporters in a statement broadcast on state television to vote in the election, which eight previously declared candidates have decided to boycott. This year's elections, only the second multi-party national polls since independence in 1960, are a test of how deeply democracy has taken root after a widely praised 1992 democratic transition. Konare had been due to face nine challengers on May 4 but put back the date by a week. He launched his campaign on April 29, saying he could not postpone the poll longer than that as the constitution required a newly elected president by June 8. Serious organisational problems disrupted the April 13 elections, during which Malians turned out in force to vote only to be frustrated by lack of ballot papers and problems with voter cards and lists. The constitutional court in the former French colony scrapped the results citing irregularities. No date has been set for a repeat of polling for a new 147-seat parliament. Municipal elections had been planned for June 1. Konare, a historian elected in 1992, has steered the country on a course of economic liberalisation, winning praise from the World Bank and the United States for his efforts. Mali's opposition is grouped mainly in two alliances. The Front for Change and Democracy (FCD) includes dissidents from Konare's ADEMA alliance and politicians portraying themselves as heirs to the tradition of independence leader Modibo Keita, a nationalist and hardline socialist. The Rally of Patriotic Forces (RFP) includes supporters of the former single party and jailed former dictator Moussa Traore, whose 1991 overthrow cleared the way for democratic reforms.
GCAT	Former World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis looks likely to have the chance of regaining his title early in the new year following a court ruling in the United States on Thursday. His manager Frank Maloney said on Friday two possible dates, January 24 and February 1, were being lined up for a re-match with American Oliver McCall, the man who took the title from him in 1994 with a second round knockout. Maloney said Lewis could also have home advantage with London being the likely venue and Atlantic City as an alternative. Attempts to stage the fight have met with a series of delays but on Thursday an American court ruled that promoter Don King, who originally won the right to put on the fight, had failed to stage the event in time. The court awarded the promotion rights to the second highest bidder, Lewis's American promoters Main Events. The title is currently vacant, with Maloney having lost it to Briton Frank Bruno who was then beaten by Mike Tyson who in turn relinquished it. Lewis and McCall will each receive around $2 million for the fight instead of the $3 million under the contract with King, but with the compensation of a possible huge payday in prospect. The winner could be lined up to face Evander Holyfield, shock winner over Tyson last weekend, with purse money of up to $20 million.

GCAT	The House of Representatives is expected to consider on Thursday a resolution to disapprove certification of Mexico as an ally in the war against drugs, House Majority Leader Dick Armey said. Republicans want to "encourage the development of commerce" in Mexico, but "we also want to make it very clear that we cannot have laxity in drug enforcement," Armey said on Tuesday. The House International Relations committee approved the resolution last week that would disapprove President Clinton's certification that Mexico is cooperating fully with the United States in the anti-drug war. "I believe if the legislation were put on the floor as it came out of the committee it would pass ... overwhelmingly," Armey told reporters. "My own desire is to find that magic language that demonstrates to the Mexican government how serious we are about the need for this kind of enforcement, but does not result in behavioral actions by the international financial community that jeopardizes the Mexican economy," Armey, a Texas Republican, said.

GCAT	Italy's Alberto Tomba tumbled out of the top 15 of the World Cup giant slalom rankings on Tuesday and the fall may have seriously hurt his chances of defending his world championship crown. Still battling the flu bug that forced him out of the second leg of the slalom in Chamonix last Sunday, Tomba chose not to race in Adelboden, the final giant slalom before next month's championships in Sestriere. His absence could prove costly. For the first time in a decade, the flamboyant Italian, winner of three Olympic golds including two in the giant slalom, finds himself outside the seeded first 15 skiers and will not have the luxury of drawing his start number at the championships. Hampered by injury and illness, Tomba has not completed a giant slalom this season. In his only race on January 5 in Kranjska Gora he failed to finish, skiing out in the second run. Tomba's inactivity has not only left him rusty but a lowly 21st in the rankings. Before they race for the giant slalom gold on February 12 however, Tomba could move up the rankings and possibly back into the top 15 depending on which skiers are nominated by their countries for the race. For the world championships each country is allowed only four skiers per event. Currently there are seven Austrians ahead of Tomba in the rankings, meaning he could be ranked no worse than 18th. Tomba may also choose not to defend his giant slalom title and concentrate on claiming a second slalom crown instead.
MCAT	The London Metal Exchange (LME) April options declaration went smoothly on Wednesday, as copper and aluminium futures hovered at strikes with modest open interest while lead saw a lump of calls declared. The underlying April contracts in copper and aluminium gravitated towards $2,400 and $1,600 per tonne respectively on Tuesday evening and barely strayed from there by the time options were declared around noon. April copper settled at $2,398 and the options market saw a partial declaration, with about 80 percent of calls and 60 percent of puts declared, traders said. "I think people declared just enough to make them square," one said. But open interest at $2,400 was not very substantial, with 985 lots (equivalent to 24,625 tonnes) of calls and 680 lots (17,000 tonnes) of puts, LME data showed. Implied volatilities were a touch weaker since last week with nearbys bid around 18.00 percent. One dealer said there had been some enquiries on Wednesday morning for upside options in May and further out, but no business had been done. People were interested in selling at-the-money options for the third and fourth quarters, he added. "It's very quiet. There are a few sellers around and we're struggling to find buyers," another trader said. April aluminium futures settled just above $1,600 and options also saw a partial declaration with more calls than puts declared, traders said. Open interest at $1,600 was 1,009 lots (25,225 tonnes) of calls and 616 lots (15,400 tonnes) of puts. Volatilities, like copper, were also slightly soggy, with nearbys bid around 15 percent. April lead edged above the $700 level, settling at around $710 when options were declared. The $700 calls were declared, in which the open interest was fairly large, considering the thinner market, at 490 lots (12,250 tonnes). "I think lead had a bit of a run-up with those $700 positions open," a trader said. Zinc settled just under the $1,300 level and the puts were thought to be declared. Open interest at $1,300 was only 30 lots in calls (750 tonnes) and 75 lots (1,875 tonnes) in puts. But at the same strike level, a large amount of open interest lurks in May calls, 1,458 lots (36,450 tonnes). Scant open interest was seen in nickel and tin. --Eric Onstad, London Newsroom +44 171 542-8065
GCAT	Colombian guerrillas on Monday demanded an army retreat and the presence of observers as conditions to be met before they would release 60 government troops captured in a barracks attack last month. The demands of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) were sent to the media in Mexico City, where the FARC operates an office. The FARC on August 30 launched a raid on the Las Delicias barracks in isolated and jungle-covered Putumayo province in southwestern Colombia as part of a wider offensive that left about 100 dead. About 60 soldiers were taken prisoner by the FARC, although the exact number was unknown. At least 20 people were killed in a fresh round of fighting on Sunday. The FARC communique in Mexico City said the guerrillas were awaiting a public statement from the spokesman of President Ernesto Samper and expecting the army to clear out a wide area around where the soldiers were being held. Colombian media reports said the area was surrounded by the army. "The mothers of the soldiers should be present on the day they are turned over, as should the national and international media," the FARC said. "We have knowledge that the military high command is planning a rescue of the soldiers ... with blood and firepower." The FARC also complained that the government has prohibited envoys from foreign governments into the area in order to mediate.
CCAT	Italian insurer INA said 1996 parent net profit rose 6.4 percent to 421 billion lire and it proposed paying a dividend of 65 lire against the previous year's 55 lire. It said in a statement after a board meeting to approve the 1996 results that pre-tax parent net profit was 837 billion lire, up 12.3 percent on 1995. Net profit per share was 105 lire against 98.8 lire.   INA Chairman Sergio Siglienti, commenting on the 1996 results, said consolidated gross profit should be around one trillion lire, in line with previous estimates of a 20 percent rise over 1995's 812 billion lire. Group net profit in 1995 was 412 billion lire. The board will examine 1996 consolidated results on May 27. Total parent premium income rose to 3.098 trillion lire, a rise of 4.3 percent on 1995. Siglienti said the outstanding 1996 results confirmed INA's position as Italian market leader in the life insurance sector. The insurer said first quarter 1997 results showed a significant rise of some 15 percent in premium income over the same 1996 period. -- Milan newsroom +392 66129589

"We can be assured of a recovery in industrial activity in the second quarter (when) industrial production will grow 4.8 percent year on year," Pique told a press conference. He said the recovery shown in the last industrial survey extended over all subsectors, along with an increase in capacity usage. Production capacity use in the first quarter was 77.4 percent, versus 77.1 percent in the previous three months and 76.1 percent in the first quarter of 1996. Pique said this figure may rise to 80 percent in the next few months.
CCAT	Thai Airways International has switched concentrating its leased freighter on the U.S. market and started a new service to Paris, Thai's cargo director Kawin Asawachatroj told Reuters. Until last month, Thai flew twice a week to Los Angeles and once weekly to Frankfurt with its Boeing 747-200 leased from Atlas Air. With the summer timetable introduction, Thai has now reduced its trans-Pacific service to once weekly and begun a weekly freighter service to Paris as well as continuing its weekly Frankfurt link, Kawin said. Because of aircraft availablity, Thai is also delaying the introduction of a scheduled freighter service between Hong Kong and Bangkok but will increase the number of non-scheduled flights to the territory from this month when the Durian fruit export season gets into full swing. Cathay Pacific is also arranging extra freighter flights from Bangkok to Hong Kong for the Durian season. The distinctive Thai fruit is a traditionally popular delicacy in Hong Kong. Kawin said the changed route pattern should mean Thai should have ground time available to fit in a Hong Kong non-scheduled service to take advantage of a strong export market from Thailand. "We would like to go to various regional destinations but we also have to think about long haul routes. In the short term we won't be starting a scheduled Hong Kong service," Kawin said. Thai is considering how to serve Hong Kong best in the long term that that fits in with the schedule of the carrier's one leased freighter. Thai has plans to operate more than one freighter "but they are still some way off," Kawin said. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 7706 Fax +5017

CCAT	Teck Corp said Tuesday it does not plan to make a bid for Bre-X Minerals Ltd. Teck chief executive Norman Keevil told a conference call that the company is in no rush to spend its strong cash position and that its emphasis would be on new mine development rather than acquisitions. "There won't be any Bre-X...buyout," Keevil said, adding that Teck had made offers to both Bre-X and Arequipa Resources Ltd in their early stages. Arequipa was recently acquired by Barrick Gold Corp.   Bre-X announced last month it was exploring all options to develop its Busang gold deposit in Indonesia including selling a majority stake. Since then, Bre-X stock has tumbled on investor worries about an ownership dispute over the property. Traders have speculated that Teck could be among the major mining companies vying for Bre-X. Keevil said Teck was in its strongest financial position ever thanks to Inco Ltd's takeover of Teck's stake in Diamond Fields Resources Inc, which resulted in a net gain for Teck of C$232 million in the third quarter. Teck had cash and short-term investments of C$457.8 million at September 30. -- Reuters Vancouver Bureau (604) 664-7314
MCAT	Spanish government bonds closed little changed after a stagnant session, with traders remaining on the sidelines awaiting the outcome of today's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington. Although the market has discounted that U.S. rates will remain steady amid mixed signals about the economy, many dealers preferred to hold their fire until the news was confirmed. "We're waiting for the Fed, and above all the Bundesbank after (German) July M3 (money supply) came in lower than expected," said an analyst. The council of the German central bank meets on Thursday to discuss interest rates.
MCAT	Ringgit continued to accumulate losses in late Asian trading on fresh selling by funds and the strong dollar/majors, dealers said on Monday. They said many who had place dollar sell orders on Friday night were seen covering their positions as the strong dollar/majors swamped the market early on Monday. "A lot of people who had initiated shorts were buying back dollars," the head of foreign exchange dealing at a Malaysian bank said. He said there was some dollar selling by corporates and Japanese funds, but that was absorbed by the market.   A Singapore-based U.S. bank dealer said the market was unlikely to move sharply in London as players were cautious ahead of Malaysia's February trade data release on Tuesday. "Unless it is way out of expectations, the ringgit should trade in a wide range," he said. Dealers said if 2.5150 a dollar level was broken, dollar/ringgit could head for 2.5180 or even 2.52. At 1000 GMT, the ringgit was at 2.5136/46 to a dollar. -- Madhav Reddy (603-230 7509)

GCAT	Ernie Els won a nerve-wracking war of attrition at Congressional Country Club on Sunday, overcoming three determined rivals on the final holes to win his second U.S. Open golf championship. The broad-shouldered South African made a string of six successive pressure-packed pars after taking the lead with a birdie at the 12th hole that broke a four-way tie for the lead. Els, who won the 1994 U.S. Open in a three-way playoff at Oakmont Country Club, finished the day with a one-under-par 69 for a winning total of four-under 276. Briton Colin Montgomerie finished second, one stroke back. The burly Scot, who also competed in the Oakmont playoff, was tied with Els until he bogeyed the par-4 17th, missing a five-foot putt for par. Tom Lehman, the reigning British Open champion, was third at two-under. He fell back after posting bogeys at 16 and 17 as he fired at flags in search of a birdie. Jeff Maggert, the last member of the battling quartet, finished poorly after falling behind Els and ended up one over par after being within one shot through 15 holes. "It was great competition out there today. It was really tough," said the 27-year-old Els. "I'm unbelievably delighted." Els earned $465,000 for the victory.
CCAT	Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, chairman of Mexican media conglomerate Grupo Televisa, could step down Tuesday from the post he has held for the last three decades, the daily El Economista said Monday. Televisa and its subsidiary Televicentro will hold "special" meetings both Monday and Tuesday to reassign duties and modify the board structure, the paper said. "(This Monday) there is a meeting of Grupo Televicentro and on Tuesday there is another one for Televisa to designate advisors and revoke powers," an unnamed Televisa director told El Economista.   Azcarraga took a medical leave of absence in mid-February and temporarily left control of the Spanish-speaking world's largest media company and dominant broadcaster in Mexico. Since then, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Emilio Azcarraga Jean, Azcarraga Milmo's son, has been responsible for broadcasting operations and Guillermo Canedo White, executive vice president and chief financial officer, has overseen administrative and corporate affairs.   It is not clear if the shareholder meetings will be held to ratify the responsibilities of Azcarraga Jean and Canedo White, or if Azcarraga Milmo will step down definitively. Spokesmen at Televisa were not immediately available for comment. "Changes in the board will include the chairman himself, the invitation to the meetings and the revoking of powers is because of Azcarraga (Milmo)," the source said.   Manuel Alonso, president of news at Televisa, told Reuters ON February 14 that Azcarraga Milmo would stay on at the helm of Televisa, but that he was unlikely to resume his full work load after returning to Mexico. Azcarraga Milmo took his leave of absence for medical care in Los Angeles, after which he rested in his Los Angeles home. Alonso had said the Televisa chairman planned to rest a "few weeks" before returning to Mexico. El Economista said Azcarraga Milmo would not be present at either of the two board meetings.

GCAT	The Urawa Red Diamonds of Japan's J.League are in contract negotiations with former England captain and Arsenal midfielder David Platt, a team spokesman said on Thursday. "We are in negotiations with Mr. Platt and hope to reach an agreement to enable him to join the team before the July 30 start of the second stage of the 1997 season," the spokesman said by telephone. He declined to discuss possible contract terms or say when the negotiations began. The Red Diamonds, based in the Tokyo suburb of Urawa, were tied for 10th place in the 17-team J.League after the first stage, which ended on Sunday. Platt joined Arsenal for 4.75 million pounds ($7.74 million) from Italy's Sampdoria in 1995. ($1.63=one pound)

ECAT	Rural lobby group Federated Farmers, hurting from the high New Zealand dollar, called on Thursday for government spending restraint to ease inflationary pressures. Federated Farmers President Malcolm Bailey was speaking to reporters at an exporters' summit in Wellington to discuss the sector's difficulties with the strong currency. "There is a problem. We believe that the dollar has climbed too far, too fast, and that that is putting a lot of pressure on the export sector," Bailey said.   "It's impacting quite negatively on farmers' income. We are not seeing farms' input costs coming down like they should be, so we are caught in a bit of squeeze. We are saying the dollar is overvalued." Bailey said the solution was not to "throw out the baby with the bathwater" and make fundamental changes to the Reserve Bank framework, which targets 0-2 percent underlying inflation. "We think inflationary pressures are largely coming from the government sector. We are calling for restraint. We are saying whatever promises were made during the election campaign to increase spending should be set aside," Bailey said.   Bill Gallagher, representing the NZ Manufacturers Federation, said the rate of appreciation in the exchange rate was affecting profitability and investment and would eventually impact on jobs. "The export-led recovery appears to be stalling. It's essential to make the exchange rate lower for the exporters." Gallagher, who is also chief executive of the Hamilton-based Gallagher Group which makes electric fence equipment, said the summit would look at ways of adjusting monetary policy to the business cycle.   Asked if the Reserve Bank should intervene directly in the currency market, Gallagher said: "It's likely to be a short-term fix. Short-term fixes tend to have long-term consequences." Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash, arriving to address the meeting, said he recognised exporters were under "very considerable pressure". -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 473-4746
MCAT	The Indonesian rupiah was stable against the dollar in slow trading on Monday, dealers said. They said volume was a bit thin, with sentiment on the rupiah remaining positive and a further uptrend was expected if no post-election violence emerged in the next few days. Spot rupiah was at 2,430.2/30.7 at 0845 GMT, compared with an opening of 2,431.5/32.0. Tomorrow and today rupiah were at 2,430.5/31.0 and 2,431.1/31.8, respectively. Dealers said liquidity was ample but it had little effect on the rupiah which sustained its positive trend.   Economic analysts said the strengthening of the rupiah reflected the sound fundamentals of the economy. They said traders were concentrating on fundamentals, but the focus in the next few days was on the Moslem-based United Development Party (PPP) meeting this Thursday to decide whether to accept the results of last Thursday's elections. The ruling Golkar won 74 percent and the PPP nearly 23 percent. The PPP claimed there had been widespread irregularities during the polls. Operators were worried over immediate implications for the rupiah if the PPP refused to sign.   "It may be a little bit too early to say all is well and we don't expect further weakness. It's a crucial week, but so far it has been encouraging," one market economist said. "What happens today is a reflection of people coming back to the market after the election," he said. Dealers said liquidity in the money market was a bit tight in the afternoon, with overnight money edging to 10.0 percent from six percent in the morning on local bidding. Overnight swaps were at -0.30/0.25 and tom/next at -0.20/-0.15 points.   One local bank dealer said forward rates eased further on over-borrowing the rupiah earlier. He said ample short-term funds drove forwards lower and was likely to continue. One-month swaps edged down to 11.15/11.50 from 12.25/12.75, two to 23.0/24.75 from 24.5/26.0, three to 35.5/36.0 from 36.0/37.0 and six to 72.75/74.50 from 73.0/76.0 points. The central bank raised its intervention band by one point on Friday to 2,417/2,609 and its conversion band also by one point to 2,417/2,465 on Monday. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
GCAT	Romania's presidential run-off vote on Sunday pits incumbent Ion Iliescu against centrist rival Emil Constantinescu -- two politicians with radically different views of the country's future. Iliescu, in power since the 1989 fall of communism, held a slim lead over Constantinescu in the first round of polls earlier this month, 32 percent to 28 percent. He defeated Constantinescu in the 1992 election. But for the first time in seven years of power, Iliescu looks isolated on the political scene. His leftist Party of Social Democracy, defeated in the parliamentary polls this month, is the only major force backing him for a new term. Here are profiles of the two contenders. ION ILIESCU, 66, President of Romania, is an ex-communist who won power by masterminding the ousting of Stalinist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in the 1989 revolution. He was confirmed as president by a landslide 85 percent in elections in May 1990 and re-elected in September 1992. Moscow-educated Iliescu is the candidate of the leftist Party of Social Democracy, successors of the communists. Iliescu says he offers stability and cautious economic reform to protect Romanians from the pain of change. His opponents say the man who was once heir apparent to Ceausescu is a remnant of an old order mired in corruption. They say he lacks the vision to guide Romania into the next century. Iliescu has moved to the political centre in recent years. But his foes recall the coal miners' riots of 1990 and 1991, which toppled reformist Prime Minister Petre Roman, and say it is evidence of an authoritarian streak. Iliescu, favorite among less educated rural people, won the first round with 32 percent, but was defeated in towns and the capital Bucharest, where his rival led by 17 percentage points. - - - - - EMIL CONSTANTINESCU, 56, is the candidate of the Democratic Convention (CDR), a centrist opposition alliance, which won the country's third parliamentary elections earlier this month. A geologist and law faculty graduate, he rose to political prominence because of his untarnished reputation. Although Constantinescu had little experience of top-level politics and was soundly beaten by Iliescu in 1992 he has grown in self-confidence during the 1996 campaign. Slim, soft-spoken and bearded, he was among teachers who joined students on the streets in the December 1989 revolution. He also joined a protest movement which was bloodily crushed by pro-Iliescu coalminers in June 1990. Constantinescu's American-style "Contract with Romania" promises swifter social, economic and political reforms, guarantees of the rule of law and a fierce attack on corruption and abuse of privilege. Constantinescu got 28 percent of votes in the first round, less than his CDR, which leads in the two parliament houses -- in the lower Chamber of Deputies with 30.17 percent and in the upper house, the Senate, with 30.70 percent.
MCAT	U.S. T-bonds rose in London on Friday in thin holiday business with dealers saying the market was expected to be confined to range for the rest of the session. The benchmark 30-year bond was at 101-07 yielding 6.407 percent at 1054 GMT versus 101-02 at the Tokyo close. New York's closing price on Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday was 100-29. "The market has a positive bias, but should trade for the rest of the day in a pretty tight range," said one trader at a U.S. bank in London. The trader said there was not much interest in the market with so many people still on holiday, and data due on Friday afternoon was unlikely to make much impact. Trading will be abbreviated in New York this session, when the market will close at 1900 GMT. -- October personal income, which is forecast to be unchanged after a 0.6 percent rise in September, and personal spending for October, forecast up 0.3 percent after a 0.1 percent increase the previous month are due at 1330 GMT . -- International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 6176
GCAT	Iraq said on Saturday it had fired missiles at U.S. planes policing no-fly zones -- but missed -- while a newspaper run by President Saddam Hussein's son called for a holy war against the United States. In northern Iraq, Kurdish villagers abandoned their homes ahead of an expected incursion by Turkey's military massing on the border, and Kurdish rebels prepared for further attacks by the combined forces of Iraqi troops and a rival Kurdish faction. "Iraqi air defence men have confronted the hostile (American) aircraft by firing surface-to-air missiles," Iraqi state television said quoting a defence ministry spokesman. It did not say when the missiles were fired. "We have no alternative...but to declare Jihad (holy war) and fight them until the last drop in Iraqis' veins...and strongly reject all their means and commandments," declared Babel, the newspaper of Saddam's eldest son Uday, in a front-page editorial. "We denounce all their latitudes and longitudes. Death is better for us all if our country's territory, waters and people are not united," Babel said, referring to no-fly zones imposed by Washington and its allies over the north and south of Iraq. The Pentagon said that 44 cruise missile strikes, mounted in response to Iraq's military assault against Kurdish rebels in the north last weekend, severely damaged Iraqi air defences in the south last Tuesday and Wednesday, destroying or damaging up to 11 of 15 targets. The United States also expanded the southern no-fly zone from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd, bringing it close to the outskirts of Baghdad. The government newspaper al-Jumhouriya ridiculed U.S. claims that its missile raids had helped reverse the situation in northern Iraq and the main Kurdish city of Arbil, which the Iraqis captured for a pro-Baghdad Kurdish faction last Saturday. "Iraq once again proves that it is the decisive force in Iraqi Kurdistan...the liberation of Arbil marks (the beginning) of the great collapse in U.S. plans against it," the daily said. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), ousted from Arbil last week, said the rival Iraqi-backed Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) had attacked positions in five villages around Halabja, 10 km (six miles) from the Iranian border. The PUK said KDP and Iraqi forces had started to advance from Arbil along the north route towards the PUK stronghold of Sulaimaniya via Degala and the key town of Koi Sanjaq. Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said Turkey might clear some settlements from a narrow "buffer zone" it plans to create along its mountainous and porous border with northern Iraq to prevent infiltrations by separatist Turkish Kurdish rebels using bases there for its 12-year-old insurgency in southeast Turkey. The rebellion has cost over 20,000 lives. Turkish troops have been massing on the border with Iraq in apparent readiness to push against the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), but army officials would not comment on reports that troops had already mounted some cross-border attacks. A foreign ministry official said Ankara wanted to empty some border settlements to ensure civilians were not caught up in fighting and were unable to give refuge or support to the PKK. He did not give any details of the planned operation. Iraqi Kurdish villagers in the border region were already on the move however. Scores of refugees evacuated the area around Banek, about 30 km (20 miles) from the main Iraqi border town of Zakho. They shuttled their belongings to a valley further south, leaving behind fruit and vegetable harvests. "Every year the Turks raid our village. They cut down our fruit trees and bomb our houses, killing our livestock," said Khane Seini, 70, carrying personal belongings on her back. Ciller defended the planned security cordon. "Turkey is determined to protect its own borders," state-run Anatolian news agency quoted her as saying. "This thing called a cordon really constitutes measures just across our border, which are going to prevent entry into our borders." She said any measures would be taken in consultation with Turkey's neighbours and allies. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in London the United States understood Turkey's reasons for establishing a security zone in Iraq and had been assured it would be temporary and involve no permanent troops. But France, Russia and neighbour Syria have opposed the Turkish plan. Iraq has rejected it as "unacceptable." European Union foreign ministers meeting in Tralee, Ireland, glossed over their differences about the U.S. attacks on Iraq. But in opposition to Washington, the ministers called for a reinstatement of the United Nations' oil-for-food deal for Baghdad, suspended last week after Saddam's attacks on the PUK. The ministers emerged from what some EU diplomats said was a tense four-hour meeting, having agreed on a number of points concerning Iraq, but unable to find a common position for the whole 15-nation bloc. Although no formal statement was issued, EU president Ireland said the ministers had strongly condemned Iraq's incursion into the northern safe-haven.
GCAT	Ousted Russian defence minister Igor Rodionov accused President Boris Yeltsin and the government on Friday of destabilising the armed forces by launching "irresponsible" reforms. Rodionov, sacked by Yeltsin in May for failing to make reforms, made his attack two days after Yeltsin signed decrees ordering the reorganisation of the military and reducing troop numbers by 500,000 to 1.2 million by the end of next year. Rodionov denied that a new organisation, set up outside the armed forces to defend the military's interests, would destabilise the army. He is a member of the organisation. "The president and prime minister's political approach to the problem (of military reform) destabilises the situation," he said in an interview published by Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper. "I cannot understand why our leadership is so irresponsible about military reforms. We still have no doctrine, no concept, no programme and, that means, no everyday plans." The armed forces, heavily funded in Soviet times, are now demoralised and in disarray. They were defeated by separatist rebels in Chechnya, many soldiers have not been paid for months, corruption is rife and living conditions are getting worse. Nezavisimaya Gazeta published the interview with Rodionov alongside an article written by the former defence minister in which he appealed to servicemen to be patient. "Ninety-five thousand officers do not have their own place to live. Many live in very difficult conditions -- in railway carriages, garages, tents, their workplaces. It make you ashamed and bitter to acknowledge and see this," he said. Rodionov said Yeltsin was wrong to make military reforms subordinate to overall economic reforms. "Strengthening the economy at the expense of the country's military readiness is adventurism," he wrote. Yeltsin's decrees also ordered the merger of various branches of the armed forces and put restrictions on defence ministry and general staff administration costs. He instructed Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's government to come up with proposals for funding the changes and providing help for servicemen who are discharged.
ECAT	Dade Coutny, Fla., could see an $80 million cash reserve carryover suplus for fiscal year 1996, which ended Sept 30, county officials said Tuesday. A combination of increased property tax revenues and increased property tax values as well a reduced spending in some areas contributed to the projected surplus, said Alex Penelas, Metroplitan Dade County executive mayor, in an interview with Reuters here. The final tally will be known when the county makes its mid-year budget adjustment for fiscal 1997 in the next few weeks, Penelas said.   Penelas, elected to the newly created position Oct 1,  is in New York City to meet with the media, tourism groups, bond raters and investors to discuss Dade County's new government structure as well as Miami's fiscal problems. The county has sold almost $600 million in debt in recent months, including a $437 million water and sewer bond issue. The county debt is rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc and A-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp. Penelas noted that while Miami is an integral part of Dade County, its fiscal problems have not adversely affected the county's overall financial stability. The biggest challenge facing Dade County is the welfare program and how to deal with about 40,000 people coming off the welfare rolls as federal reforms begin to take effect, Penelas said. --U.S. Municipal Desk, 212-859-1650

GCAT	France flew fresh troops into the Congolese capital Brazzaville on Monday and airlifted more than 350 foreign nationals out of the city, where rival political and ethnic militias fought for a fifth successive day. Bodies of dead fighters and civilians killed in crossfire lay untouched on the streets where they had been shot. Western military sources said there seemed to have been a slight decrease in the level of combat, but both small arms and mortar fire continued in different parts of the city. "The positions of the two forces are roughly where they were on Thursday, with each side holding part of the city," one said. Fugitives from the pre-election fighting say it appears to be more widespread than in 1993, when 2,000 people were killed in clashes between political and ethnic militias in the capital following disputed parliamentary elections. French troops evacuated foreigners to their military base and four French military Transall planes left the city carrying about 90 people in each and heading for Libreville in Gabon. Diplomats said around 300 French and other foreign nationals were waiting to be evacuated at two hotels in Brazzaville. A new contingent of 150 French troops arrived in the former French colony's capital on Monday to join 450 already there. The French defence ministry said it was increasing to 800 the number of troops it was sending -- up from 500 initially planned. A spokeswoman said 400 soldiers were flying from mainland France and another 400 from Chad. "We'll have 1,200 men on the ground tomorrow," she said. Fighting in the run-up to a July 27 presidential poll pits soldiers loyal to President Pascal Lissouba and their militia allies against ex-president Denis Sassou Nguesso's political militia. Lissouba's government accused Sassou Nguesso on Sunday of trying to stage a coup. Sassou Nguesso pleads self-defence. He says Lissouba fomented the violence to postpone the election. Sassou Nguesso told Reuters by telephone he remained open to dialogue but not with Lissouba accusing him of staging a coup attempt. "I am open to all negotiations, but I reject negotiations on an erroneous basis," he said. Sassou Nguesso said he had respected a night truce at the request of Bernard Kolelas, Brazzaville's mayor and head of a committee trying to mediate. "We saw that Lissouba's militias were not respecting the ceasefire, so we responded," he added. Sassou Nguesso said his forces controlled the northern suburbs and part of the city centre and would do all they could to help France evacuate foreign nationals. In the Bacongo district, the fiefdom of Kolelas's militia, which has so far been neutral in the fighting, witnesses said a shell had landed killing one person. One shell landed across the Congo River in Kinshasa, capital of Laurent Kabila's Democratic Republic of the Congo, exploding in the garden of a Nigerian diplomat. There were no injuries and minimal damage, witnesses said. France's decision to send more troops followed the Saturday death of a French soldier in a firefight and reports from French nationals who fled the city of hostility towards them there. South African oil and chemicals company Sasol Ltd said it had evacuated its four staff because of the violence. There was no clear idea of numbers of dead or wounded. Clashes began on Thursday after soldiers enforcing a ban on private militias surrounded Sassou Nguesso's house. Sassou Nguesso, a former Marxist military leader, was named president in 1979 but voted out of office in 1992 after the advent of democratic reform. Kolelas was runner-up to Lissouba.
MCAT	Gold prices traded in a narrow range on Monday in a market disappointed by the metal's failure to hold onto last week's rally gains. Platinum prices slumped to fresh three-year lows, while silver ticked slightly higher as U.S. traders covered short positions, dealers said. Gold was fixed slightly higher at $369.00, compared to $368.50 in the morning, although dealers said the market was cautiously bearish. "The market is a little shell-shocked after Friday. Everyone's watching the stock market as people are very much undecided what to do next," a dealer said. Prices had rallied on Friday as speculators anticipated a move of "hot" money on comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. But values turned lower from a high around $375 an ounce as financial markets regained confidence. "It's very disappointing that all the markets turned around after a real burst to the upside on Friday, especially gold, which has really given up the ghost," said another. In other markets, the U.S. dollar was higher and equities and bonds were firmer after key finance officials said Friday's global market nosedive was excessive. Silver ticked up some five cents from early Monday levels to $4.80/$4.82 an ounce, unchanged from Friday's London close. "There was some localised shortcovering from American market makers and a bit of fund buying," a dealer said. Platinum, which was hit by a bout of selling on Friday and continued to show signs of weakness, was trading at a small discount to gold. It was indicated at $368.00/$369.00 an ounce, after fixing below the $370 level for the first time since December 1, 1993. "There's been some two-way business today, with industrial demand and some fund and speculative selling," a dealer said. Platinum's decline was probably due to investment funds liquidating long platinum positions that had been held in a play on the gold-platinum spread, another said. Several dealers dismissed suggestions that sales by major producer Russia might be responsible for the decline. A senior Russian trade official in Tokyo noted early on Monday that Russia may be selling some platinum in Europe in a bid to fill export quotas approved for this year. Palladium was indicated up $1.00 at $116.50/$117.50. --Lida Poletz, London newsroom +44 171 542 2936
MCAT	Early trade on the IPE natural gas contract was confined to the fourth quarter on Friday, with the direction of trade mixed.

ECAT	The International Monetary Fund said on Friday that its executive board had authorised Vietnam to draw another tranche of about $88 million in soft loans after giving an upbeat appraisal of its economic policies. The IMF's Resident Representative in Vietnam, Michael Bell, said the authorisation came after a review of the second annual arrangement under the IMF's concessional Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). ESAFs are funds loaned by the IMF at low rates to low-income countries in return for a pledge to undertake strong policy steps, usually aimed at redressing balance of payments problems. The IMF approved a three-year six-tranche ESAF of about $530 million for Vietnam in November 1994, when it was clear that eight years of reform had already brought spectacular gains. Bell said in a statement the latest credit would bring IMF disbursements since October 1993 to well over $500 million and noted that a further two tranches of $176 million would be available in 1997 under the third and final year of the ESAF deal. He said the executive board carried out its annual review of economic policy against a background of strong growth -- an annual rate of nine percent -- and an inflation rate of less than four percent. The board said a recent widening of the external current account deficit largely reflected strong inflows of foreign direct investment. But it said external financing was sufficient and the country's international reserves had increased. "These economic conditions reflect the authorities' basically sound fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies and provide an opportunity to press ahead with essential structural reforms," he said. He said that in recent months the authorities had taken a number of reform steps, especially in the areas of state enterprises, the financial system and the foreign payments system. Donor nations and agencies are due to gather at a World Bank-chaired meeting in Hanoi next week to consider aid pledges for next year. Official media have reported that Hanoi expects pledges worth $2.8 billion at the meeting. But diplomats have said the figure was likely to be about the same as last year. Aid commitments came to $2.31 billion last year, a rise from $1.9 billion in 1994 and $1.8 billion a year earlier.

GCAT	Jim Furyk birdied the 18th hole on Thursday to grab a one shot lead in the suspended first round of the $1.8 million Byron Nelson Classic golf tournament. Furyk's eighth birdie of the round allowed him to finish at 7-under-par 63, one shot better than three golfers, including Masters champion Tiger Woods. Woods, playing for the first time since his victory at Augusta, was tied for second place with Dudley Hart and Paul Stankowski. Woods was looking for his third win of the year and Stankowski his second. Play was delayed by lightning for three hours, 40 minutes, but all but three players completed their rounds before play was suspended. Four straight birdies from holes seven through 10 highlighted Furyk's round. After a pair of six-foot putts on the seventh and eighth, he rolled in a 15-footer on the par-3 ninth hole to finish the front nine at 4-under 30.  He opened the back side with an eightfooter on the 10th hole. "I jumped right into the flow today," Furyk said.  "It's nice to get off to a good start." Furyk, playing the Cottonwood Valley Course, added back-to-back birdies on 12 and 13 before his only bogey of the round on the 14th. His other birdie of the round was at the second hole. The bigger crowds were at the Tournament Players Course, where Woods started fast, with a birdie on the first hole before four straight birdies beginning at the fifth hole.  He carded a 30 on the front side. "I was just hoping for a round under par -- I was pretty nervous," he said. "It was nice to feel the juices flowing. The front nine was more than I could have hoped for." But after nailing a 30-footer for birdie on 10, Woods bogeyed 11 and 12 to fall back to 4-under.  He recovered with birdies on the 16th and 18th holes. Stankowski, who beat Furyk in a playoff to win the Hawaiian Open in February, matched Woods at the Tournament Course, birdying the first two holes and five of the first nine. He added a pair of birdies and a bogey on the back side. Tom Watson, the last Tour player to win the same event three straight years when he won here from 1978-80, was among a group of six golfers at 5-under 65. Ten golfers are three shots back with 66s, including defending champion Phil Mickelson, Nick Faldo and Ben Crenshaw.
CCAT	Reaching into his past to help guide Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. through a crisis, new chairman and chief executive Dr. Thomas Frist on Monday named Jack Bovender president and chief operating officer of the embattled hospital firm. Bovender was Frist's head of operations at Hospital Corp. of America, or HCA, which Frist co-founded with his father in 1968 and then sold to Columbia three years ago. Bovender, 51, will assume his new job immediately, Frist said. "Jack's three decades of work in the industry, along with his commitment to the value-based corporate culture we intend to institutionalize throughout Columbia/HCA, make him the right choice," Frist said in a statement. Nashville, Tenn.-based Columbia is reeling from a massive federal investigation that led to the indictments last week of three company executives on fraud charges and the ouster on July 24 of long-time chief executive Richard Scott. Frist, 58, who had been Columbia's vice chairman, replaced Scott. Bovender will replace David Vandewater, who resigned along with Scott under pressure from Columbia's board. "I am committed to operating this company in a manner that promotes the highest moral and ethical standards," Bovender said in a statement. "Our management team pledges its total cooperation with the federal government, all state governments and all other concerned parties in resolving past issues." Separately, two U.S. consumer groups Monday called on the attorneys general of all 50 states to impose a moratorium on acquisitions of non-profit hospitals by Columbia and Tenet Healthcare Corp., respectively, the largest and second-largest U.S. for-profit hospital companies. Consumers Union's West Coast Regional Office and Community Catalyst, of Boston, said they "urged that the moratorium be imposed pending resolution of all federal and state investigations involving these two companies." In addition to several federal agencies, state attorneys general in Texas and Alabama and one private law firm working with private insurers are investigating Columbia. Eleven shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the company in Tennessee and Delaware, alleging a litany of corporate abuses. The company's stock regained some ground Monday, closing up 31.25 cents to $33.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. It has fallen sharply from more than $40 a share in mid-July, when dozens of federal agents seized laboratory billing and home health care files from 33 Columbia facilities in six states as part of the investigation. Tenet, based in Santa Barbara, Calif., had been rumored to be in merger discussions with Columbia, even as the Columbia investigation was going on. But those rumors have been squelched in recent days under the weight of controversy facing both companies, analysts said. Tenet said last week it had reached an agreement to settle 700 lawsuits brought by former patients who claimed they were admitted to Tenet psychiatric hospitals without cause or were held against their will. The company did not disclose the dollar value of the settlement agreement. "The public needs and has a right to know about the kind of corporate citizens who are moving into their communities. With regard to Columbia and Tenet, there is still a big question mark," Julio Mateo, a lawyer with Consumers Union in San Francisco, said in a statement. Consumers Union publishes Consumer Reports magazine.
GCAT	The Australian winner of the 1996 Nobel Medicine Prize said on Monday he was elated by the recognition for a breakthrough in immunology that he and a Swiss colleague made 23 years ago. "It's a fantastic feeling...I'm still in a state of shock. It is a tremendous recognition," Peter Doherty told Reuters in a telephone interview from his home in Memphis. "It wasn't totally unexpected," he added, though. Doherty, 55, shared the prize with Rolf Zinkernagel, 52, of the University of Zurich, for discoveries made while working in Australia on how the immune system detects virus-infected cells, Sweden's Karolinska Institute said. The two men will share $1.12 million as their prize. Doherty, who now works at a cancer hospital for children in the United States, said the discovery of the basic principle of how the killer T-cell works was made in 1973 and has since mushroomed into an enormous field in immunology. "It was a major discovery. It was completely new, something nobody suspected," he said. "It triggered a new direction in research. It targeted a whole new way of looking at the problem and this was not understood immediately," said Doherty, who is now chairman of the Department of Immunology at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. He said the discovery brought about a new way of understanding how viruses should be controlled and how to make vaccines. Doherty has lived for eight years in Memphis, where he is also a professor at the University of Tennessee's College of Medicine. Doherty began his career as a veterinary officer at Brisbane's Animal Research Institute after attending universities in the Australian state of Queensland and Edinburgh, Scotland. The Karolinska Institute in Stockholm said the work of Zinkernagel and Doherty at the John Curtin School of Medical Research in Canberra from 1973 to 1975 had been crucial for understanding how the human body recognised viruses. The scientists used mice to study how the immune system and particularly T-lymphocytes -- which protect the body against infection -- protected animals. Infected mice developed "killer lymphocytes," which in a test tube could kill cells that had been infected with a virus. The two men made another unexpected discovery -- that the lymphocytes were only active against a specific virus in a specific mouse and would not protect a different animal. Doherty said he worked in the United States because it was the world leader in bio-medical research thanks to the "tremendous support" in funding given by the U.S. government. The Nobel prize will likely distract him from his scientific work for a while. "This probably means I won't get much work done in the next 12 months," he said.

CCAT	Swedish insurance company Trygg-Hansa AB's cooperation with Swedish mutual life company Forenade Liv on group insurance policies will provide a good springboard for growth, mainly through new group products, according to the two companies. The companies also hope to take market shares of traditional sectors, Trygg-Hansa spokesman Mats Hoglund said. "We work today with life and health insurance. We think that we can work with other areas like home insurance and security insurance," Hoglund said. "When looking at non-life insurance, we cover 15-20 percent of the market, while we are clearly bigger on group life insurances," he said. "It's not impossible for an upturn of 50 percent on non-life insurance for the groups available today. "In addition, we, of course, want to take market shares in the traditional areas." Hoglund points to social security insurances as a market that can be penetrated through group insurances. "One example is dental insurance," he said. "If you have individual insurances, we have to check everybody's teeth, but group insurances mean a more efficient way of setting prices. "On the pension side, you could play with the idea that 100,000 people save 500 crowns a month -- that's a lot of money," he said. The president of Forenade Liv, Kjell-Ake Persson, also sees large growth potential for group insurances in the future. The new joint venture on sales and administration with Trygg-Hansa, announced on Tuesday, gives further possibilities for growth, according to Persson. "Most Swedes are members of associations where a group insurance solution is possible," Persson told Reuters. "These can be unions, companies or interest groups and I'm convinced that group insurances will grow sharply." According to Persson, the total premium income from group insurances was 3.3 billion crowns in 1995. Of the total, group life insurance amounted to about 3.1 billion crowns and group health care insurers for 200 million crowns. Persson sees a very large growth ahead, mainly on the group health care side. "Group health care insurances have, despite the low total figures, showed sharp growth during the past years," he said. "As long as the sick leave pay was 90 percent, there was no room for group health care insurances, but now the market looks completely different." The new company's aim is to attempt to make group solutions for most insurance products. "As new needs occur, we, along with Trygg-Hansa's products, are able to meet them," Persson said. -- Jorgen Osterberg, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1008
ECAT	The Cahners Business Confidence Index (CBCI) rose to 67.4 in August from 65.3 in July, according to a report by Cahners Economics. "Business confidence has responded favorably to the likelihood the Fed will remain on the sidelines for several months to come," the report said. Sixty-nine percent of the 400 manufacturers surveyed rated current business conditions as "good/excellent." Four of seven CBCI components rose in August. The employment portion climbed farthest, gaining 2.7 points to stand at 67.5.   Readings of inventories, production and marketing spending increased in August as well. Of the three individual indices that fell, capital spending turned in the greatest decline, slipping 2.2 percent to 75.2 in August. More than 60 percent of respondents said policies aimed at economic growth should be the presidential candidates' first economic priority, the report said. Fewer than 20 percent of respondents said controlling inflation should be first priority, it said. The CBCI is computed monthly from a telephone survey of 400 senior and mid-level managers in the manufacturing sector. --Scott Gerlach, 212-859-1868

GCAT	Feeding off tinder-dry pines, a forest fire broke out in this Atlantic County township in southern New Jersey, forcing police officers to evacuate 100 homes in a development called Totem Village. "The fires has taken out 1,000 acres plus. We have no control and no containment," said Sam Moore, a field officer for the state Forest Fire Service. The fire broke out at about 4:30 p.m. EDT in the Wharton State Forest and by sunset had tripled in size. The plume of smoke could be seen for 30 to 40 miles, as far away as Philadelphia and Trenton. No injuries or property damage were reported. It was the second major fire in as many weeks in the vast scrub forest called the Pine Barrens -- much of it a state wildlife preserve. On July 19, flames destroyed 800 acres but spared two retirement communities in Ocean County.
GCAT	Serbia plans talks with ethnic Albanians to calm tensions in the province of Kosovo which have been overshadowed by opposition demonstrations elsewhere in the republic, political sources say. The independent Belgrade newspaper Dnevni Telegraf said Serbian officials and Albanian leaders had discussed implementation of an education agreement in the Albanian-majority province which was signed in September 1 year but not put into effect. Serbian officials refused to deny or confirm the meeting would go ahead. But political sources in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, said the talks were expected to resume urgently despite the instability elsewhere in Serbia caused by the annulment of opposition victories in municipal elections. In 1989, Serbia abolished Kosovo's autonomous status, charging that its Albanians, outnumbering Serbs nine to one, were preparing to secede. Serbs regard Kosovo as the ancient cradle of their culture. Since 1989 the Albanians have been quietly dissenting in the impoverished, rocky southern region. They have peacefully boycotting Serbian authority and pushed for greater self-rule. A solution of the Kosovo problem was sidetracked for years by efforts to end the devastating war in Bosnia. When the Dayton peace treaty held in Bosnia, the spotlight moved back to Kosovo. "The international community has explicitly warned the Albanians that Yugoslavia's internal and external borders cannot be changed. This has helped us as well as them to shed their illusions," said Bosko Drobnjak, a senior Serb official. "However, an atmosphere for dialogue created last year was not welcomed by hardliners. This resulted in terrorism." Both Serbs and Albanians say that 15 Serbs and 14 Albanians were killed in clashes in Kosovo in 1996 -- more deaths by ethnic violence than in Bosnia's first postwar year. The latest target was the radical Serb rector of Pristina University, Radivoje Papovic, who opposed the education deal Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic struck last September with Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. The agreement, under which Albanian students would return to schools after boycotting them six years, was described as historic but never got off the ground because of delays blamed by each side on the other. "We welcomed the deal with profound relief. We believe it was the most delicate problem of all," Drobnjak told Reuters. "We favour a step-by-step approach to solving the dispute. We must abandon our entrenched positions and compromise. "But if all we keep hearing from the Albanians is "We want independent Kosovo' then all dialogue is senseless." "Albanians will never again at any cost accept living under Serbia's rule even if they get autonomy," said Blerim Shala, editor of the leading Albanian weekly Zeri. Albanian parties, Rugova's LDK and the Parliamentary Party (PP) led by Adem Demaqi who spent 28 years in old Yugoslavia's jails as a political prisoner, urge Kosovo's independence. Where Rugova advocates peaceful means to achieve his goal Demaqi wants to radicalise the drive for a break from Serbia. Paradoxally, Demaqi is more moderate in his final goal -- a Republic of Kosovo within Yugoslavia. But LDK vice-president Fehmni Agani told Reuters the LDK could accept a Kosovo republic as a compromise solution. Their hopes were boosted by the international High Representative in Bosnia, Carl Bildt, who urged Albanians' demands for their own republic within Yugoslavia to be met. But all agree that neither Milosevic nor the Albanians could put such a proposal forward. "It is the international community which must slap the deal down at the table like in Dayton," Shala said. Western diplomats say that by granting the Albanians their republic Milosevic would solve many of his problems with the Serbian opposition coalition Zajedno (Together) which has been protesting on the streets for 75 days against the election annulments. "This would allow Milosevic to become the president of a new Yugoslavia and amend the constitution, giving him greater powers which grateful Albanians would gladly endorse," a senior Western diplomat said. "This would also enable him to regain his standing in the international community which will forget the mess he made with Zajedno in one stroke."
MCAT	U.S. stocks may face a period of volatile, range-bound trading after their rally from April lows, Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chair of Goldman Sachs and Co's investment policy committee, said on Monday. In a research report, Cohen wrote that Wall Street stocks typically move in a pattern in which large increases are followed by extended, and sometimes volatile, trading ranges. "The price increases enjoyed since April would certainly qualify as a quantum upward step," she said in the report. "A period of digestion may now be under way."   The Dow had risen 1,405 points from its 1997 closing low on April 11 at 6391.69 through its record closing on Friday at 7796.51, a 22 percent jump. On Monday comments by Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto about the potential sale by Japan of U.S. government securities triggered a wave of selling in U.S. stocks. The Dow ended off 192.25 points, or 2.5 percent, at 7604.26. Cohen said the S&P 500 now trades at about 19 times Goldman's 1997 estimate for the stock group's operating earnings and 17.5 times its 1998 estimate. "If these multiples are maintained, we'd expect the S&P 500 to reach at least 950 by mid-year 1998," she said. "The rough equivalent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average would be 8250." The S&P 500 on Monday finished off 20.08 points, or 2.2 percent, at 878.62. ((--Wall St Desk, 212-859-1730))

ECAT	U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday launched a push for legislation that would give him authority to negotiate trade pacts, including a deal to bring Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement. Clinton named Recording Industry Association of America Chairman Jason Berman to head the administration's effort to win passage in Congress of the so-called fast track trade negotiation legislation. "Every president, Republican and Democrat, in the past two decades has had this vital tool to maintain effective American leaderhip in the global economy," Clinton said in a statement announcing Berman's appointment. "I am calling on Congress to enact fast-track legislation so we can continue our aggressive drive to open markets to our goods and services and create more high skilled jobs for the American people," he added. The president met with Democratic members of the House of Representatives to discuss plans to get the legislation passed. "It was a very open exchange both on the substance of fast track, on trade issues, on the politics of it, so it was a very positive, good meeting," Secretary of Commerce William Daley said after the meeting. Clinton has yet to send Congress -- controlled by Republicans -- proposed legislation on the fast track authority, which would allow U.S. officials to negotiate trade agreements without fear they will later be changed. Under fast track, lawmakers give up their right to amend trade agreements and would only vote for or against them. Daley, who led the administration's effort to win Congressional passage of NAFTA in 1993, said it would help the administration to have Berman "totally focused" on getting the fast track legislation through Congress. "There is an advantage in this sort of fight to bring in somebody who, for a very short period of two and half or three months, is totally focused on an issue that will be very difficult and pulling all the different pieces together," Daley said. Berman has been with the Recording Industry Association of America since 1987 and has played a role in the U.S. effort to reduce piracy of sound recordings and open markets to legitimate products around the world, the trade group said. The administration has been without fast track trade negotiation authority since 1994. Trade advocates in Congress and the business community want it to propose legislation and get it through Congress. They fear that, without it, U.S. companies would lose market opportunities in Latin America to European and Japanese competitors. The White House decided to wait until September before proposing legislation because officials wanted to wait until most of the work with Congress on a balance budget agreement and tax cuts was completed. The legislation has also been delayed by a dispute between Democrats and Republicans over whether labour and environmental issues should be included in trade negotiations. The fast track authority is needed for U.S. officials to negotiate expansion of NAFTA to include Chile, with which NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico have separate trade agreements. Fast track would also allow U.S. officials to push ahead with negotiations to create a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas by 2005. And it is needed for a global round of negotiations on agriculture trade set to start in 1999.

Flopped when hot favourite last year.Trainer: Gordon Richards Jockey: Richard Dunwoody Odds: 10-1 Strengths. Arguably the best chaser in Britain after winning the King George VI chase at Kempton in December for the second time in succession. Weaknesses: Big disappointment in last year's Gold Cup, prompting suggestion he neither likes the track nor the distance.

CCAT	Hubei Sanonda Co Ltd's 100 million B share issue debuted on the Shenzhen stock exchange on Thursday at HK$6.00, up HK$2.52 or 72.41 percent, but analysts said they expected it to surrender some of the gains later in the day.   "I am not sure if this is a fair value for the stock judging by the volatile market sentiment," an analyst at China Guotai Securities said. Analysts said they expected Sanonda's foreign currency B shares to slip back to between HK$4.00 and HK$5.00 in the short term against the issue price of HK$3.48. The pesticide maker's B share issue last month was 10 times oversubscribed, analysts said. The offer carried a price/earnings ratio of 8.78 times based on forecast 1997 net profits on a fully diluted basis under international accounting standards. Profits after tax but before exceptional items are expected to be more than 114 million yuan in 1997, the company has said.
CCAT	Taiwan's Formosa Chemical & Fibre Corp said on Thursday it would issue T$4 billion in seven-year unsecured corporate bonds to help finance its parent Formosa Group's US$9 billion naphtha cracker project.

The bonds would bear a coupon rate of about 6.54 percent, he added. Formosa Plastics Corp launched its US$9 billion sixth naphtha cracker project in 1993 in central Taiwan.   Construction of the complex, including a naphtha cracker and oil refinery, will take six years to complete. Formosa Group has three key members -- Formosa Plastics, Nan Ya Plastics and Formosa Chemical & Fibre. -- Taipei Newsroom (5080815)
CCAT	Bank of Western Australia Ltd said on Wednesday it may not be able to sustain the level of profits achieved in the year to February 28, 1997 due to intense competition, lower lending rates and restructuring costs.   BankWest, 51.47 percent owned by the Bank of Scotland, earlier announced an A$94.5 million profit for the year to end-February compared with its prospectus forecast of a profit of A$100.2 million. The bank warned in February that results were likely to be five percent below the forecast. BankWest chairman Ian Mackenzie said in a statement accompanying its results that the banking industry would be characterised by rapid change and continued intense competition. "The bank is focussed on achieving improved operating efficency and on growing revenue to compensate for the pressure on interest margin," Mackenzie said.   "Nevertheless, recent cuts in lending rates will have their full effect in the current financial year and restructuring costs also will be incurred," he said. The impact would be felt particularly in the first half, he said. "In the circumstances, the bank might not be able to sustain the level of profits achieved in the year under review."   The interest margin narrowed to 3.1 percent compared with the prospectus forecast of 3.3 percent, and 3.4 percent in the year ended September 1995. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

MCAT	U.S. West Coast crude prices added to early gains by 15 cents, but differentials for Alaska North Slope (ANS) stayed the same as traders failed to strike fixed deals. The West Coast market stayed quiet on Thursday, with players leaving businesses to attend a golf tournament, traders said. The discount for ANS remained $2.30 off November West Texas Intermediate (WTI). Recent strength in crude and weak margins soured them on current offers. Traders saw no effect from a fire at a Shell gasoline distribution terminal in Los Angeles.   Meanwhile, weak margins could force Ultramar to cut runs at its Wilmington, Calif., plant starting in late October. Ultramar said it refused to buy an ANS cargo for November, which would trim its crude input 12,000 barrels-per-day. Tosco Corp was also considering run cuts at its California refineries, traders said. Outright ANS prices rose 15 cents to $22.95/23.25 a barrel, in line with WTI. Bellwether WTI gained on supportive data from Thursday's Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, which showed crude inventories fell 3.3 million barrels last week compared to the API's 417,000 barrels.   Buyers claimed the Ecuadorian government's decision to cut prices for Oriente crude on Thursday would put pressure on ANS. The South American crude competes with ANS out West. Line 63 diffs remained unchanged at $3.20 to $3.00 under spot WTI for November delivery. ARCO will announce November shipping restrictions for the line next week, traders said. California heavy crudes remained flat. Kern River crude was $17.30/17.50 a barrel. Values for Wilmington crude stayed at $18.65/18.75 a barrel. -- David Brinkerhoff, Los Angeles bureau, +1 213 380 2014
GCAT	Olympic gold medallist Carl Lewis has told organisers of a prize-giving ceremony in Spain he will not be able to attend because he has lost his passport, an official said on Friday. "As I was getting ready to board the airplane in New York I discovered that I had lost my passport," Lewis told the Prince of Asturias foundation in a fax sent on Friday. The state department did not authorise him to board the plane, the athlete added. Lewis said he deeply regretted not being able to collect the award, which meant a lot to him because it recognised not only his sporting achievements but also his fight against drugs in sport. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and former Spanish prime minister Adolfo Suarez will be among those attending the annual awards ceremony in the northern city of Oviedo on Friday night. Kohl has been awarded the foundation's international co-operation prize for his role in reducing arms in Europe in the 1980s, reunifying Germany and promoting European economic and monetary union. The Prince of Asturias prize was founded in 1980 and named after the Spanish royal heir. Winners receive a statue by Catalan artist Joan Miro, a certificate and a cash prize. Past winners include King Hussein of Jordan who won the Prince of Asturias peace prize in 1995. Slain Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin shared the same prize with Palestinian President (then PLO chairman) Yasser Arafat the previous year.
ECAT	The National Bank of Ethiopia (central bank) said on Thursday it sold some $1 billion at currency auctions to cover imports in the 1996/97 (July/June) fiscal year compared to $697.6 million in 1995/96. The central bank said private businesses purchased $917.6 million in hard currency while the balance of $82.4 million went to state-owned firms financed by the government budget and their own funding. The money was used to import machinery, manufactured goods and other consumer products. The bank said it was satisfied the purchased money was put to proper use. "The bank has been monitoring whether the auctioned money was used for the purpose intended, and there was no problem encountered," the bank said, in comments to the state-run Ethiopia News Agency (ENA).

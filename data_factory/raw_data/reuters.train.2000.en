MCAT	Israel's bonds closed up on Wednesday despite the disappointment caused by the small interest rate cut on Tuesday, traders said. Arab violence over Israel's opening of a tunnel under the Old City of Jerusalem did not affect the market. Indices: * Government bonds general: +0.2 pct to 165.67 * Consumer price index (CPI) linked government bonds: +0.2 pct to 166.73 * Dollar linked government bonds: -0.2 pct to 161.81 * Unlinked government bonds (Gilon - issued for 4 years): unchanged at 164.52 * Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: unchanged at 156.68 "There was strong demand for CPI-linked bonds, trading in unlinked bonds was mixed and there was surplus supply for dollar linked bonds," said Adam Reuter, managing director of Financial Immunities, a financial and economic consultancy. "All in all the market reacted negatively to the low interest rate cut and the market would have risen much more had the cut been greater," he said. On Tuesday the central bank said it was lowering its key lending rate for October by 0.3 percent to an annualised 15.5 percent. "The bond market has been going up for the past few weeks manily because there are fewer redemptions from provident funds and because the central bank's security net for the bonds has helped calm the market," he said. Israel's low stock and bond prices have affected the performance of provident funds, long term savings funds with special tax benefits, triggering public redemptions. Provident funds, major investors in the bond market, have been dumping bonds to meet the massive redemptions. To stop the falling prices in the bond market, the central bank has intervened in the bond market by buying government bonds. Most of the falling prices were in CPI-linked bonds. Danny Alt, of Nassua Trading and Investment in Securities Ltd, said the rise in prices in CPI-linked bonds was due mainly to lower provident fund redemptions and to the fact that the Treasury had practically stopped issuing CPI-linked bonds and was issuing mainly unlinked bonds. "The central bank issued unlinked bonds today worth 500 million shekels for the Treasury. Despite the big issue the bonds are performing well," he said. Both Reuter and Alt said that political unrest in Jerusalem, over the opening of a tunnel in the Old City, had not affected trading. Note: The Bank of Israel short term Makam bills are debt certificates issued for periods ranging from three months to one year. The bills are zero-coupon, unlinked short-term notes. The Bank of Israel issues the certificates which are used as a monetary instrument, to absorb money from the public. ($1 = 3.17 shekels) Shoshanna Solomon, Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
GCAT	British Defence Secretary Michael Portillo ruled out an early IRA truce on Tuesday and said security had been tightened across Northern Ireland against a threat of further guerrilla attacks. "I am afraid there is no sign of any IRA ceasefire," Portillo said in Lisburn, south of Belfast, at British Army headquarters which the Irish Republican Army (IRA) bombed last month, killing a soldier and wounding 30 soldiers and civilians. Portillo said security forces were on the front line of a campaign that the extremists re-started last February after a 17 month lull in their 27 year battle to end British rule. Security chiefs in London and Belfast warned recently that the IRA might strike at any moment despite intensive political efforts to get the group to declare a truce that would give a seat in peace talks to its Sinn Fein political arm. Britain and Ireland say that Sinn Fein will not be admitted to five-month-old multi-party discussions in Belfast until the IRA declares an end to its war to unite the partitioned island. "It seems clear that the IRA has the security forces in their targets. We therefore have to be extremely alert," Portillo told reporters. The IRA's ability to breach security at the base and detonate two big car bombs had been a cause of concern, he said. "In the days since that bombing, measures have been taken across the province...Everything possible to improve security has been done. We have to remain alert however to what is a very determined and very violent foe." Portillo, making what was described as a "routine visit" to troops stationed in Lisburn and other areas of the province, said current political talks held the key to progress towards peace and would continue whether or not Sinn Fein took part. "I don't at the moment see any prospect of a ceasefire but even without a ceasefire, the political process will continue for all those parties who accept unreservedly the democratic process." A British newspaper reported last weekend the IRA leadership had decided on a strategy of bombings, allied to a temporary Christmas truce and an announcement on terms for a full ceasefire, in the hope of wringing concessions from Britain. Britain, which wants the guerrillas eventually to yield up stores of hidden armaments, says the IRA must prove any future cessation is not simply a tactical respite. "If there were a ceasefire...it would have to be unambiguous. It would have to be demonstrated by deeds as well as by words," Portillo said.
ECAT	New York City could sell an additional $9 billion of debt if a new city bonding authority is created, boosting its total issuance to $40 billion, city Comptroller Alan Hevesi said Monday. Hevesi, speaking at a Bond Buyer Conference on New York Public Finance here, said the new authority would help solve the city's capital needs over the next several needs. The new authority would allow the city to sell more debt for education and transportation projects without hitting the state constitutional debt limit on city bonds.   The comptroller added that, although the city is nearing its limit, he saw no immediate problems for the city under current debt ceiling. While an expected reduction in the property tax base could reduce the debt ceiling below $31 billion in the next couple of months, the city could still sell debt because it has the flexibility of diverting $1 billion in potential contracts to bond sales, Hevesi said. "That can buy us a couple of months," Hevesi said. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said earlier on Monday at the conference that he expects the authority to be approved by the state legislature because it has general support from the governor and leaders of the state Senate and Assembly. Giuliani said he hoped lawmakers would take up the authority legislation in a special session in December. --Joan Gralla, 212-859-1654
GCAT	Africa's large band of professional footballers are increasingly being caught in a dilemma of club over country as the qualifying campaign for next year's World Cup clashes with the end of the European season. There are more than 250 African footballers who play for first and second division clubs in Europe, from Russia in the east to Portugal in the west, and many of them have to juggle the demands of their employers with the dreams of their countrymen. All 20 of the African countries involved in World Cup qualifiers this weekend will be calling back players from Europe just days before vital matches in league and cup competition. A poignant example is South African fullback Sizwe Motaung, who will play for his country in a vital World Cup qualifier in the Congo on Sunday and then attempt to dash back to help his Spanish club Tenerife in their UEFA Cup semifinal, first leg match against Schalke O4 of Germany on Tuesday. Motaung says it was a tough choice to make and has probably cost him a hard-earned starting berth for the Spanish team which he joined in January. His dilemma is shared by countless African players, hard-pressed to keep their places in their club's first choice side in the wake of repeated travel back to Africa for national team duty. This year countries are competing for five World Cup berths in France next year as well as playing qualifying games for 14 places at the African Nations' Cup finals in Burkina Faso next February. Bachirou Salou, the Togolese striker who plays in Germany's Bundesliga for MSV Duisburg, has already made a choice between the two competitions. "I cannot afford to play in both the World Cup and Nations' Cup qualifiers, so I've decided to only go back and play in the Nations' Cup games where we have a better chance of qualifying," he said. Then there are players whose national team places are also at risk because of club demands. Egyptian defender Yasser Radwan, another African export to the Bundesliga, has risked losing his place in Egypt's team for Sunday's tie against Liberia in neutral Ghana because he has not been able to accede to new coach Mohammed El Gohari's demand that players join camp 14 days ahead of the game. "FIFA rules say that I must only be released seven days before the game and that's what I'm going to do," said Radwan. "I can't afford more time away from my club." The Confederation of African Football (CAF) said it had begun a process of trying to integrate its calendar with that of Europe so as to avoid many of the clashes. "We already have several dates of our qualifiers which overlap with those of Europe when the clubs are not playing and the players are free to return home," said secretary-general Mustapha Fahmy. "We hope in the future to regularise even more of these weekends." One proposal is for African countries to play their qualifiers in midweek as in Europe, Fahmy added. But for the moment African stars still have to tug between patriotism and their monthly pay cheques. "It is really the toughest decision I've ever had to make," said Motaung.
CCAT	Shipping-based Osprey Maritime Ltd shares rose 6.48 percent, or 14 cents, to Singapore $2.30 on Wednesday after it announced a US$750 million takeover of Monaco-based oil and gas carrier Gataas-Larsen Shipping Corp. The shares hit a high of S$2.40 before easing to S$2.30, up 14 cents from its previous close. Volume was a moderate 178,000 units. An analyst with a European brokerage said the volume was moderate because the company's shares are fairly illiquid. "The deal looks fair. It seems Osprey paid a fair price for the vessels that it will be getting," she said.   In the takeover, Osprey will acquire four liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers, four very large crude carriers and a half share of a LNG carrier. Analysts said the main shareholders were backing the project with Gataas-Larsen taking a stake in Osprey. The group's bankers also seemed supportive judging by the response to the syndicated loan facility for the takeover, they said. "There could be more upside to the share of perhaps 10-20 percent even after the rights issue," an analyst said.   Osprey has proposed to take on new net debt of US$493 million and to issue new equity of US$257 million through a one-for-one rights issue as well as a redeemable cumulative convertible preference share. - Singapore Newsroom 65-8703080
CCAT	International Business Machines Corp. Monday unveiled a multimedia version of its DB2 database software that allows users to store and manage video and audio as well as text. The new DB2 Universal Database software also will permit users to access DB2 databases on the Internet and intranets, or internal corporate networks, and will enable the creation of electronic commerce software that takes advantage of multimedia databases. IBM said the software is in beta, or customer, testing and will be generally available in mid-1997. Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM announced the new software one day before a much-anticipated announcement by Informix Corp., which was expected to trot out its Universal Server database management system. Informix's database software can also process multiple types of data such as audio, video and text. Oracle Corp. earlier this year announced a similar product, the Oracle Universal Server, which Oracle is planning to incorporate as part of the next big upgrade of its relational database system, Oracle 8, next year. Analysts said both IBM and Informix are ahead of Oracle in incorporating the new technology in their database software. "I think IBM and Informix have a relatively long lead on the rest of the market," said Steve Hendrick, director of application development tools research at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. "What they have is significantly ahead of everyone else." Hendrick added, though, that Informix and IBM will lose their lead if no software is developed to take advantage of the ability to manage such widely different kinds of data as video and text. For example, one typical use in a big database is a programme called the Fingerprint Extender, which captures images of fingerprints and stores them. In this application, a giant database can be used to track down criminals with pattern-matching techniques comparing a fingerprint obtained at a crime scene with fingerprints stored in a database. IBM's DB2 software was initially developed for its mainframe computers. But a few years ago the computer giant introduced new versions to run on the UNIX operating system, such as IBM's version of UNIX and on its OS/2 software. IBM's DB2 Universal Database will run on many different versions of UNIX, IBM's OS/2 software and on Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system.
ECAT	Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Wednesday that a good inflation performance will lead to a good interest rate climate.   Asked at a media briefing about the prospect for another fall in interest rates after Tuesday's "living wage" decision, Costello said he did not speculate on interest rates. "Interest rates in this country are being managed in accordance with our inflation objective," he told reporters. "Our inflation objective is an underlying rate of 2-3 percent and we are now at the bottom of that band," he said. "What that tells you is that a good inflation performance will lead to a good interest rate climate."   Figures released earlier showed the Australian consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2 percent in the March quarter for an annual inflation rate of 1.3 percent. The Treasury's measure of underlying inflation rose 0.4 percent in the March quarter to stand at 2.1 percent for the year. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
MCAT	Lithuanian shares rose on Tuesday after a two-week slide and dealers said they expected to see further gains. The young bourse's main index rose to 1,443.02, a gain of 26.13 points, amid central market turnover of 341,500 litas. "Banks used to dominate, but investors are showing more interest in industrial companies and other enterprises," said one dealer. "Some of these companies are beginning to show good profit figures and that is stimulating interest," he said, adding that further gains were expected, at least in the short-term. The Birzhiu dairy was the leading blue chip, rising to five litas from 4.81 litas in trade of over 70,000 litas. Nomura is currently managing a $6 million international equity listing for the dairy. There was also almost 3.8 million litas worth of bloc trades on Tuesday. Klaipedos Nafta, an oil terminal partly owned by U.S.-based Lancaster Steel Co, saw over 3.1 million litas worth of its shares traded. Dealers were tight-lipped about the deal but the Lithuanian daily, Lietuvos rytas, said on Monday that Lancaster Steel was preparing to reduce its stake in the terminal. The terminal has plans for a new 20 million litas share capital issue in which Russian oil concerns LUKoil and Yukos are expected to buy stakes. That issue will not be a public offering distributed on the bourse. -- Ed Stoddard, Riga newsroom +371 721 52 40

GCAT	The United States and its European partners appeared still at odds on Thursday as NATO defence ministers met for the last time before a landmark summit to expand the alliance beyond the former Iron Curtain. Washington was expected to tell its allies that it would prefer to see enlargement restricted to only three new members, probably Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, at least for the foreseeable future. But some European countries want to add Romania and Slovenia to NATO's invitation list, which will be announced at a summit in Madrid on July 8-9. "Smaller would be better initially from my perspective," U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen said on Wednesday when asked about Romania and Slovenia. Twelve countries in former communist Eastern Europe have applied for NATO membership. Cohen said he wanted the enlargement restricted to three as he was concerned over the costs, the ability of some easterners to meet the miliary demands of membership, and reservations in the U.S. Senate over any enlargement at all. Meanwhile France, backed by the EU's Christian Democrat leaders including German Chancellor Helmut Kohl this week, is strongly pushing for Romania to be included in the first wave. Advocates argue that both Romania, with its Black Sea coast, and Slovenia, in the volatile Balkan region, offer strategic advantages to NATO. NATO sources said the two-day meeting was unlikely to reach agreement on the final details of a reformed command structure, considered vital to fit the alliance to the realities of the post-Cold War era and make it flexible enough to undertake more Bosnia-style peace missions. They say the election in France of a Socialist government has made it unlikely Paris will carry out earlier plans to reintegrate into the military wing it quit in 1966 in a row over U.S. dominance. French reintegration has been considered to be the price for concessions by other allies, including Britain, on scrapping some commands, which is also seen as necessary to cut costs and create a more flexible grouping as the alliance gets bigger. The allies are also set to debate ways of boosting cooperation with Russia now the former foes have agreed to create a standing NATO-Russia council. NATO signed a new partnership deal with Russia last month as a reluctant Moscow's price for letting the Western alliance take in some of its former communist satellites.

GCAT	Poland's Constitutional Tribunal rejected on Wednesday new laws which gave control of great tracts of land, estimated to be worth more than $1 billion in Warsaw alone, to a society of garden allotment holders. PAP news agency said the Tribunal, which ensures new laws conform with the constitution, ruled against amendments passed by parliament last year, which evoked outraged protests from city authorities including those of the capital. The legislation, backed by the ruling left-wing coalition, handed hosts of the small, lovingly-tended gardens used by almost a million Poles on a 99-year-lease to the Polish Association of Allotment Holders. The Tribunal ruled that last year's law excessively infringed local authorities' ownership rights and it rejected the decision to grant control to only one group, PAP said. The gardens provide a treasured weekend escape for residents of cramped urban apartments and help low-income families or pensioners, who grow food or flowers for sale. The new law was designed to safeguard the holders, who had been renting their plots from the municipalities. But city councils say that they have effectively been stripped of their ownership and that, while wishing to preserve such gardens, they need to use some of the land for important development projects -- with due compensation to gardeners. Warsaw city President Marcin Swiecicki told Reuters before the ruling that in Warsaw's central district alone the issue concerned about 400 hectares (1000 acres) of land, at a time when prime sites were commanding up to $1,000 a square metre. He said that, even if the land value was assessed far lower, "400 hectares reaches a value of more than $1 billion, in the city centre." Warsaw is promoting a building boom as part of a bid to become a regional business centre, and is encouraging office and other construction in open spaces, some of which remain since German invaders levelled the city in World War Two. Mayor Swiecicki said he understood how people valued allotments spaces and wanted them to last as long as possible. But he said that among vital projects affected by the amendments was a plan for a key new road, a proposal to build a European University campus on land currently occupied by allotments on the central Mokotow fields and a sewage project. "The city owns the land and should benefit from it," he said. The Warsaw mayor's office said it had no immediate statement after the Tribunal ruling, which could be over-ruled if the amendment's supporters muster a two-thirds majority in parliament.
ECAT	A senior International Monetary Fund official Wednesday called the current stance of U.K. monetary policy appropriate but suggested that interest rates may have to rise next year if economic growth picks up. "As for the current situation, I think our assessment would be that monetary policy is appropriate," IMF chief economist Michael Mussa told a news conference. Inflation is expected to drop below the authorities' 2-1/2 percent ceiling by early 1997. But Mussa saw a risk that it could pick up again later if U.K. economic growth strengthens, as the IMF expects. "If the pick-up in growth materializes as we expect, then our anticipation would be ... some modest monetary firming would be needed," Mussa said. In its semi-annual World Economic Outlook, the IMF sees U.K. growth picking up to three percent in 1997, from 2.2 percent in 1996. Retail prices, excluding mortgage interest, are expected to rise 2.4 percent in 1997 after advancing 2.7 percent this year. "There may still be some room for some further reduction (in unemployment) without undue inflationary risks," the IMF added.   The IMF is also advocating some modest tightening of British fiscal policy. It warned Britain against cutting taxes sharply before the next general election and said the country instead needed to take action to bring public borrowing back on track. The IMF said financial markets already appear concerned over the budget outlook and could be upset further if taxes were slashed. "There is some risk ... that financial market confidence and long-term interest rates ... could be more adversely affected by continuing fiscal slippage, especially if the authorities were to introduce significant tax cuts before the next general election," the IMF said. "Corrective measures are needed to put the public finances back on track toward the authorities' goal of balance over the medium term," it added. The Fund though was generally upbeat about the outlook for the British economy, forecasting faster growth and lower inflation next year.
ECAT	IMF backing for Pakistan's package of economic reforms is likely to boost local markets and attract foreign investors, analysts said on Saturday. "We have an industry- and export-friendly economic reforms package, the IMF's approval and the start of an India-Pakistan dialogue," said Anisur Rehman, head of research at SocGen-Crosby Securities. "All these developments combined are likely to provide a very positive environment for foreign investors to make their entry, " he said. The Karachi Stock Exchange's 100-share index ended 17.55 points lower at 1,598.94 on Friday after the announcement of the package, which dealers said fell short of expectations. Analyst Munir Ladha of AKD Securities said the fall should be seen as a "knee-jerk reaction" and the index would improve after investors had a deeper look into the reforms. Kalim Aziz, research head at ING Baring Securities. said tax and tariff cuts in the Friday reforms package will result in a 46 percent rise in earnings. The International Monetary Fund MF said on Saturday it welcomed the package announced on Friday and hoped it would provide a basis for adoption of an enhanced structual adjustment loan. "The successful implementation of the government's reform measures accompanying macro-economic improvements will provide basis for the adoption of multi-year arrangements under the concessional Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and Extended Fund Facility (EFF)," an IMF press statement said. Rehman said IMF approval of the package would draw foreign portfolio investors who moved to the sidelines after the Fund suspenced a standby loan earlier this month on Pakistan's failure to meet agreed targets. Top foreign ministry officials of Pakistan and India resumed peace talks in New Delhi on Friday, more than four years after dialogue broke down in January 1994 over the disputed Himalyan region of Kashmir. Tension over Kashmir sparked two of the three wars the regional arch-rivals have fought since independence in 1947. "The market is trading at its lower end, very near the bottom, and these developments should provide an attractive entry point," Rehman said.

MCAT	Asian dollar deposit rates were quietly steady in moderate trade on Tuesday with most traders sidelined ahead of tonight's release of the U.S. second quarter productivity/unit labor costs data, dealers said. Productivity in the second quarter is forecast to have risen 0.7 percent after a 2.6 percent increase reported in the first quarter. Unit labor costs for the second quarter is expected to be around 2.7 percent against the first quarter's 2.5 percent. "Rates were narrowly mixed in the morning on some position adjustments amid uncertainty over the near term direction of the market," a local dealer said.   "Some traders were waiting for fresh clues to market direction from tonight's release of the second quarter productivity/unit labor costs figures, but unless the numbers are way off market expectations, I don't think there will be much impact," he said. In day-to-day rates, Tuesday/Wednesday eased 1/16 percentage point to 5-9/16 5-7/16 percent, Wednesday/Thursday rose 1/16 point to 5-11/16 5-9/16 and week-fixed eased 1/16 point to 5-9/16 5-7/16 percent.

GCAT	Sicilian Archbishop Salvatore Cassisa, one of the highest-ranking Catholic Churchmen ever to face Italian justice, went on trial on Wednesday on charges of corruption and defrauding the European Union. Cassisa, of the Sicilian town of Monreale, was not present at the start of the trial in Palermo's justice palace, where he stands accused along with five other people on various counts. He tops a charge sheet compiled by Palermo prosecutor Luigi Patronaggio. The 75-year-old prelate, who denies wrongdoing, faces up to four years in jail if convicted. The prelate is charged with extortion and attempted extortion connected to bribes the prosecution says were demanded from construction companies and artisans seeking contracts for work on Monreale cathedral from 1990 to 1993. Cassisa is head of a foundation administering the splendid 12th century Norman cathedral complex just outside the Sicilian capital. Ordered built by William II, it is considered one of the architectural wonders of the Middle Ages. The prosecution charges that Daniela Lima and Fulvio Lima, respectively the foundation's building supervisor and administrator, demanded bribes at a rate of about 10 percent of the value of each reconstruction and restoration project. It alleges that Cassisa, the foundation's president, was in complicity with the two Limas over the bribes. Cassisa told prosecutor Patronaggio he was not aware of bribes. "We aim to dismantle the accusations point by point," Cassisa's lawyer Angelo Bonfiglio told Reuters. Bonfiglio said Cassisa was the victim of "internal cannibalism" by priests in Sicily who wanted to smear him and were the first to tell magistrates of alleged irregularities. In one episode, the three are charged with demanding a bribe of 50 million lire ($30,000) from one construction company. Other, smaller bribes were demanded for projects to restore some of the cathedral's famous gold mosaics. Archbishop Cassisa is further accused of nepotism in distributing contracts and of diverting funds from the foundation into his private bank accounts. Patronaggio told the court in his opening statements that police who searched Cassisa's home in September 1994 found handwritten notes about the alleged bribes. The prosecutor also said police found documentation about various bank accounts including one with a balance of 1.5 billion lire ($900,000) set up in the Vatican Bank and destined for the Monreale seminary. He said they also found letters Cassisa had written to leading Italian politicians including former prime minister Giulio Andreotti asking for financial contributions to help restore the Monreale cathedral. In the other main strand of the case, Cassisa is accused along with two Sicilian agricultural inspectors of defrauding the European Union of some 200 million lire ($120,000). The prosecution alleges that Cassisa and two inspectors of a local agricultural board intentionally overstated the size of a Church vineyard which was put out of production in order to reduce wine production and receive an EU farm subsidy. Prosecutor Patronnagio's charge sheet says Cassisa reaped "an unjust profit and damaged others" through the vineyard scam. Investigators using aerial photographs determined that the vineyard that was uprooted was smaller than the 38 hectares Cassisa and the two local inspectors had declared. The trial was adjourned to March 18. ($1=1,663 lire)
MCAT	The Mediterranean was the star of the crude tanker market on Thursday as rates for 80,000 tonne vessels rose further after spectacular gains on Wednesday, brokers said. Cross-Med ships were fixed at up to W170, from the W155 seen on Wednesday when rates rose about 50 points, on continued high demand and an acute shortage of tonnage, they added. "There are a lot of orders, especially for prompt positions and end-January/early February. Most ships have disappeared. If there is just one left it will get good money," an Italian broker said. "The only fresh news is in the Med market," he added, noting that rates in other sectors were flat. The Middle East market showed little change with very large crude carriers (VLCCs) westwards fixed at W55 and to Japan around W65, while VLCCs on transatlantic voyages continued at about W62.5 from the North Sea to the U.S. and from West Africa. Rates for 130,000 tonners from West Africa showed a firmer tone. Although W95 was still being done on West Africa/U.S. trips, one broker said rates were date-sensitive with slightly higher numbers seem for later fixtures, especially to Asia. "You can't find the ships to China and Korea," he added. Inter-U.K./Cont rates for 80,000 tonners were steady at around W115, brokers said. Fuel oil was likewise little changed, with 25,000 tonne cargoes fixed at W195 inter-U.K./Cont and cross-Med around W190. In the U.S., 70,000 tonnes Caribs/upcoast continued to be fixed at around W167.5/175 and 50,000-tonne fuel oil cargoes Caribs/USAC at about W180. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 4088

ECAT	U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday launched a push for legislation that would give him authority to negotiate trade pacts, including a deal to bring Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement. Clinton named Recording Industry Association of America Chairman Jason Berman to head the administration's effort to win passage in Congress of the so-called fast track trade negotiation legislation. "Every president, Republican and Democrat, in the past two decades has had this vital tool to maintain effective American leaderhip in the global economy," Clinton said in a statement announcing Berman's appointment. "I am calling on Congress to enact fast-track legislation so we can continue our aggressive drive to open markets to our goods and services and create more high skilled jobs for the American people," he added. The president met with Democratic members of the House of Representatives to discuss plans to get the legislation passed. "It was a very open exchange both on the substance of fast track, on trade issues, on the politics of it, so it was a very positive, good meeting," Secretary of Commerce William Daley said after the meeting. Clinton has yet to send Congress -- controlled by Republicans -- proposed legislation on the fast track authority, which would allow U.S. officials to negotiate trade agreements without fear they will later be changed. Under fast track, lawmakers give up their right to amend trade agreements and would only vote for or against them. Daley, who led the administration's effort to win Congressional passage of NAFTA in 1993, said it would help the administration to have Berman "totally focused" on getting the fast track legislation through Congress. "There is an advantage in this sort of fight to bring in somebody who, for a very short period of two and half or three months, is totally focused on an issue that will be very difficult and pulling all the different pieces together," Daley said. Berman has been with the Recording Industry Association of America since 1987 and has played a role in the U.S. effort to reduce piracy of sound recordings and open markets to legitimate products around the world, the trade group said. The administration has been without fast track trade negotiation authority since 1994. Trade advocates in Congress and the business community want it to propose legislation and get it through Congress. They fear that, without it, U.S. companies would lose market opportunities in Latin America to European and Japanese competitors. The White House decided to wait until September before proposing legislation because officials wanted to wait until most of the work with Congress on a balance budget agreement and tax cuts was completed. The legislation has also been delayed by a dispute between Democrats and Republicans over whether labour and environmental issues should be included in trade negotiations. The fast track authority is needed for U.S. officials to negotiate expansion of NAFTA to include Chile, with which NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico have separate trade agreements. Fast track would also allow U.S. officials to push ahead with negotiations to create a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas by 2005. And it is needed for a global round of negotiations on agriculture trade set to start in 1999.

GCAT	Austrian police said on Monday they were holding a total of four men on suspicion of producing child pornography in an international child prostitution ring spanning central Europe. A fourth suspect, a 48-year-old Austrian citizen from Salzburg, was arrested on August 31 and is in detention by court order pending further investigation, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. Three others, aged between 40 and 51 and based in Vienna, were arrested last week and also remain in detention pending investigation. Two are Austrian citizens, one born in Slovakia and the other in the Czech Republic. The third is Polish. In what marked the start of a major operation to hunt down suspected child sex abusers in Austria, vice squad officers last week seized boxes of videos and other pornographic material from the home of one of the four suspects. Police said the search for others involved in the child sex trade ring could spill over into neighbouring Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Germany. Police declined to comment on whether there was any connection between the arrests and a Belgian child pornography scandal in which at least two young girls were murdered. Belgian Marc Dutroux, alleged to be the ringleader in a paedophile pornography circuit, has been named by police in the Slovak capital Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of one Slovak woman and the kidnapping of another. The series of sex scandals has deeply shocked Austrians, already troubled by last week's revelations of another alleged sex case in Linz, 200 km (120 miles) west of Vienna, involving the abuse of refugee children as young as four. The prosecuting attorney in Linz said on Monday that two Austrian men arrested for suspected sex abuse of children from a refugee home had been released pending further investigation. The news of the releases provoked an outcry from social workers, who expressed concern about the young victims' safety. "It doesn't seem to be sensible that the two alleged culprits are free again," said Josef Weidenholzer, head of the social organisation Volkshilfe in Linz. "Someone must not have been thinking what consequences this could have." The men were alleged to have lured children from the refugee shelter by offering them between 500 and 5,000 schillings ($50 to $500) for sex, sources close to the investigation said. "One of the men allegedly focused on little girls and the other only dealt with little boys," Weidenholzer said. Austrian current affairs weekly News last week published a investigative report into extensive child sexual exploitation in the region. It said the ring provided clients in Vienna with a choice of 70 girls, largely from Slovakia, aged between seven and 13. The Volkshilfe, which has been investigating the refugee sex abuse claims for an undisclosed period, said that case also probably involved a larger ring of professional child abusers. "The sums of money involved are too large and our investigations have shown the contact between the children and their abusers was frequent," Weidenholzer said. "There were certainly more people involved in this terrible tragedy."
ECAT	UK retail sales data may be marginally understating the strength of consumer activity because the index has not been re-weighted since 1992, an Office of National Statistics statistician said on Tuesday. "My view is that it would be understating the strength slightly but we don't know how significant the impact is. I'd be surprised if it was more than marginal," said Harry Duff, ONS retail sales statistician. "In terms of the three-month on three-month and year-on-year comparisons, the current series is still a good indicator of trend," he told Reuters. Areas of key concern include fast growing shopping venues such as out of town hypermarkets, he said. The series has not been updated for so long because statisticians were awaiting the new ONS business register which contains a definitive list of British firms. This means that all the different series of data can now be drawn from standardized lists, making comparisons between figures easier. The re-classification of British industry groups also caused a delay, Duff said. He expects the weightings to be rejigged by the summer of 1998 for 1995 or 1996 figures and says this may even happen this year. The latest British retail sales figures show an annual rise of 4.6 percent in February, the highest rate since March 1989. Some economists played down the significance of any tardiness in re-weighting the official data. "I don't think the weightings matter," BZW economist Robert Barrie said. "Retail sales and consumer spending are simply not living up to some of the more extravagant forecasts." -- Cheryl Juckes, London newsroom +44 171 542 5109.
GCAT	Russian President Boris Yeltsin appeared on television on Tuesday for the first time in three weeks, gesticulating as he chatted with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and smiling broadly as he spoke to the secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The president, who is recovering from pneumonia, has clearly lost weight since he fell ill, but he looked relaxed during two brief film clips. There was no soundtrack and it was not clear exactly what was being discussed. Aides said Yeltsin, who turns 66 on Saturday, visited the Kremlin on Tuesday for the second time since he left hospital to meet Chernomyrdin and CIS secretary Ivan Korotchenya. Presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin had spent three hours in the Kremlin before returning to the state residence outside Moscow where he is recovering. Yeltsin's political opponents have questioned the president's ability to rule Russia and have discussed trying to remove him for health reasons. The president also went to the Kremlin on January 22. That visit was not shown on television and it failed to dampen speculation about Yeltsin's ability to rule. Yeltsin, acting on doctors' orders, on Monday cancelled a planned trip to the Netherlands to meet senior European officials. But aides say French President Jacques Chirac will visit Moscow as planned on Sunday.

GCAT	War in eastern Zaire is affecting an increasingly wide area, with more people fleeing and ever greater numbers going hungry, aid workers said on Friday. Spain, one of the backers of a proposed international intervention force in Zaire, said hundreds of thousands would die of hunger before effective help arrived. Food riots hit the eastern city of Goma on Friday morning. Armed rebels fired into the air to beat back more than 1,000 hungry people trying to seize the last food in a U.N. warehouse. "I have had nothing to eat today and nothing but water yesterday," said 60-year-old Fessu Mahkenya. No food has entered Goma, which has an estimated population of about 200,000, since rebel forces seized the city late last week. Virtually all its shops and hotels have been looted. An emergency health committee in Goma appealed on Friday for agencies to intervene and supply medicine and medical equipment. Goma's last foreign aid workers fled to Rwanda last Saturday after fierce battles which killed more than 400 people. "The whole international community is called to immediate action at the highest level before it is too late," said Jean Nicholas Kasereka Busara, who heads the city's health committee. "This tragedy will become far worse unless urgent measures are taken," said the committee, adding that 300,000 Zaireans had been hit by the conflict, which entered a fourth week on Friday. A Spanish government spokesman in Madrid said hundreds of thousands would die before effective aid arrived in the region. "The plan is going to work. The U.S. and international community will send troops," said the spokesman. "But it will be too late anyhow. Now people are starving, they are dying from hunger. When these troops reach Kindu (Zaire), it will be too late. Hundreds of thousands will be dead at that time." A complex multi-sided war in eastern Zaire has cut off more than one million Rwandan refugees from the outside world and also driven more and more uprooted Zaireans to hunger. A Spanish aid worker who fled Zaire on Wednesday told a meeting in Nairobi of virtual mayhem in the east as some 175,000 refugees fled two camps after looting aid agency warehouses. U.N. officials quoted him as saying competing armed groups of Zairean soldiers, Rwandan Hutu militiamen and refugees were rampaging in the region, looting camps and Zairean villages. He said the 175,000 refugees who fled Kahindo and Katale camps headed west through wide lava fields, which emit dangerous gases, and some died from lack of food and water. "We were amazed to see some of them climb up mountains. We could see the campfires at night," said the aid worker, twice threatened with execution by former Rwandan troops. Weeks of hand-wringing by governments and aid agencies have so far produced no international consensus on what can be done. But diplomatic efforts on Friday concentrated on Rwanda, a key player because of its backing for the rebels in Zaire. U.N. special envoy Raymond Chretien on Friday started talks in the Rwandan capital Kigali with the country's leaders to seek their support for a U.N. force in eastern Zaire. "Without Rwanda's support, the whole operation could end up very, very messy or even impossible to launch," a U.N. diplomat told Reuters. The Rwandan Hutu refugees, half of them under 16, include tens of thousands of former Rwandan army troops and militiamen who fled their homeland in 1994 after the genocide of up to one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Armed Hutus, fearing death if they return to Rwanda, now guard what is left of the refugee camps in Zaire and have denied access to outsiders since an insurrection involving Tutsis and other Zaireans cut them off from foreign aid. On Thursday Zairean villagers near the huge Mugunga camp west of Goma said Rwandan Hutu fighters seized about 100 local children to use as human shields in case of a rebel advance on the camp. The food riots in Goma showed that Zaireans themselves, not just the Rwandan refugees, are caught up in a tragedy of growing proportions. Aid workers said on Friday the conflict was affecting wide stretches of the eastern Zaire borderlands and many villagers were fleeing into the bush and refugees into lava fields and up mountains. A U.N. spokeswoman in Geneva said on Friday the U.N. refugee agency had so far not received satellite photographs requested from Western states in late October to track the refugees.
ECAT	Ukrainian banks began receiving Treasury bill payments from the Finance Ministry several hours late on Thursday, and the central bank chairman promised there would be no more delays. Representatives of Bank Ukraina and TK Kredit bank said payments for interest and principal on nine- and twelve-month T-bills arrived just after 5 p.m. (1400 GMT). The ministry's payment to banks of 4.116 trillion karbovanets ($23.3 million) was due on September 18 although the ministry usually effects payments the morning after the due date. It was the third time in less than a month that the ministry has been late on its payments. "Today the issue was discussed with the prime minister and it was raised before the president, about the ministry's failure to fulfill its obligations," central bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko told reporters. "I think that measures have been taken that will guarantee that this issue is closed forever," he said. Yushchenko did not elaborate on the measures. A Finance Ministry spokesman said he could not explain the delay. On August 29, the ministry delayed a $23 million payment for half a day and on September 11 a similar delay occurred with a $22 million payment. Ukraine has replaced the karbovanets currency with the hryvnia, but some calculations on T-bill transactions are still being conducted in the old currency. The hryvnia, unchanged at 1.76 to the dollar since its introduction on September 2, equals 100,000 karbovanets. --Irene Marushko, Kiev Newsroom +380 44 229 2264

The new figure brought growth in the first nine months of the year to 7.0 percent over the same period last year, the bank said in its biweekly report. The Imacec, a kind of preliminary barometer of gross domestic product growth, rose 5.7 percent last month. The September figure was on the low end of most expectations and gave a new sign that economic growth was slowing in Chile due to restrictive Central Bank monetary policies. --Roger Atwood, Santiago newsroom +56-2-699-5595 x211
GCAT	French President Jacques Chirac said on Friday he saw a "revolution" in Europe in its growing acceptance of a need for a social model to protect its citizens from unemployment and poverty. Chirac, speaking two days ahead of a parliamentary election in France, also said Europe needed to look harder at ways of reviving weak economic growth, which he blamed for joblessness and exclusion of many from mainstream society. France has long fought for Europe to maintain much of its system of welfare and worker protection, rather than adopting the free market policies of the United States which some believe would help bring down its record unemployment. Chirac said the idea of a "social model" was gathering support, and noted plans to make legally binding a commitment to fighting unemployment through a revision to European Union treaties. Britain's new Labour government has also agreed to sign up to the European Union's social chapter, which sets minimum standards for workers, reversing years of resistance by the outgoing conservatives. "If we succeed in getting the idea of a European social model taken on board, it is a revolution," he told a news conference during a summit of EU leaders in the Dutch seaside town of Noordwijk. Chirac said he had stressed the need to tackle weak growth during the summit. "Europe is the only region in the world where growth is weak," he said. "We have to go a bit further to look for solutions to this problem of inadequate growth and its social consequences." He said only one European leader had called for greater labour force flexibility to reduce joblessness -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair -- and was greeted with silence. And while Europe needed to reduce the social charges which weighed too heavily on the cost of labour, it must avoid the kind of full liberalisation which would fragment society. France's centre-right government, campaigning for re-election in the two-round vote on May 25 and June 1, has been fighting to fend off charges by the opposition Socialist party that its policies would exacerbate unemployment and poverty through new austerity measures. Chirac's comments appeared meant to underline the commitment of the mainstream right-wing in France to work actively to boost growth and tackle unemployment.
GCAT	President Bill Clinton's decision to certify Mexico as a U.S. partner in the war on drugs drew strong bipartisan criticism in Congress on Friday along with a pledge to try to overturn the action. "The law requires the president to certify that Mexico has 'cooperated fully with the United States, or taken adequate steps on its own' to combat drug trafficking. I do not see how such an assertion can be made," Sen. Dianne Feinstein said. "I now intend to work with my colleagues to prepare and submit a resolution to disapprove this decision in the Congress," Feinstein, a California Democrat, said in a statement. Such a resolution would have to be passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate and sent to Clinton. If the president vetoed it, as he almost certainly would, it would have to be passed again by a two-thirds majority in order to become effective. "I believe that a bipartisan majority in Congress will overturn the president's certification of Mexico. I will work to make that happen," Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, said. "Have we received some cooperation from Mexico?" asked Feinstein. "Undoubtedly. President (Ernesto) Zeillo and many others are working with us in good faith. But have we received full cooperation? Not even close," she said. "We cannot continue to allow the drug cartels to operate out of Mexico with a wink and a nod by the Mexican government," Idaho Republican Sen. Larry Craig said. New Jersey Democrat Sen. Robert Torricelli said the decision would be difficult to explain to U.S. law enforcement officers. "I genuinely regret this decision," he said. He said he believed Colombia, which was decertified, made more progress against drugs last year than Mexico. Feinstein, Craig and Torricelli were among 40 senators who sent a letter to Clinton this week urging him to decertify Mexico. House members, including Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri, have also called for decertification because of widespread government corruption. "Recent events make it clear that certifying Mexico at this time is the wrong message to send to the drug kingpins. It says business as usual can continue," Gephardt said. Sen. Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat, said he was disappointed by Clinton's decision. New Mexico Republican Sen. Pete Domenici said Mexico must prove itself as an ally to avoid decertification next year. Congressional opposition to Mexico's certification intensified after the arrest last week of Mexico's anti-narcotics chief, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, accused of taking bribes from a drug kingpin. Critics in Congress said they feared Gutierrez might have passed on sensitive information to drug cartel leaders. They also complained that Mexico refused to honour U.S. extradition requests for cartel leaders and failed to cooperate with U.S. drug agents operating in Mexico.

ECAT	South Korea's entry into the OECD club of rich nations would speed up the government's deregulation drive, analysts said on Saturday. But critics and opposition parties warn against the adverse impact of further prying open local markets to offshore competition, especially on small and medium-sized industries. Friday's decision by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to invite South Korea into the Paris-based group of industrialised nations has met enthusiastic applause from finance ministry officials. Seoul predicts the long-sought invitation will be swiftly ratified by South Korea's 299-seat National Assembly, in which President Kim Young-sam's ruling party has a slim majority. "I see little problem at the parliament as opposition parties would not want to see the nation's image hurt by a rejection," Hyun Jung-taik, Director-General for the ministry's International Economic Policy Bureau, told Reuters. The government's optimism appeared justified on Saturday after the main opposition party announced it would reconsider its stance on entry into the 28-member OECD, backing away from a vow on Friday to block the move in parliament. "There has been no change in our stance that it's too early for the nation to join the club," said Chung Dong-young, a spokesman for the National Congress for New Politics party. "But now that the decision was made, we see the necessity for reconsideration," he added. Critics fear OECD membership will only hamper the economy by triggering a rush of foreign competition which could squeeze local small to medium sized firms while raising the risk of a volatile share market by attracting more offshore funds. "Smaller firms have owed much of their business to various protective policies by the government. But now, the government would not be able to continue this," said Lee Hahn-ku, president of the Daewoo Research Institute. The Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice, one of South Korea's major lobby groups, said it would mount nationwide campaign to block ratification of OECD admission. "Entry at this time, when financial industries are not prepared for foreign competition, would only stir chaos," said Ra Young-sam, a senior official at the coalition. "It's absolutely premature and we will block it." Since the early 1990s, South Korea has taken steps to slowly open its markets, offering to announce new measures to speed up the process if it won OECD membership. On October 1, the ceiling on foreign ownership in local stocks was raised to 20 percent for most South Korean listed companies from 18 percent. The government has pledged to expand the ceiling by three percentage points every year by 1999. Foreign investment in unsecured corporate bonds issued by small and medium-sized firms will be allowed from late 1998. Analysts said the huge gap between South Korea's long-term interest rates, now hovering over 12 percent, and the lower rates of most OECD-member nations could attract a rush of speculative funds into South Korea. "Whether we gain or lose from the admission will depend on how well the government can prepare for every possible scenario," said Lee of Daewoo. An OECD statement on Friday said South Korea would be the 11th largest exporter in the OECD zone and accounted for about 2.5 percent of world exports, a position which had been enhanced through liberalisation of its own import controls. South Korea would be the second Asian nation after Japan to become a member at the club. From the wider Asia-Pacific area, Australia and New Zealand are also members of the OECD.
MCAT	United Arab Emirates shares resisted a wave of selling pressure in the week to Thursday to end without any significant price changes, brokers said. They said buying interest remained low for the second week running as most investors focused their demand on a 209 million dirham public offering by a new UAE insurance firm. "Subscription in Al-Khazna Insurance Company which started on Tuesday was the centre of attention," one broker said. He said small investors resorted to selling some recently- acquired shares as the 12-day subscription period was too short for them to arrange alternative funding to buy into the new flotation. But shares managed to hold recent levels. Dubai Investment Co (DIC) was the exception, with its share price ending half a dirham lower at 12.5 dirhams. Other share prices were unchanged.

ECAT	Life in Australia is pretty good. The sun shines most of the year. The beaches are clean, and official data shows Australia boasts bigger gross domestic product (GDP) growth than many other developed nations. But a debate has emerged over just to measure that success. Is GDP the best indicator of Australia's development? Does it take into account, for example, the environment impact of economic expansion? Does it measure the cost of unemployment? A number of economic forecasters believe current statistics stop short of providing a true picture of Australia's standard of living. In fact, the government's Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) plans to issue a new measure of lifestyle. Real GDP per person in Australia increased steadily from about A$9,000 ($6,660) in 1950 to more than A$23,000 in 1996, said Clive Hamilton executive director of the Australia Institute, a Canberra-based think tank. Such a rise in GDP is usually interpreted as showing that Australians have become progressively better off. NEW MEASURE OF SUCCESS But according to Hamilton, the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) developed by the Australia Institute, which includes 23 other variables covering social and environmental factors, shows Australians are not so much better off. Hamilton said starting from A$9,000 in 1950, the GPI rises to A$16,000 in 1996, lower than the comparative GDP figure, reflecting growing costs of unemployment, higher levels of foreign debt and increased costs of environmental damage. "The cost of environmental damage is over A$3,000 per person each year in Australia," said Hamilton, adding that this was one of the reasons why the GPI average was lower than the GDP average over the past 46 years. "GDP was not and never intended to be a measure of national welfare," said Roger Beale, secretary of the department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. Beale said his department was looking at plans to issue a range of data on the environment to reflect Australia's water quality, the rate of soil erosion and extent of air pollution. "We are pushing along a suite of environmental indicators to help us measure whether or not our environment is improving or going backwards," Beale told Reuters. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS The Australia Institute's Hamilton said the cost of climate change amounted to about A$14.7 billion in 1996, land degradation A$4.51 billion, air pollution A$6.58 billion and urban water pollution A$3.58 billion. The cost of environmental damage has started to affect Australia significantly for about 20 years, these figures show. "The reason why things have not been getting any better since the late 1970s are because of the impact of these environmental damages," Hamilton said. The ABS said it expects to make an announcement soon on how it should improve its monitoring of the country's social and environmental progress. "What we are looking at is a multi-dimensional indicator, in which you are looking at the economic development, the social development, environmental development; they are all linked and what you need is a multi-dimensional approach to the problem and the ABS is working through this," said Dennis Trewin, deputy statistician at the ABS. Trewin said a multi-dimensional indicator would be released through a series of indicators that reflect social and environmental changes such as resource depletion or the amount of money spent correcting environmental damage. The ABS has increased the amount of data released on the environment recently. In June 1996, the bureau published for the first time a scorecard on Australia's environment in a report called Australians and the Environment. THE BROADER VIEW The Australia Institute's Hamilton said they had modified the GPI, an idea that was developed in the United States, for Australia and could only be issued once a year due to the information required. "This is not a substitution for GDP. GDP is a very good measure for short-term macro-economic management. GPI is a wider, longer-term measure of well being," Hamilton said. "With the GPI, we have factored in things like the cost of overwork as well as the cost of unemployment." Hamilton added there was a need to issue broader data than the GDP figure because it would help governments make policies that reflected the state of the relevant economic, social and environment indicators. "If we fail to go beyond GDP then, in the words of the United Nations Development Programme, we will continue to navigate with a faulty instrument," Hamilton told a conference on measuring national progress in Canberra recently.

CCAT	Europe's network of internet companies is set to consolidate over the next 18 months, with smaller service providers being swallowed up by telecoms firms and larger providers, an internet conference heard on Monday. Chris Champion, analyst for the Yankee Group telecoms consultancy, said Europe's internet network had grown up as a patchwork of operations with no single company dominating. "There is no dominant pan-European player," said Champion, "But I expect a handful of them to emerge over the next 18 months. There aren't any at the moment because it's a nascent market compared to the United States." Champion told the conference that, unlike in the US, much of the European internet "backbone" infrastructure was still largely in academic and non-profit hands, although commercial firms were involved in building and running those backbones. He saw cross-border deals emerging as telecoms companies, often with dominating positions in their home markets, looked abroad for more internet business. "The bigger players, which are the telecoms players and the internet alliances, haven't really moved out of their home markets yet. I expect this to happen very soon," he told Reuters in an interview after his presentation. Consolidation would happen as the bigger players hunted down the potential revenues on offer, perhaps looking for acquisitions and beefing up alliances. Champion estimated that the 3.2 million European internet-using households currently generated around $640 million a year in access business. He projected that by 2000 Europe would have 16 million internet households generating over $3.0 billion. "Europe has woken up late. You could say that 1995 in the US was the year of the internet and internet hype. We really didn't get going until 1996. In a sense we're more subtle and don't fall for the hype and do things at our own speed." Other reasons for the relatively slow European internet roll-out were comparatively low personal computer ownership rates and high local phone charges, Champion said. He tipped operators such as UUNet Technologies Inc of the US, Global One, the venture linking Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Sprint Corp, and the AT&T Unisource telecoms grouping to emerge as major competitors in the growing European market. -- Keiron Henderson, Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 500 5000
GCAT	France expressed horror on Friday after a bomb killed up to four people in a cafe in Tel Aviv and urged all sides in the Middle East to show restraint to prevent further violence. "The French government learned with horror and consternation of the heinous attack that has just been committed in Tel Aviv. It expresses it sympathy to the families of the victims," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It also voiced concern over violence in Hebron and Jerusalem, where Palestinians are protesting against the construction of a disputed Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. "The government also expresses its concern and dismay in the light of the serious incidents in Jerusalem and Hebron," the statement said. "It launches an appeal for reason to triumph over passion and to avoid all acts, measures or remarks that could aggravate the situation and increase tension," the statement said. "The logic of peace and concertation can and must triumph," it said.
GCAT	POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER OFFICIAL RATE CUT LOOMS A slight rise in the official unemployment rate to 8.8 percent has prompted speculation that the Reserve Bank will again cut official interest rates. Figures out today show an extra 40,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed last month, despite a fall in the participation rate. Senior economist with BT Australia, Rory Robertson, says these figures, and other recent economic indicators, demonstrate how difficult it is for the economy to improve. Mr Robertson says economic data remains weak, and the market is putting immense pressure on the Reserve to again lower rates. Meanwhile, the Federal Opposition's employment spokesman, Martin Ferguson, says the rise in the jobless rate shows how badly the Government is failing unemployed people. Mr Ferguson says it appears as if some sections of the community are giving up hope. He says the Prime Minister needs to show leadership if the hard decisions on policies to encourage employment growth are to be made. - - - - BEAZLEY SAYS PM MUST GUARANTEE NEWCASTLE'S FUTURE The Federal Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, has told a rally of workers in Newcastle it is Prime Minister John Howard's job to demand BHP continues steel-making in the city. Mr Beazley, New South Wales Premier Bob Carr and ACTU leader, Jennie George, have told workers pressure has to be maintained on BHP and the Federal Government to ensure a future for manufacturing in the region. BHP workers marched on the steelworks after the rally. Mr Beazley says its the Prime Minister's duty to ensure the future of manufacturing in Newcastle. - - - - MOORE: EFFORT REQUIRED TO COMBAT RACIST TAG FOR AUSTRALIA The Federal Government has backed a call for the tourism industry to take action to counteract damage to Australia's reputation caused by the racism debate. The Australian Tourist Commission believes comments by Independent MP, Pauline Hanson, will have negative long-term effects on how Australia is perceived, especially in Asia. Tourism Minister, John Moore, says the Government has made clear its position on Pauline Hanson's views, and it is up to all Australians to reinforce the nation's image as a friendly and welcoming country. Mr Moore has also accused some Asian interests of capitalising on the race debate in Australia. He says it sometimes pays Australia's competition as a tourist destination to play-up perceived racism in Australia. - - - - SEARCH FOR KERRY WHELAN HOMES IN ON NATIONAL PARK The search for clues to the disappearance of Kerry Whelan is focusing on an old mining area in the New South Wales southern highlands. The 39-year-old vanished from a carpark in Parramatta more than five weeks ago. Police say the search of the Morton National Park is in extremely rugged and dangerous terrain. So far today, nothing of value has been found. Tomorrow, police will start searching the 60 abandoned mines in the area, and police divers have been placed on stand-by. - - - - LESSONS FROM BLACKHAWK COLLISION WILL "MAKE ARMY MORE RESILIENT" The chief of the army says the Blackhawk helicopter disaster is a reminder of the dangers faced by young Australians responsible for defending their country. A memorial service in Canberra today marked the first anniversary of the collision near Townsville, which killed 18 servicemen flying a night-time anti-terrorism exercise. The ceremony, at the Royal Military College Chapel, is one of several being held around the country. Army chief Lieutenant General John Sanderson told the gathering there were many reasons not to forget the Blackhawk disaster. He said it will be a constant reminder of the demands placed on military personnel both in training and in war. Lieutenant General Sanderson said the memories and lessons may be hard, but they are lessons nevertheless which add to the resilience and strength of the Army. - - - - CRICKET: BICHEL'S ASHES TOUR OVER Fast bowler Andy Bichel's Ashes cricket tour has come to an end after a prolonged back injury, which has limited the Queenslander to bowling just five overs since the tour began.

ECAT	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin Wednesday lauded the state of the global economy, saying it was in better shape than it has been in a long time. In remarks before the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Rubin said "the fundamentals of the world economy look as solid as they've been for a long, long time." He said America too was enjoying solid growth with low inflation. "I believe that if we continue to follow the right policy path in this country, we can have solid growth and low inflation on balance over the long term."   Rubin told the gathering of 181 countries that much of the success in the recent period reflected what is now a widespread consensus on the best economic policies to follow. "That consensus is to open markets, not close them, free business to compete, not restrain them, reduce deficits, not sustain them, and invest publicly in people, infrastructure and other areas critical to future productivity," he said. He said the U.S. was committed to meeting its financial responsibilities to the multilateral lending organizations and pledged the administration's "fullest and upmost effort" to work with Congress to achieve that.   Rubin praised World Bank President James Wolfensohn and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus for "lifting the fight against corruption to the top of the agenda." He called corruption a major impediment to economic development. Rubin also urged the IMF and Bank to work together to help shore up banking systems in emerging market economies, saying that too often banking problems undermine economic growth.
ECAT	Eleven economists polled by Reuters in a survey issued on Friday forecast an average 2.1 percent year-on-year rise in Danish consumer prices for March, down from February's 2.2 percent. The estimates ranged from 1.9 percent to 2.3 percent. The analysts foresaw the rise from February to March at an average 0.4 percent, with estimates in the +0.2-+2.7 percent range. There was no monthly rise in February. The estimates were based on the domestic calculation method.

ECAT	Honduras on Thursday announced deep budget cuts under a program designed to win new credits from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The government agreed to trim its operating budget by 20 percent, saving some 450 million lempiras ($35 million) in 1997, even as this impoverished Central American country has been rocked by a series of strikes and social protests. "These measures are aimed at guaranteeing control over public spending and at a fiscal deficit of 3.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)," Central Bank President Hugo Pino told reporters. Honduras's budget deficit was 3.4 percent of GDP in 1996. The agreement clears Honduras to receive $120 million to $140 million in credits this year, Pino said. The loans are crucial considering the entire operating budget is $994 million. The agreement reached on Thursday came after the government and the IMF last week failed to reach a more stringent three-year spending plan for the government. Under that IMF-preferred plan, Honduras would have had to cut deficit spending to two percent of GDP in order to receive $200 million in IMF loans this year. Such deep cuts are political impossibile in a country where resources already are stretched to the breaking point. "That's just not possible considering the conditions that the country is in," Pino said. Even so, Honduran officials were hailing the more modest agreement as vital to the Honduran economy.
MCAT	Germany's IBIS DAX index of German shares ended the day in positive territory on Wednesday, but the prospect of further gains this week was ruled out by a market rendered jittery after a long period of record highs. "It's not particularly hectic out there at the moment, but then these are nervous times. We've got a meeting of the Federal Reserve next week and the British elections coming up to make everyone jittery," a trader said. The 30-share IBIS DAX index ended electronic trade at 3,305.72 points, up 16.13 points or 0.49 percent, while DTB DAX futures were up 13.5 points at 3,309 points. "The triple-witching later this week also makes the market very superficial and any gains tend to be based on movements in derivatives," the trader said. Traders said that weaker performances on Wall Street were also dampening sentiment, but said the current slow-down or correction was "not unhealthy". "People will pick up stocks on the way down," a trader said. Among shares in the news was the engineering group Preussag AG, which ended up 18 marks at 459.80 marks, as merger mania in the steel/engineering group lifted the share 4.07 percent. Focus has centred on the steel industry since Fried. Krupp AG's launched a 13.6 billion mark takeover for Thyssen AG. Since then Krupp has proposed cooperation talks with Thyssen. The news also boosted Mannesmann AG, which ended up 18.50 marks at 641.50 marks. A slightly weaker dollar at 1.68 marks also impacted on sentiment. Shares in German drugs group Schering rose initially after it revised its sales and profits forecasts for 1997, fell amid afternoon profit taking, but re-emerged to end the day up 5.20 marks at 162.30 marks.

CCAT	Shares in Gandalf Technologies Inc lost about half their value at the opening in Toronto on Monday after resuming trading following news on Friday the company filed for creditor protection. The computer equipment maker tumbled 0.49 to 0.49 in brisk trading of more than 400,000 shares. Gandalf remained halted on Nasdaq. Money-losing Gandalf, based outside of Ottawa, said it would restructure and perhaps find a buyer. "There's no fundamental reason why any investor would want to own this stock," said one Gandalf watcher who declined to be identified. He added that only vulture funds would be interested in speculating on the company's future. Analysts have said that Gandalf might be acquired at its current value of about C$20 million, excluding debt, or that rivals would only be interested in snapping up equipment or parts of the business.

CCAT	German chemicals group Bayer AG said it would spend a record 3.7 billion marks ($2.2 billion) on research in 1997 and said it had a good dozen drugs in development with a sales potential from 10 billion marks. Bayer chief executive Manfred Schneider told a company meeting late on Wednesday that 2.5 billion marks of the research funds were earmarked for healthcare and agriculture. Additional funds would be spent on new product development as well as on marketing efforts. Schneider said 57 percent of Bayer's research budget was spent in Germany but that amount was expected to drop in the coming years. He said, however, that Bayer was not reducing its work in Germany, where it employs 60 percent of the 14,000 people at the company involved in research. Schneider also said Bayer would introduce in the next two years two new medicines, including one against septic shock. The product pipeline for plant protection and animal healthcare products was also full, he said, noting products under development for plant protection were expected to add a minimum 500 million marks in new sales. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.688 German Marks)
GCAT	French police said on Friday they were trying to sniff out the kidnappers of seven highly skilled truffle-dogs which disappeared in southern France at the height of the season for gathering the pungent and costly black fungus. "An investigation is in progress," a spokesman for the unit of para-military gendarmes based in tiny Pernes-les-Fontaines, in the Vaucluse department told Reuters. Police had no leads. Three of the valuable dogs had since turned up wandering the countryside after the kidnappers apparently released them but four were still missing. Town mayor Herve de Chiree called a meeting of truffle gatherers and law enforcement authorities this week to discuss how to combat the problem but came up with few practical ideas, an aide said. Among possible remedies were rewards for the dogs' return or equipping other dogs with electronic tracking devices on their collars. Truffle-dogs are used to detect the delectable and highly marketable fungus in the region's oak forests, where they grow buried in the ground. Years ago, pigs were used to hunt them out but dogs are now in favour, experts say. The police spokesman said they suspect truffle-hunters from a neighbouring area unwilling to put in the time and money required to train their own animals. A good truffle-dog requires a year or two of training and can cost up to 15,000 francs ($2,700). Truffles sell at the wholesale level for up to 1,600 francs per kg ($130 per lb).

MCAT	Wholesale prices for U.S. West Coast gasolines edged lower Monday, amid light trade and a weaker energy futures markets in New York, traders said. The day's downward price trend was influenced by a slight dip in August unleaded gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), which settled 0.01 cent a gallon to 60.04 cents. August crude, which expires Tuesday, fell nine cents a barrel to $19.18 cents. The lower prices reflected concerns of increasing supplies now that the United Nations and Iraq appear to have agreed on final terms for the oil-for-food deal, which will renew exports from the Middle East producer. LOS ANGELES: Traders offered July and August CARB gasoline to Los Angeles refineries at 58.50 cents and 59.50 cents a gallon, traders said, 0.50 cents under Friday. CARB diesel edged up slightly, to 56 and 57 cents a gallon, a half cent over Friday's levels. Shell Oil Co's refinery in Martinez, Calif, near San Francisco, was operating normally Monday following a extremely short fire in an asphalt making unit Saturday. The fire, extinguish within minutes, failed to disrupt production or supplies to custmers, a company spokesman said Monday.

GCAT	Zambian elections drew peacefully towards their close on Monday, marred by an opposition boycott and disapproval from Western donors who fear it was largely a cosmetic exercise in democracy. President Frederick Chiluba is set for a second term after barring a challenge from his only strong rival, "Father of the Nation" Kenneth Kaunda, whom he beat in the first free elections in 1991 on a free-market and democracy platform. Enraged, Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP) walked out of parliament and led a seven-party boycott of the presidential and parliamentary polls they call a farce. Chiluba, 53, voted in his Copperbelt region stronghold and Kaunda, 72, went to play his favourite sport, golf. Kaunda said he would call for the results to be annulled but would denounce violence as a means of change. "These people did more damage in five years than I did in 27," he told reporters aid as he teed off. "But violence is not my way." Voting, held up in many polling stations by bureaucratic bungles, was extended into the evening in some places to enable everyone queuing to vote. No official western observers came. Police said the day passed without much-feared violence. Final results were not due until Tuesday or Wednesday. "Turnout appears to have been very, very low," said UNIP central committee member Proff Desai. "It was hundreds rather than thousands at all of the polling stations I visited." State officials said voting was brisk despite a flawed registration system that omitted half the 4.6 million adults. "Voters in their numbers braved the rain to vote and are throwing election boycotts to the wind," state radio said. Kaunda, who led Zambia to independence from Britain in 1964 and founded a one-party state on African-Christian-socialist "humanism", was ruled out under a new constitution passed in May by Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) because his parents were not Zambian-born. They were from Malawi. Whatever the outcome of the vote, political strife and economic hardship are set to intensify. UNIP has launched a campaign of civil disobedience and predicted Chiluba's downfall within six months, assuming he beats his four remaining challengers who stood on Monday. Foreign donors, upset by the bar on Kaunda and by other political developments in what had been a model of African progress, have frozen aid which helped copper-rich but impoverished Zambia cope with its $6.4 billion external debt. "Many of the hard-won gains of the last five years of reform are now at risk from the donor freeze," said the Standard Chartered bank group's September report on Zambia. The World Bank says privatisation and economic reform in landlocked Zambia are second to none in Africa. After the vote donors will face a dilemma -- to watch Zambia's economic promise fade away; or to eat humble pie and resume aid, having failed, like South African President Nelson Mandela, to make Chiluba reopen dialogue with UNIP. Ironically most political analysts believe Chiluba would easily have beaten Kaunda in a free contest between the parties, which they said differ little on policy nowadays.
MCAT	German shares were lifted to new record levels on Monday on the back of the dollar's ongoing strength against the mark, but demand was weak as attention focused on Tuesday's U.S. Federal Open Market Committee. The blue chip DAX-30 index ended the floor session up 27.14 points, or 0.9 percent, at an all-time high of 3,062.29 while March DTB DAX futures were up 20.5 points at 3,069.5. Dealers warned that the gains were achieved on relatively thin volumes, mainly led by dollar-sensitive firms like Daimler-Benz AG as the U.S. currency traded firmly above 1.64 marks, but said the broader market was cautious. "The Bund (debt) market had already by last week factored in the impact of a small rise in interest rates. We think the outlook from this (FOMC) meeting will be neutral now," one trader said. Daimler advanced 3.60 marks, or three percent, to 119.10 marks while Siemens AG also gained three percent to 82.23 marks. A strong 1995/1996 earnings report pushed Metallgesellschaft stock up one mark to 33.80 marks. The diversified engineering and trading company reported an 86.4 percent rise in net earnings Shares in utilities Veba AG and RWE AG fell against the trend after a British newspaper report that Cable & Wireless Plc was planning to exit its telecom alliance with them. The Times earlier on Monday reported that the British group was looking to abandon its alliance with the two. Veba fell 90 pfennigs to 89.70 while RWE slipped 95 pfennigs to 68.35. Dealers said the report had prompted some profit-taking in the German utility sector that had recently been setting in after a strong bull run in the sector. Builder Hochtief lost early gains after denying a report that it planned to "pool" its 20 percent stake in rival Holzmann with a shareholding owned by Deutsche Bank in a bid to increase its control on its close competitor. Hochtief ended down 60 pfennigs at 66.10 while Holzmann rose six marks to 424. Software group SAP continued its rise after last week's strong 1996 figures, rising nine marks to 255.0.

MCAT	Gold prices traded in a narrow range on Monday in a market disappointed by the metal's failure to hold onto last week's rally gains. Platinum prices slumped to fresh three-year lows, while silver ticked slightly higher as U.S. traders covered short positions, dealers said. Gold was fixed slightly higher at $369.00, compared to $368.50 in the morning, although dealers said the market was cautiously bearish. "The market is a little shell-shocked after Friday. Everyone's watching the stock market as people are very much undecided what to do next," a dealer said. Prices had rallied on Friday as speculators anticipated a move of "hot" money on comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. But values turned lower from a high around $375 an ounce as financial markets regained confidence. "It's very disappointing that all the markets turned around after a real burst to the upside on Friday, especially gold, which has really given up the ghost," said another. In other markets, the U.S. dollar was higher and equities and bonds were firmer after key finance officials said Friday's global market nosedive was excessive. Silver ticked up some five cents from early Monday levels to $4.80/$4.82 an ounce, unchanged from Friday's London close. "There was some localised shortcovering from American market makers and a bit of fund buying," a dealer said. Platinum, which was hit by a bout of selling on Friday and continued to show signs of weakness, was trading at a small discount to gold. It was indicated at $368.00/$369.00 an ounce, after fixing below the $370 level for the first time since December 1, 1993. "There's been some two-way business today, with industrial demand and some fund and speculative selling," a dealer said. Platinum's decline was probably due to investment funds liquidating long platinum positions that had been held in a play on the gold-platinum spread, another said. Several dealers dismissed suggestions that sales by major producer Russia might be responsible for the decline. A senior Russian trade official in Tokyo noted early on Monday that Russia may be selling some platinum in Europe in a bid to fill export quotas approved for this year. Palladium was indicated up $1.00 at $116.50/$117.50. --Lida Poletz, London newsroom +44 171 542 2936

ECAT	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Monday it had approved a third annual structural adjustment loan for Uganda, for $68 million. The loan, which will be available in two equal instalments, will be used to support Uganda's economic program in 1996 and 1997, the IMF said in a statement. Uganda's macroeconomic objectives for 1996 and 1997 are to achieve real GDP growth of seven percent, contain inflation at five percent, limit the current account deficit and increase international reserves, the statement said. "The achievement of these objectives will require tight fiscal and monetary policies," it said. Under the plan, Uganda will continue to sell off public companies through auctions and public flotation and promote wider stock ownership, the IMF said. The loan was made under IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, which aims to help for IMF members that are undertaking economic reform programs to strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth prospects.

The shares will be repurchased, at times and amounts to be determined by management as market conditions and capital position warrant, in the open market at prevailing prices or through negotiated off-market transactions. Repurchased shares will be placed in treasury and may subsequently be reissued for the company's dividend reinvestment plans, employee stock purchase plan, 401(k) savings plan, stock option plans, and other general corporate purposes, Irwin Financial said in a news release. This repurchase program replaces one that the company has has been operating under since August 1994, in which it was authorized to repurchase up to 1.2 million shares. About one million shares, or 87.2 percent of the authorization, were repurchased under the previous program. Shares of Irwin Financial, which provides specialized financial services, were trading up 7/8 to 31. ((Chicago newsdesk 312 408 8787))
CCAT	German chemicals group Hoechst AG has signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture with Thai Petrochemical Industry Plc to produce polypropylene in Thailand, company sources said. The companies are set to sign an agreement in February in which Trespaphan GmbH, Hoechst's polypropylene film subsidiary, will hold a 51 percent stake. TPI would hold 49 percent, they told Reuters on Thursday. The companies would jointly invest in building a new plant at TPI's existing facilities in eastern Rayong to produce 25,000 tonnes of polypropylene a year, the majority of which will be exported to ASEAN countries, the sources said. TPI's propylene cracker would be on stream in February and provide raw material for the polypropylene production joint venture, TPI executives said. Investment costs and likely starting date have yet to be disclosed. Polypropylene is used primarily in wrapping products.
MCAT	The Commodity Credit Corp said it bought 7,000 tonnes U.S. soybean meal for donation to Nicaragua.

GCAT	Scarcely can a man's absence and silence have been more noticeable: east Zaire is in crisis, the U.N. has lost contact with 500,000 refugees on the run and aid agencies are scrambling to find a way out. But away from all these troubles, Zaire's stricken leader Mobutu Sese Seko is living in luxury in one of the world's most exclusive hotels on the shores of Lake Geneva in the Swiss town of Lausanne where he is undergoing cancer treatment. The 66-year-old Zairean president, in Switzerland since August, and his entourage of more than 20 bodyguards and aides, have occupied part of the fourth-floor suites at the glamorous neo-Baroque Beau-Rivage Palace hotel in Lausanne. "He's here. He's upstairs. He rarely comes out of his room," a hotel employee whispered on Wednesday when pressed by visiting journalists about Mobutu's movements. Mobutu has yet to comment publicly on the reports of looting, fighting, refugees on the run and towns changing hands in the east of his vast, anarchic Central Afican country -- which diplomats say is under serious threat of disintegration. Swiss secrecy and discreet security surround him. His rare sightings include brief visits to the University Hospital where he underwent prostate cancer surgery on August 22 and those at gourmet restaurants in town. When Mobutu, who stands six feet (1.8 metres) tall, ventures out, he is noticeable by his trademark leopardskin fur hat, witnesses say. Mobutu has installed his own Zairean telephone operator at the hotel. His prime minister Kengo wa Dondo was here for a visit only last week. U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has telephoned him in the past few days. Hotel officials say Mobutu has been having some surprising visitors lately. They said former French interior minister Charles Pasqua paid an informal visit to the president on Tuesday. "He just showed up," said one. "And there are plenty of others." Pasqua's office confirmed he was in Switzerland on Tuesday but gave no details. Mobutu, a pariah banned from much of Western Europe and the United States, has more than $4 billion stashed away in Swiss bank accounts, according to Swiss media reports. Swiss media estimate the hotel bill for Mobutu and his entourage at close to two million Swiss francs ($1.6 million) and say they have been made to pay in advance. Mobutu's personal suite at the hotel, at times occupied by monarchs including Spain's King Juan Carlos and Jordan's King Hussein, was priced at 2,400 swiss francs ($2,000) a night. "He's our client, just like any other client," hotel manager Christian Marich told Reuters. "Mobutu has a lot of visitors. We respect his privacy." Marich said there were no special food deliveries for Mobutu. The president often dined on fish and fried potatoes, he said. "There's no champagne, no caviar, nothing special -- just grilled fish and fried potatoes," he said. Meanwhile, discontent is growing over Mobutu's presence among Swiss residents and politicians who say they want the dictator out. Parliamentarian Joseph Zisyadis told Reuters that local deputies were ready to vote for a motion asking the Swiss federal government to push Mobutu out of Lausanne. "It's a scandal. This dictator starves his people, his country is in war and this dictator speaks about his country's situation from our own country," said an angry Zisyadis.
ECAT	Failure to make progress on structural reforms of Japan's economy would raise concerns about the future direction of economic growth, Economic Planning Agency (EPA) Minister Shusei Tanaka told a news conference on Friday.   Tanaka, a member of the reformist Sakigake Party who lost his seat in the Lower House election last Sunday, is an ardent advocate of deregulation. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which fell 12 seats short of a majority in the Lower House election, is struggling to form a coalition to gain a majority, but it remains unclear whether it will succeed. Analysts fear deregulation and structural reform will not pick up speed under any new LDP-led government.   Tanaka, asked if he was aware of worries about the economy reflected in the decline in long-term interest rates, said the government had not changed its view, which is that the economy is on a gradual recovery path. "The reason we challenged the issue of economic structural reform from before the election was due to a strong sense of the urgency of reform. If deregulation proceeds, capital investment will emerge," he said. "If economic structural reform does not make progress, there is concern about the future of the economy."
ECAT	The Philippines' reserve money (RM) grew by 13 percent in June, lower than the 18 percent expansion allowed under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, the Central Bank said on Friday. "Latest Central Bank preliminary data on RM showed an overperformance of more than 10 billion pesos in June," a Central Bank statement said. The reserve money, which includes money in circulation and reserve balances of banks with the Central Bank, grew by 11 percent in May.   The Central Bank also said the year-on-year domestic liquidity (M3) growth was tempered at 17.5 percent in April, resulting in a level 36 billion pesos lower than the programmed ceiling. "We shall remain watchful on any possible pressure on inflation particularly on the demand side. We shall continue to look at the core inflation and that liquidity growth will be significantly more prudent than what is programmed," the statement added. The statement came hours after the National Statistics Office announced that June inflation rose to 4.8 percent from 4.2 percent in May. The Central Bank said the 4.8 percent inflation was lower than the 6.4 percent set under the IMF programme. Analysts said inflationary pressure might be heightened in the coming months following the speculative attack on the Philippine peso. The Central Bank raised its benchmark overnight rate to 24 percent from 15 percent to ward off currency speculators on Wednesday following Thailand's de facto devaluation. "(The) recent interest rate policy initiatives are temporary. There should be no spillover effects on investments and production as to impinge on the supply side and stoke inflationary pressures," the Central Bank added. -- Manila Newsroom (63 2) 841-8938 Fax 817-6267
GCAT	Following are the main stories in Monday's Malaysian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. NEW STRAITS TIMES -- The Anti-Corruption Agency has arrested 16 people in Kuala Lumpur this year on various charges. Most of them were policemen and City Hall staff. -- Economists are divided over the trend in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange for the rest of the year. Some say good earnings growth, a stable ringgit and better-than-expected current account deficit would be positive surprises aiding a rally in the stock market. But, others said a negative sentiment would continue to prevail over the next few months due to a bleak economic outlook. THE STAR -- Bank Negara has indicated to local banks to consider shortening the period allowed for classifying loans as non-performing to three months from six after a default occurs. BUSINESS TIMES -- Ringgit will not be allowed to depreciate very much to prevent an erosion in international competitiveness. This would help keep import costs down and force manufacturers to improve productivity. -- Kuala Lumpur newsroom (603-201 4813)
MCAT	The Mauritian rupee weakened against the dollar and pound on Monday in line with international market trends, foreign exchange dealers said. The rupee was posted at a mean commercial rate of 20.084 against the dollar from 20.061 last Friday. Against the pound, the rupee traded at a mean of 32.727 from 32.675 last Friday. Dealers said the weaker rupee on Monday reflected a stronger dollar in overnight international markets. "Several banks are still long in their forex positions. Importers are slowly coming back after the dead season at the end of the year but demand (from importers) is expected to recover to normal levels only after January," a dealer said. The present long forex positions in banks are a result of good foreign exchange supplies from the island's textiles and tourism sectors offsetting low importer demand, dealers said.
MCAT	Raw cotton buyers in Europe tended to sit and wait for prices to move, and sellers were also wary on a view that supplies of some qualities may be hard to find in the summer and autumn. But more West African was traded, including Mali styles in Italy. And spinners who need cotton for blending with West African descriptions, in replacement for Central Asian which is now difficult to find, are likely to pay more attention to Australian descriptions. A surplus of Syrian also remains for sale. Little interest has been commanded yet by offers of US (notably Texan higher grades) which have become unfamiliar to users in recent years.
ECAT	Sweden's December current account surplus is expected at a 2.1 billion crown ($282.2 million), a Reuters poll of 13 analysts showed on Wednesday. Forecasts ranged from surpluses of 600 million to four billion crowns, and the median is two billion crowns for the December current account figures, due at 1100 GMT on Friday. December's balance of trade came in at 9.6 billion crowns. From January to November, the current account surplus rose to 44.5 billion crowns. Including the December surplus, the 1996 figure is expected to be 46.6 billion crowns. In November, the current account surplus stood at 6.3 billion crowns. December 1995 posted a deficit of 700 million crowns, with the 1995 total coming in at a surplus of 35.4 billion crowns. Sources participating in this poll were Aragon, Carnegie, Den Danske Bank, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Hagstromer & Qviberg, Handelsbanken, HSBC Midland, Nomura, Nordbanken, PaineWebber, S-E-Banken, Transferator and Ohmans. -- Barbara Taltavull, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1019 ($ = 7.441 Swedish Crowns)

MCAT	Reuters said Friday it calculated its 30-day visible supply of upcoming municipal bond sales at $6.048 billion, off $35 million from Thursday. Negotiated sales total $3.876 billion in 67 issues and competitive bond sales total $2.171 billion in 143 issues. Reuters visible supply counts all deals underwriters have either scheduled for sale in the next 30 business days, or have said they tentatively plan to price during the period. The supply figure is based on sales data compiled by Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group and uses municipal securities with maturities 13 months or longer. All bond deals $1 million or larger are included. --U.S. Municipal Desk, 212-859-1650
ECAT	Silf and Swedbank said on Tuesday that their purchasing managers' index was unchanged at 55.5 in March, the same level as February.   "The upturn in the industrial cycle is continuing accordingly but without further acceleration," Silf and Swedbank said in a statement. The index in January was 53.3 and in March 1996 46.4. The statement said the order intake was continuing to show a divided picture but was still better in the first quarter of 1997 than in the same period a year ago with positive developments. The index for order intake was 57.0 in March against 59.4 in February but compared to 47.0 in March last year. "It is still orders from exports that are dragging while the home market is not far from becoming stagnant," they said. Silf and Swedbank said the most negative aspect in March was still falling employment. "Despite increased production, unemployment in the industrial sector continues to fall," the statement said. The production index rose to 59.7 in March against 59.4 in Feburary and 50.0 a year earlier. -- Belinda Goldsmith, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1017

MCAT	Overnight volatility on Wall Street and a see-sawing response to key U.S. economic data in the afternoon unsettled the German share market on Wednesday, and prices finally ended the day at lower levels. The IBIS DAX index, which tracks all-day screen dealings in German blue chips, closed the day down 30.32 points at 2,997.95, having swung to highs of over 3,000 points and a low of 2,978 in a turbulent U.S.-driven afternoon session. Earlier, the DAX index, which was catching up on a surge in late screen trading Tuesday, ended floor trade at 2,999.20, 9.87 points higher than Tuesday's mid-afternoon close. Dealers said orders were thin and investors confused as to how to judge the U.S. economy. The afternoon's inconclusive reaction by other markets to what appeared to be soft durable goods order data from the U.S. added to market nerves. "Frankly, I don't know what to make of it and nor does anyone else," said a Frankfurt trader. "Those looked like encouraging numbers but we still saw Bunds shoot up and plunge back down. It's only natural investors will be cautious." The weaker dollar also weighed on prices. Bank shares remained under pressure, with Deutsche Bank ending the day down 2.20 marks at 82.45 while Commerzbank AG extended its decline after Tuesday's below-forecast earnings report for 1996 to end down 87 pfennigs at 42 marks. Preference shares in software company SAP AG dropped as much as 4.8 percent to 220 marks as doubts emerged that the company could meet its own forecasts for 1996 sales and earnings. SAP is due to release 1996 data on Friday. And chemical shares, which gained in earlier trade as the sector caught up on a recent switch to exporters, turned lower in late trade. BASF AG ended down 39 pfennigs at 59.71 marks while Bayer AG dropped 10 pfennigs to 62.23 marks.
GCAT	An awe-inspiring display of power and precision earned Pete Sampras his fourth Wimbledon title on Sunday when he crushed Frenchman Cedric Pioline 6-4 6-2 6-4 in one hour 34 minutes. The 25-year-old world number one, winner here from 1993 to 1995, lost only a handful of points against his own thumping serve and pressured Pioline's deliveries, with inch-perfect returns. Pioline, 28, and the first Frenchman to reach the Wimbledon singles final since Yvon Petra in 1946, was forced into a string of volley errors by the sheer power of the American's ground strokes. The 44th-ranked Frenchman, watched by his wife Mireille on her first visit to London, did produce some delicate touches -- an exquisite lob and several passes down the line -- but he was no match for Sampras. Sampras, a consummate grasscourt player who dropped his serve just twice in seven matches at the championships, broke Pioline's serve once in the first set, twice in the second and once in the third. There was never any question who was in charge. It was the American's 10th grand slam win. He needs two more to equal Australian Roy Emerson's grand slam record.
ECAT	The Indian government said on Wednesday that a tightening of monetary policy in 1995/96 (April-March) may have been too sharp, and cautioned against easing too much now. "There is reason to believe that the tightening of monetary policy in 1995/96, to counter the inflationary effect of the surge in capital inflows and the resulting faster monetary growth in the previous year, may have been too sharp," the government said in its annual Economic Survey. It said monetary policy had since been brought adjusted in 1996/97 to bring it into line with targets which it said are still valid. "We must now be careful to avoid over-compensating in the opposite direction by easing money supply too far above the target level, and thus building up inflationary pressures for the next year," it said. "Any short-term temptation of depending solely on monetary policy to solve problems arising from other policy imperatives should be avoided," it said. -- New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024
CCAT	The Polish government is likely to free prices of drugs as of next year, which may lift them by about 40 percent but it is necessary to complete the pharmaceutical sector's privatisation, a newspaper reported. On Wednesday Gazeta Wyborcza daily quoted deputy health minister Wojciech Kusmierkiewicz as saying that the government is likely to decide in June on freeing prices of some 30 percent of drugs which remain officially controlled. "We may consider freeing drug prices in two stages so as not to hit people's pockets," Kusmierkiewicz was quoted as saying. Polish drug makers say the liberalisation is necessary to complete the privatisation of the pharmaceutical sector, which has so far involved only two companies -- Polfa Kutno and Jelfa. The government plans to sell five more companies from the sector this year, with public tenders for Polfa Rzeszow and Polfa Krakow already opened and tenders for Polfa Poznan, Polfa Starogard and Polfa Tarchomin planned later this year. Zycie Warszawy daily quoted deputy treasury minister Andrzej Peczak as confirming earlier reports that Polfa Kutno and Jelfa were bidding for Rzeszow and Krakow. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700

GCAT	Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hizbollah claimed responsibility for Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel which wounded at least one civilian and caused some damage early on Tuesday. "The Islamic Resistance declares openly that it shelled the settlements in north occupied Palestine with a number of Katyusha rockets, causing many casualties," a Hizbollah (Party of God) spokesman told Reuters. Dozens of Katyusha rockets fired from Lebanon slammed into northern Israel early on Tuesday, wounding at least one civilian and causing some damage, witnesses said. The attack just after 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) occurred a day after violence in Lebanon, some of it involving pro-Israeli militia, killed at least nine civilians. Timor Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL), told Reuters that about 80 Katyusha rockets were fired from several locations in south Lebanon and some had landed in northern Israel.

ECAT	The World Bank will grant a $24 million loan to Croatia to rebuild war-shattered infrastructure in the hinterland of the southern Adriatic city of Dubrovnik, a newspaper reported on Sunday. The loan is to finance five projects, including rebuilding of the water supply and sewerage system in the Dubrovnik area and the region bordering southern Bosnia, Vjesnik daily quoted visiting World Bank officials as saying. It did not mention any terms or when the loan would be approved. The historic city of Dubrovnik was heavily bombed during Croatia's minority Serbs uprising following the country's secession from federal Yugoslavia in 1991. -- Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075
ECAT	Inflation expectations among Polish banks eased again in February, a monthly Reuter poll of the 24 biggest banks showed on Monday. Banks predicted average year-on-year inflation for the end of 1997 to be 16.17 percent, down from 16.23 percent predicted last month but well above the government's prediction of 13 percent. Forecasts ranged between 14.60 and 18.80 percent. Banks predicted monthly inflation this month against January would be 1.65 percent on average with a range of forecasts from 0.9 percent to 2.8 percent. Banks predicted year-on-year inflation in February 1998 at an average 15.77 percent, with the range from 13.0 to 18.70 percent. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700
GCAT	Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, facing a hostile parliament, defended Russia's latest cabinet changes on Friday, saying they were aimed at restoring order in the economy and would help embattled national industries. "The changes in the government have been prompted by the needs of the current stage of economic reforms," Chernomyrdin told the State Duma lower house, explaining last Monday's wholesale cabinet reshuffle. The reshuffle was ordered by President Boris Yeltsin, who blasted the cabinet for failing to end delays in wages and pensions which led to worsening social tensions in the country. "One of the main tasks now is to restore order in the financial sphere and in the budget, which means to restore order in paying wages, pensions and normalising the system of payments," Chernomyrdin told the Duma. The Duma was angered by Yeltsin's decision to give top cabinet posts to reformers, including his chief of staff Anatoly Chubais -- a hated figure among Russian conservatives and communists -- whom he made first deputy prime minister. The Duma demanded explanations from Chernomyrdin on the government changes. But the communist-dominated chamber has stopped short of demanding the government's resignation or even urging the Kremlin to back down on the reshuffle. Conservative deputies were however alarmed by promises by new cabinet members to give a new push to radical market reform and to scrap the remnants of paternalistic welfare, one of the last vestiges of the Communist past. "It will be difficult, it will be painful but we cannot let fortunes leak into sewage," Chernomyrdin said, defending inevitable increases in housing and municipal service charges planned by his government. Chernomyrdin said though that the planned welfare reform would take place in stages and would include a safety net for the poor. Chernomyrdin told the Duma in an hour-long address that the reshuffle would end by early next week and would not involve the so-called "power ministers" -- Defence, Interior and the head of the Federal Security Service, part of the former KGB. "There will be no personnel changes in any power structures now," he told the Duma. Parliamentary conservatives were alarmed by Yeltsin's decision to scrap some ministries, including the Industry Ministry, which they argued would lead to a collapse of Russian industrial capability. Chernomyrdin said that enterprises, most of which have been privatised, no longer needed many of the Soviet-style ministries.

GCAT	Florida will gain nearly four million residents from other states in the next 30 years, while births and immigration will add another 2.5 million people, according to a report published Thursday in Tampa Tribune. That would bring the state's population to 20.7 million by 2025, according to the report based on U.S. Census data and compiled by University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research. The report projects Florida will get nearly twice as many residents from other states as Texas, which is projected to be the second most popular relocation spot. If the forecast is accurate, Florida would become the nation's third most populous state by 2015, surpassing New York nearly five years earlier than previously expected. California and Texas would still be the first and second most populous states, the report projects. "Urban and suburban areas are going to continue to spread," said Stanley Smith, director of the university research bureau. "Roads are going to become more crowded, bigger or both. There will be fewer and fewer unoccupied areas. Public places will become more crowded - beaches, parks, recreation areas." The projected influx could strain environmental and government resources, but would still fall short of the boom that marked the last 30 years, when Florida's population grew by 8.2 million. Nor would the influx be all negative, said Smith, who predicts it would result in a rapidly growing economy, rising property values and new industrial and cultural opportunities. Florida's public schools, which have been growing at the rate of 60,000 new students a year, will get a bit of a breather. The report projects that growth will begin to taper off next year and slow through 2004, then flatten out through 2010 before increasing again. --Jane Sutton, 305-374-5013
GCAT	New York State Gov. George Pataki on Wednesday, confirming weeks of speculation, said that he only plans to recall the legislature for a special session if it appears likely that it will approve new welfare reforms. While New York State in mid-October submitted an outline of its welfare program to Washington, in order to fully qualify for an estimated $2.4 billion block grant, the Republican governor has been working on a fuller plan. New York, like most states, must revise its current system to comply with the new federal welfare program, which imposes stiff new limits, including work requirements and lifetime time limits, that became law in August. The governor, who has said that the welfare reform, one of the most expensive and difficult issues facing the state, was complicating the budget process, on Wednesday said he had not yet decided whether he will submit a budget in December. Saying he hoped to send the legislature detailed welfare proposals over the next few weeks, Pataki at a news conference in New York City said, "I'll only call them back if we have agreement or close to an agreement to achieve passage of welfare reform legislation." The Democrat-led Assembly blocked the changes to the welfare system that Pataki had proposed in his 1997 fiscal budget, saying they were too harsh, and there are concerns the lower house again might reject some of the governor's plans. However, Pataki might already have resolved at least some of the initial objections raised by the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, according to sources in Albany. Spokesmen for the Assembly and Senate were not immediately available to comment. The governor, who led a bipartisan effort to win the voters' approval for a $1.75 billion bond act that will raise funds to clean up the state's air, water and land, said he hoped both parties would support the new welfare program. Pataki, who said he expected informal negotiations between staff members instead of formal talks on welfare, was guarded about the prospects for success. "I think there's a reasonable chance of getting it done. There's also a chance it won't get done, but we're going to try," he said. --Joan Gralla, 212-859-1654

ECAT	Hungary's finance minister said that in 1998 Hungary will maintain overall public spending at current levels in real terms, with above-inflation increases for public investment and agricultural subsidies. "Preserving the real value of (government) expenditure is a realistic target but in two areas -- public investment and agricultural subsidies -- spending should rise at a larger pace than inflation," Peter Medgyessy told the Hungarian daily Nepszava in an interview published on Saturday. He said public investment could rise by as much as 12 percent in real terms while agricultural subsidies would rise by inflation plus the equivalent of 1998 GDP growth -- which the government currently forecasts at four to five percent, after a two to three percent rise in 1997. Medgyessy said no overall real increase in the central budget will be necessary to cover extra spending in the chosen sectors. "These two items account for 10 percent of the whole government budget which means that from the remaining 90 percent it is easy to redirect funds to cover the increases," he said, adding that government spending on education would be maintained. He said the increase in public investments, including infrastructure, would result in subsequent savings to the central budget. "If we manage to raise public investments by 10 to 12 percent in real terms it will bring in 30 billion forints worth of surplus financing," he said. Regarding inflation policy, Medgyessy said the government was likely to adopt the less harsh of two alternative strategies he will put to the cabinet within the next couple of weeks. One of the scenarios envisages year-on-year price growth falling below 10 percent by December 1998 from current levels of around 19 percent, while the alternative proposal would see an end-1998 inflation figure of up to three percentage points higher. Medgyessy, who earlier this week told Reuters he saw end-1997 year-on-year inflation as low as 16 to 17 percent, told the Nepszava that a "strained reduction" to 10 percent by the following year could inhibit GDP growth. He said the less radical inflation cut programme was likely to be better for the economy as a whole. "I think there is a larger chance that an average yearly reduction of four to five percentage points can be sustained," he said. Medgyessy also said he was against any softening of fiscal policy ahead of elections due in spring 1998. "I have a principle according to which only those governments which do not have confidence in themselves make (tax) concessions ahead of elections." Medgyessy also said he would stand down as finance minister after the elections, whatever the result. "My aim is to lead the ministry until the elections and I have already said that after 1998 I do not wish to continue to play a political role." "Two of my main targets have been reached: the balance of the economy has improved further and signs of economic growth can already be seen," he said. He also described the recent government approval of the pension reform plan as a breakthrough. "I would have resigned if the plan had not been approved." The drastic overhaul of Hungary's pension system was passed by the cabinet at the end of last month and is due to go before parliament shortly. Under the plan, Hungary would retain parts of its antiquated pay-as-you-go system and would also add modern fully funded components. -- Budapest newsroom +361 327 3030

GCAT	Over 1,000 people in southwestern Angola have fled their villages over the past two days because of unrest in the area, aid officials said on Sunday. "Violence in this region has been endemic for some time, but this is on a different scale," an aid group director in the city of Lubango told Reuters. A column of people, mainly from the village of Yambala, started arriving in the city of Cubal in Benguela province on Saturday, aid workers said. The city already hosts some 120,000 people displaced by Angola's two-decade-long civil war. The refugees did not tell aid workers who was reponsible for the unrest but spoke of villages being set on fire and of scores injured in attacks. "It's a very confusing situation at the moment. It is impossible to say exactly how many people have arrived in Cubal but our people there say more than 1,500," said Catherine Quillet of the medical aid group Medecins Sans Frontiers, from her home in Luanda. "We know the refugees walked about 10 hours to get to Cubal from Yambala. They are saying their villages were burned down by men who were wearing uniforms. Whether these men are UNITA or government troops or someone else, we don't know," she said. The area around Yambala used to be controlled by the former UNITA rebel movement but has recently come under the control of locally organised civil defence units who are supported by the government, according to aid workers and other officials there. Some reports suggest that renegade UNITA troops have moved back into the area to try to establish their influence. The area around Cubal and Yambala has historically been one of Angola's most unstable areas. A highway linking the Atlantic port of Benguela, and running through Cubal to the highland city of Huambo, is known as dangerous with "regular" and renegade troops from both sides. Officials say the unrest in Benguela underlines the deep problems that Angola still has to overcome to effectively end a civil war that erupted between the government and UNITA movement in 1975 after independence from Portugal. The two sides signed a peace accord in the Zambian capital Lusaka in 1994 but a formal ending of hostilities and the establishment of a unity government have yet to be implemented. "This unrest is nothing new but it is disturbing, especially at a time when we are trying to bring about official government administration to these areas," an official close to the peace process told Reuters. "This is a sign that what is happening here in Luanda -- the progress we are making in the peace process -- has not extended to the grassroots level," he said. "At that level there is still a lot of tension, still very much a struggle for control."

CCAT	Zeneca Group Plc's first-half results were welcomed by analysts on Thursday, despite a bout of jitters in early trading which saw the shares fall by more than 50 pence at one point. "They were extremely good and came in at the upper end of forecasts," said Merrill Lynch analyst James Culverwell. "Their comments on margins in the second half have really been flagged over the past two years, so it should be in everybody's forecasts." Culverwell said he was maintaining his forecast for full-year pre-tax profit at 1.090 billion stg. By midafternoon shares in Zeneca had recovered to trade down just 2 1/2 pence at 20.41 1/2 stg. "Overall the underlying performance is looking pretty good," said Dresdner Kleinwort Benson analyst Steve Puttnam. "The market got spooked about currency and launch costs," said Puttnam, who has shaved 20 million stg off his full-year forecast to bring it to 1.055 billion stg, reflecting the expense of drug launches.   Puttnam also praised the way Zeneca handled concerns about new asthma pill Accolate, which caused flutters last week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended a change in labelling because of a possible link to six cases of a rare asthma-related condition known as Churg-Strauss Syndrome. "It is really nothing to do with Accolate at all," he said. Daiwa's Keegan added; "I think the concerns about Accolate have been put to rest." Analysts were also pleased with the performance of the group's new wide-ranging fungicide Amistar, used on everything from crops to golf courses. The product notched up 45 million stg of sales in the first half, and chief executive Sir David Barnes told Reuters he expected sales of at least 150 million stg next year. "American Home Products recently indicated that the fungicide market was dull, and despite that Zeneca's fungicide is doing very well," Puttnam said. -- Jonathan Birt, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
CCAT	Philips Electronics NV said on Wednesday it was further loosening ties with its Grundig unit, a move welcomed by analysts as reducing its exposure to the loss-making German consumer electronics firm. Philips said it would act as a passive minority shareholder and from 1997 would account for Grundig's results only on a pro-rata basis related to its 32 percent stake, ending its previous 100 percent consolidation policy. "We have given up our control over Grundig," said Philips spokesman Ben Geerts. "As a consequence we are deconsolidating Grundig, that means we only consolidate 32 percent of any losses during 1997," he said. Shares in Europe's biggest consumer electronics firm rose 2.30 guilders, or 3.31 percent, to 71.70 guilders, outpacing a 0.82 percent rise in the AEX index of leading Dutch shares. "It means that the results improvement at the consumer products division, at which Grundig used to be 100 percent consolidated, is going to have a significant boost for 1997," said Van Meer James Capel analyst Joost van Beek.  Philips said it was making the move as part of its policy to present a single brand in world markets and because of the negative returns from its investment in Grundig. "From 1984 until December 31, 1995, Philips lost over 1.5 billion marks ($955 million) on Grundig," said Geerts. Analysts said Wednesday's move was positive and showed the commitment of Philips chairman Cor Boonstra to deal with what he has called the company's loss-making bleeders.  "I guess it's another bit of evidence that things are happening sooner rather than later," said Schroders analyst Susan Anthony in London.  But Anthony said the market might be over-reacting somewhat to the news and, while Philips was attacking loss makers, it still had to show it could give consumers what they wanted. "In a sense the cost-cutting part is the easier part...but to drive earnings growth in the future you really do need to see consumer electronics becoming a significant contributor," she added, which meant Philips had to turn its developments into comm ercial successes and get a return from them.  In February last year Philips said that from January 1, 1997 it would stop automatically reimbursing Grundig for its losses. "The essence of what we announced last February was we gave up...the commitment to automatically reimburse Grundig's losses. We remained economically responsible for their losses," said Geerts. The German company, famous for its televisions and hi-fi equipment, lost 250 million marks in 1996 and is seen by analysts as making a loss of about 135 million marks in 1997. Geerts said Philips was in talks to unwind its contractual relationship with the Max Grundig Foundation, to which it pays a 50 million guilder ($28.5 million) a year dividend and which holds an option to sell Philips the 68 percent of Grundig it does not already own. Since 1994 Philips has been making an 11 million guilder per quarter provision to buy out the Grundig stake by 2004, which analysts say could provide a war chest in any pay-off it might make to get out of the contract with the foundation. Van Beek said he was raising his 1997 earnings estimate for Philips following the Grundig news to 6.75 guilders per share from his previous 6.50 guilders forecast. Grundig on Wednesday said it would seek new partners and hold a news conference on Friday to give further details. Asked about Philips's plans for its Grundig stake, spokesman Geerts said: "We are not planning to sell our Grundig stake, but one day someone could show up and ask us if we were willing to sell and then we would judge that at that moment."

MCAT	Argentine stocks closed lower in volatile trading Thursday but traders expected the market to find its feet early next week. "Cash flows were too weak to sustain the rise after the market touched a new five-year high," said Miguel Daneri at brokers Boston Securities. "People got scared when they saw the U.S. long bond yield climb above 6.5 percent, which shows that's not a resistance level. But I think this pause won't last beyond Monday." The blue-chip MerVal index shed 0.9 percent to 849.88, skidding off a session high of 860.22.   The MerVal, which had closed at a five-year high of 857 Wednesday, trimmed gains in the week to 1.1 percent. "There's no doubt the bolsa was affected by the poor performance of the U.S. markets today," another trader said. "Prices are struggling higher these days, but because valuations are high, it seems each upward thrust is followed by a moderate correction." Floor volume fizzled again to 31 million pesos from Wednesday's strong tally of 42.8 million, while over-the-counter turnover slowed to 103.9 million pesos from 129.1 million Wednesday.   The broad market index shed 0.6 percent, with losers outpacing winners 31 to 21 and 23 issues closing flat. Heaviest main-tier losers were steelmaker Siderca, which fell 2.9 percent, and textile and footwear firm Alpargatas, foods giant Molinos Rio de la Plata and holding company Comercial del Plata, all off 2.2 percent. MerVal gainers were led by pulp and paper maker Celulosa, cement stock Juan Minetti and carmaker Ciadea, which tacked on 4.9 percent, 1.9 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively.

CCAT	Air Mauritius head Harry Tirvengadum is undecided whether to take up an offer of the post of chief executive of ailing Air Afrique, a Mauritius newspaper said on Wednesday. Tirvengadum, who is Air Mauritius chairman and managing director, was offererd the top job on Monday at a summit in Abidjan of member states of the debt-ridden multinational airline. L'Express said Tirvengadum had told fellow directors of his airline he would have a series of consultations before taking a decision on the Air Afrique job. "Because of his engagements at the regional and international levels, he does not intend to take a decision before the end of the year," L'Express said. Tirvengadum has not responded to a Reuters invitation to comment on his appointment. He was among candidates from a list presented by an international management consultant. Sources at the Abidjan talks said they included a French and a Belgian national. Tirvengadum would replace Frenchman Yves-Roland Billecart, whose mandate at the head of the struggling airline was cut short by the 11 Francophone member states. Billecart's job, chairman and mangaing director, will be split between the new chief executive and a chairman to be chosen at the next meeting of the company's board.
MCAT	Northern Europe rapeseed prices rose as poor harvests in some countries left buyers without sufficient supply while farmers hoarded large volumes, brokers said on Friday. "Farmers sold about 30-35 percent of the new crop in pre-harvest contracts, but the rest won't be available for some time to come," one said. "Normally, this would cause price rallies but it is being offset by weak demand for oil and good rapeseed harvests in France and Britain." Buyers free Hamburg offered 470 marks/tonne, five marks more than last week and 30 marks more than six weeks ago. Subsequent delivery prices should rise four marks a tonne per month until December. Canadian canola was offered at $340 but was uncompetitive in small quantities. One broker estimated some 100,000 tonnes had been sold from Canada's ample new crop into Europe but the anticipated heavy canola influx here would take another four to six weeks to develop. With Scandinavian and Polish processors in short supply, brokers believed prices had some upside potential short term. They also cited the strong dollar versus the mark and reasonable meal demand. Sellers might be reactivated if rapeseed reached 480 marks. Rapeseed buyers at points other than Hamburg offered five to 10 marks more for September than last week, with bids in a 455-470 marks range. The November position on the Paris Matif futures exchange last traded two marks above last night's close at 475 marks. Local rape meal sellers quoted Sept/October meal (34 percent protein) at 28.75-29.00 marks/100 kg, up 0.25-0.50 on last week, while Nov/Jan was up 0.25 at 28.50 marks. In comparison, spot soymeal cost 45.50-45.75 marks (44 percent protein). Sept, Oct and Nov-Jan rape oil were each up 2.75 marks at 88.75, 89 and 91 marks respectively. --Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275
GCAT	A Jordanian soldier charged with murdering seven Israeli schoolgirls had a history of mental disturbance and once attempted suicide after a row with his mother, a military court heard on Monday. Doctor Nabil al-Hmoud, a medical witness charged with examining the mental state of Private Ahmed Daqamsa after last March's shooting, told the court at first that the soldier had "disturbed personality traits," but was apparently not insane. The court referred Daqamsa for further mental tests by a panel of doctors to assess his state of mind. Daqamsa has not denied shooting the girls, six of them 13 years old and one just 11 years old, but says he acted impulsively after being provoked during Moslem prayers. He is charged with premeditated murder and faces a death sentence if found guilty. The prosecution say he had been planning to kill Israelis for many years but never got the opportunity until the incident. "After examining this person no psychotic or mental illness was apparent and on that basis I made him undergo personality tests," said Major Hmoud, a medical doctor at the state-run King Hussein Medical Centre. But under questioning by defence lawyer Hussein Majalli, Hmoud said in the interest of impartiality Daqamsa needed detailed medical examination on his state of mind. He told the court he was mandated by the military investigators only to verify whether Daqamsa was insane, not to examine in detail his emotional and psychological state. Hmoud revealed, in the most detailed personal profile of Daqamsa so far heard in court, a record of referrals for mental disturbance in the last few years. Daqamsa's hospital file showed he was treated in 1991 for severe emotional stress, with the psychologist even citing some indications of hysterical behaviour. In an earlier episode in 1989 he took an drug overdose in an apparent suicide attempt following a dispute with his mother. But in tests after the shooting the doctor could only say Daqamsa showed agitation and signs of insomnia and no signs of deeper mental anguish. Hmoud said Daqamsa was subjected to two brain scans and a personality test to check if he was psychotic. He said the tests could not reveal any signs of madness but however showed "personality disorders" which included "impulsive behaviour" and a stonger than normal sexual drive. "He is aware of all his actions, but his impulsiveness and his inability to control his actions make him less able than the normal person to control his behaviour," the medical witness said. Asked by chief prosecutor Muhanad Hijazi why Daqamsa shot female victims, Hmoud said:" After the personality test some symptoms show he is inclined to social introvertism and a leaning to sexual motives and some impulsiveness in behaviour." While the prosecution has been focusing on Daqamsa as a sexual deviant, defence lawyers want to portray him as a courageous man who lost his senses in a moment of rage at the behaviour of the Israeli girls.
CCAT	H.B. Fuller Co's North American adhesives unit said Wednesday it will raise prices four to six percent on its hot melt, water-based, and certain specialty adhesive product lines, effective April 30. The company said the price rise was due to price increases on many of the fundamental raw materials used in the formulation of the products, as well as supply and demand imbalances that exist with certain basic petrochemical feedstocks. H.B. Fuller fell 1-1/2 to 46-1/2 Wednesday. ((Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787))

MCAT	So much data, so little time; that's what the U.S. credit markets face this coming week with one trading session cancelled and two sessions shortened for Thursday's Thanksgiving Day holiday. After appetizers like the October existing home sales report Monday and weekly store sales and the Conference Board's November consumer confidence figures Tuesday, the market gets a data cornucopia Wednesday befitting a pre-Thanksgiving Day feast.   Third-quarter GDP was first reported to be 2.2 percent but a sizable drop in September wholesale inventories led economists polled by Reuters to conclude, on average, that the 2.2 percent figure will be revised downward to 1.7 percent. Jobless claims data for the week ended Nov 16 will also be served up at 0830 EST Wednesday. "Jobless claims will let us see whether this week's spike (up to 344,000 new claims) was a fluke or not," said Marrone. "Jobless claims have been the one item challenging the notion that we're in a broad-based slowdown," said James Glassman, vice president and economist at Chase Securities.   October durable goods orders, rescheduled for release Wednesday at 1000 EST, is like a recipe whose outcome is always in doubt. "Durable goods is so volatile," said Patrick Dimick, trader and Treasury market analyst at UBS Securities. "There are so many categories (of orders) that there's usually something in it for everybody." Economists Reuters polled estimated, on average, that durable goods fell 2.0 percent in October after jumping 4.9 percent in September. Without defense orders, they forecast a 2.2 percent orders drop after a 4.8 percent September rise.   Yet Lee Youngdahl, bond market analyst at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co, said durable goods is one of the two meatiest reports the market will get in the coming week. "The market often looks to the durable goods data for some leading information on the manufacturing sector," he said. The same is true of the November Chicago Purchasing Managers report, also due at 1000 EST, which the market will savor, trying to sift out some foretaste of the November National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) report due the Monday after the Thanksiving closure.   "The Chicago Purchasing Managers index is a good read on manufacturing conditions in the middle of the country and though there's no direct corelation to the NAPM, people do draw inferences," said Youngdahl. A little input from the consumer sector is also on tap for 1000 EST Wednesday from the University of Michigan's final November measure of consumer sentiment. "If high consumer confidence translates into strong retail sales at Christmas, that could be a damper on our expectations for lower interest rates," observed Greg Carr, market analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. Youngdahl said the only chance for a major market in the Thanksgiving week would come from "some change in perception (about the economy's direction) based either on the durable goods data or on the Chicago PMI." If weekly jobless claims were to stay near 340,000, that, too, could be viewed as more evidence of a slowing economy, he said. Trading will end three hours early Wednesday before the Thursday Thanksgiving holiday and will resume on Friday for another shortened session. The October personal income and consumption data, due Friday, will be viewed as slightly stale, analysts said, and thus unlikely to excite the market's palate. Conference Board's October Help-Wanted Advertising index and some Federal Reserve's money and banking figures are also certain to be market non-events. Trading desks will operate with skeletal staffs on Friday during a shortened trading session that will likely prove to be no more than a mildly inconvenient interruption of a long Thanksgiving Day holiday weekend. Dealers indicated Fed funds would open between 5-1/4 and 5-5/8 percent Monday. The 6benchmark -1/2 percent 30-year Treasury bond was down 9/32 at 100-25/32 to yield 6.44 percent in late Friday trade. --212-859-1679
MCAT	Strong demand from non-residents for long-dated GKO discount Treasury bills and OFZ government bonds will enable the Finance Ministry to place paper on Wednesday at or below market yields, dealers said on Tuesday. TOMORROW Finance Ministry sells: * 7.50 trillion roubles 364-day bills (series 23005) * 4.00 trillion rbls new 707-day new bond tranche (series 24011) Finance Ministry repays/pays: * 6.91 trillion roubles maturing 182-day bills (22055) * 246.86 billion roubles interest on 2-yr bond (24009) TODAY * Average yield fell to 30.5 from 31.7 percent * Turnover rose to 6.01 trillion from 3.11 trillion roubles * Series 24011 bonds close at 98.85 percent * Series 23003 bills close at 76.59 to yield 31.78 percent * Central bank raised 50.8 billion roubles by selling 23003 bills and 24011 bonds Dealers forecast the average yield of the new one-year bills, which mature on April 22, 1998, would be in a 31.34-33.37 percent range. The series 23003 one-year bills maturing April 8 next year closed with a yield of 31.78 percent. They forecast the average price of the new tranche of 24011 bonds, maturing March 31, 1999, in a 98.56-99.87 percent range. The earlier tranche closed at 98.85 percent. "I think there will be a strong element of non-resident demand at the auction, because the market already saw a rise in prices today," said Robert Devane, head of fixed income at Troika Dialog. "Strong demand will allow the Finance Ministry to carry out the auction in comfort and the one-year paper will probably be placed at a discount to market yields." Foreign investors typically favour longer-dated issues, because they allow them to secure current high yields, which are expected to trend lower. For the same reason, the series 24011 bonds are likely to attract foreign interest, as they are one of only two issues of OFZ interest-bearing bonds paying a semi-annual rather than quarterly coupon. Interest is set on a coupon when the previous coupon is paid and can fall sharply from one coupon to the next. Prices rose across the board on Tuesday. Shorter-dated issues rose as some operators took profits in long maturities and switched funds into shorter dates, dealers said. But other operators were buying longer-dated paper in the hope of strong price rises on Thursday from investors who fail to get all their bids at Wednesday's auctions. --Anna Smirnova, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
MCAT	Prices on the Caracas Stock Exchange ended mixed, broadly stable Thursday in weak trade as the market nervously eyed developments in an ongoing dispute between the government, unions and business over wage rises, brokers said. According to preliminary figures from the exchange, the market's 19-share index edged up 0.60 percent to 9,466.05, as 19 stocks rose, 12 fell and 14 closed flat. A 27 percent hike in gasoline prices midnight Wednesday did not provoke violent protests, allaying some fears, but the threat of a one-day national strike remained, brokers said.   Venezuela's largest union has threatened to stage a 12-hour strike August 6 to protest the fuel price hike and to pressure private sector companies to raise wages. "The market was fairly quiet, waiting to see what happens with the strike calls and salary rises," said Cavelba broker Rafael Alcantara. Although troubled by the disputes, the market is taking a measured rather than panicked viewpoint, brokers said. "If the strike is successful, foreign investors will pull out of the market because they are more easily scared by these things than locals," one said.   Volume was slim on Thursday with 1,009 trades worth a total of 4,573 billion bolivars ($9.2 million). Among leading stocks, benchmark Electricidad de Caracas fell 0.50 bolivar to 811 bolivars, telephone company CANTV rose 10 bolivars to 3,090 bolivars. Steelmaker Sivensa edged up 0.85 bolivar to 278 bolivars even though it reported lower third-quarter net profits of $15.9 million. Generally negative earnings reports were being shrugged off by the market on the expectation of improved results as the Venezuelan economy shows further recovery, brokers added.

ECAT	Ecuador's gross domestic product grew 0.9 percent in the second quarter, down from 4.7 percent growth in the same period of 1995, a top Central Bank source said Friday. The source, who requested anonymity, told Reuters that uncertainty generated by last July's presidential election caused the economy's expansion to slow down. "The economy stopped until the election results were known", he said.   Abdala Bucaram was elected president in runoff polls in July. GDP growth in the first quarter of 1996 was 1.9 percent. The government predicts the economy will grow 2.9 percent this year and 4.0 percent in 1997, up from 2.3 percent last year but down from 4.3 percent in 1994. Growth between April and June was led by the trade sector, wich rose 5.4 percent, and agriculture, up 2.5 percent. The financial services sector contracted 5.7 percent in the same period, while petroleum was off 4.4 percent, followed by a 2.2 percent fall in electricity and 0.5 percent drop in construction, the source said. -- Gustavo Oviedo, Quito Newsroom, 5932 258433
CCAT	Citicorp Chief Executive John Reed said Wednesday the giant banking company had held unfruitful deal talks with American Express Co. "We did hold talks but nothing came of them," Reed told shareholders at Citicorp's annual meeting. Rumours swirled several months ago that the two financial services groups were in preliminary transaction discussions but neither company had fully acknowledged the contacts. Answering shareholder questions, Reed said Citicorp has no intention of matching Monday's $1.7 billion acquisition of regional investment bank Alex. Brown Inc. by Bankers Trust New York Corp. The shareholder asked about the possibility of acquiring another regional brokerage, A.G Edwards & Sons. "We have no such plans. I suspect it was a good move for Bankers Trust, but we have no such plans," Reed said.

GCAT	Canadian actor Graham Greene, an Oscar nominee for his role in "Dances With Wolves", was in a hospital on Friday after a standoff with police in which he threatened to kill himself, authorities said. Police said no charges would be laid against Greene since no weapons were involved in the incident on Thursday, which ended peacefully after the actor agreed to a psychiatric assessment. "The police conversed with (Greene) over several hours at which time the matter was resolved without incident," York Regional Police Sgt. John Sheldon said in a phone interview. "(He) was taken to York County Hospital where he was admitted for psychiatric assessment." Sheldon said Greene had been "despondent over matters involving family and friends." Police surrounded Greene's house in Georgina, a town about 65 km (40 miles) north of Toronto, after reports that the actor had guns in the house and was suicidal. Greene was alone in the house during the standoff. His agent, Celia Chassels, declined to comment on the incident. The actor, best-known for portraying native North Americans in films, television and on stage, was nominated for a best supporting actor Academy Award for the 1990 film "Dances With Wolves," which won the Oscar for best picture.

ECAT	Canada's Finance Minister Paul Martin reaffirmed on Thursday that the budget deficit for 1995-96 will come in under C$30 billion.   "I've already stated they (the budget deficit figures) will come in slightly under C$30 (billion)," he said. Responding to a question about whether Quebec might not meet its budget deficit target, Martin declined to speculate. "I think it's very important, obviously, for Quebec, that they hit their deficit targets," Martin said.   The Canadian government previously targeted a deficit of C$32.7 billion for fiscal 1995/96 ended March 31. Martin has projected a 1996/97 budget deficit of C$24.3 billion and a 1997/98 budget deficit of C$17 billion. Martin made comments to reporter in Toronto following a speech to launch Canada Investment and Savings, which was previously known as the Canadian Retail Debt Agency. The agency was established last year to revitalize the sale of Canada Savings Bonds and other Government of Canada retail debt products. -- Jeffrey Hodgson (416) 941-8105, e-mail: jeffrey.hodgson@reuters.com
ECAT	The Bank of Namibia said on Wednesday efforts to build the country's manufacturing sectors needed to be encouraged to spur economic growth. "Economic growth patterns continue to be dictated by primary production and particularly weather conditions", the bank said in its 1996 annual report released on Wednesday. It quoted the country's drought and reduced fish stocks as the main reasons for the the country's poor economic performance last year. Namibia's real GDP expanded by only 2.6 percent in 1996, well below the five percent target set by the First National Development Plan (NDP1). In 1994 and 1995 the economy grew by 6.2 and 5.2 percent respectively. Slower economic growth in 1996 was due mainly to declines in secondary industries, particularly the manufacturing sector, which is dominated by fish and meat processing. Fish manufacturing output, which is directly dependent on quota allocations for pilchards, shrank by 43 percent last year with a halving of the Total Allowable Catch. Meat manufacturing output increased by 2.5 percent, supported by the increase in cattle sales due to the drought. The bank said government efforts to lessen dependency on agriculture and fishing, and to diversify the manufacturing sector should be encouraged. "The bank fully supports the EPZ (Economic Processing Zone) concept and has made several concessions with respect to exchange control regulations to facilitate the smooth implementation of this programme," the report said. In the absence of an offshore banking act the Bank of Namibia made provision for special banking facilities for EPZ enterprises to facilitate foreign currency disbursements and local investments. -- Windhoek Newsroom +2646 1 245-260
MCAT	Low sulphur straight run material was seen a touch weaker as crude slid lower on Wednesday. A couple of deals done earlier in the week at $135 cif NWE and $133 cif NWE were viewed as out of the ordinary - one forced deal was forced by problems at a UK refinery. Traders said the market eased back from these high levels and was closer to $123-124 fob NWE. "I would expect it to get nearer $120 fob," said one trader. A handful of European refiners have cut crude runs which could boost buying, but no extra demand was seen. High sulphur cargoes were assessed around formula +$5.
GCAT	A Croatian court on Friday acquitted a Bosnian Moslem charged with war crimes allegedly committed when he was an officer in former Yugoslavia's federal army (JNA), local media said. The county court in the Adriatic port of Zadar found Mirsad Catic, now a Bosnian embassy official in Bonn, not guilty of ordering a 1991 bombardment of the town during which more than 30 civilians were reported killed and 120 buildings damaged. Croatia also linked another 19 ex-JNA officers, including the current chief of staff of the Yugoslav army Momcilo Perisic, to the bombardment and on Thursday put them on trial in absentia for war crimes against Zadar civilians. JNA forces backed a Serb minority rebellion in 1991, helping them seize almost a third of Croatia by January 1992, when a ceasefire was signed. Croatian troops recaptured two of the three Serb-held enclaves in 1995 offensives. Catic, who was taken into Croatian custody in August, was the only one of the 20 defendants present in the court. In explaining the verdict, Judge Dubravko Krpina said the court could not find sufficient evidence that Catic had commanding authority at the time, HINA said. "Defence of the accused could not be refuted...and prosecution witnesses proved to be unreliable," Krpina said. He said they based their testimony on hearsay, which was unacceptable. Catic was subsequently released from the prison in Zadar. Croatian state radio said the trial of Perisic and his fellow officers would resume in November.

CCAT	Heavy engineering group Evans Deakin Ltd said on Monday that it anticipated another record result for the 1996/97 year and that its orders on hand and future prospects indicated a good longer term outlook.   Evans Deakin chairman Ron Paul said when releasing the group's half year results that orders on hand at December 31 totalled A$475 million. "Mr Paul added that the group was anticipating another record year and that the orders on hand and future prospects indicate a good longer term outlook," Evans Deakin said. Evans Deakin reported a net profit of A$9.09 million for the six months to December 31, up from A$6.05 million in the previous corresponding half. It set an unchanged dividend of seven cents.   Evans Deakin reported a net profit of A$14.11 million in the year to June 30, 1996. The first half net profit of A$9.09 million was a record. Earnings per share for the half fell however to 11.2 cents per share from 12 cents, "reflecting the significant increase in issued capital to fund the acquisition of Clyde Industries," Evans Deakin said. Sales jumped to A$409.44 million for the half from A$133.77 million a year earlier due to the acquisition of Clyde and strong revenue growth at its Walkers, Evans Deakin Engineering and Ralph M Lee units.   "The result was satisfactory considering the price pressures and subdued levels of demand in some of the markets we service and having regard to the task of integrating the Clyde businesses acquired," Paul said in a statement. Evans Deakin repeated that it expected to sell the balance of its chemicals businesses over the next six months, having sold its Wolseley Castle division in the last six months. Evans Deakins' share price was up five at A$3.39 at 2.15 p.m. (0315 GMT). -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800

ECAT	Countries must work for a balanced outcome on trade and investment issues before the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Ruben Ricupero, secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said on Monday. "In terms of Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) I would say the goal should be to have a balanced outcome," he told a business meeting. The first ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation is due to be held in Singapore in December. Industrialised countries want to broaden the WTO canvas to include items like MIA, labour standards and environment. The developing nations say they need time before they can join the other nations on fresh binding multilateral rules. Parminder Singh, chairman of Ranbaxy Laboratories, said the UNCTAD platform could be used to discuss emerging trade and investment issues. "We feel that the MAI cannot ask for commitments that will contravene or undermine promises made in the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) final act," Singh said. Ricupero said while WTO was a contractual agency, UNCTAD does not negotiate rules. "Our role is more of a prenegotiation phase and also practical application of the results of the negotiations." Ricupero said in recent years most of the flows of foreign direct investment were taking place among industrialised countries, with the least developed ones getting very little. He said with the liberalisation of the economy there was a close relationship between trade and foreign direct investment. Ricupero said in the next few years India would become one of the largest and fastest growing markets of the world.
CCAT	Poland's biggest Plock refinery on Friday raised the prices of its petrol and diesel fuel by five to eight percent at its filling stations and by 5.8 to 11.3 percent in wholesale, the refinery said in a statement.

GCAT	A hand grenade exploded outside a Budapest nightclub early on Wednesday in the latest in a series of bombings that police blame on a gangland turf war. The explosion shortly after 5 a.m. outside the Leroy Country Pub restaurant in the Hungarian capital blew out the windows of two parked cars but caused no casualties, police said. The bombing follows a spate of blasts outside nightclubs and restaurants and the murder earlier this month of a prominent Budapest gang leader. Jozsef Prisztas was shot at point-blank range with a 9mm handgun while sitting in his jeep. Police subsequently raided Budapest nightclubs, detaining scores of people. The Hungarian National Police have set up a 137-strong task force to deal with the gang war.
ECAT	Czech consumer inflation continued its gradual downtrend in January, but analysts said they do not expect a loosening of the central bank's tight monetary policy in the short-term. The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday said January inflation, month-on-month, was 1.2 percent, putting the year-on-year rate at 7.4 percent, down from 8.6 percent the previous month. The key sliding average inflation figure, which uses 1993 as a base, edged down to 8.7 percent from 8.8 percent in December, and was down from 9.1 percent in January 1996. "The January number is very good, about one percentage point lower than a year ago," Kamil Janacek, cheif economist at Komercni Banka told Reuters. "If prices and some deregulations develop accoridng to plan in the next months, and thanks to producer prices being under five percent...there is a high probability that 1997 inflation could end at around, or just under, eight percent," he added. The CSU said in a report that the biggest influences on the January inflation rate were food, drinks and tobacco products which rose 1.3 percent in the month, transportation which rose 3.6 percent and housing which rose by 1.3 percent. It added that of the 1.2 percent month-on-month rate, seasonal influences accounted for 0.23 percent, putting the seasonally-adjusted monthly rate at 0.97 percent. CSU figures show price deregulation influenced the seasonally-adjusted rate by 0.63 percent, while seasonally-adjusted core inflation was 0.34 percent. Despite the downtrend, most analysts agreed that there seems little chance the Czech National Bank (CNB), the central bank, will ease its tight monetary policy in the near future despite the sustained downtrend in CPI. Curbing inflation has been at the heart of almost all of the CNB's policies, and both CNB and government officials have said they expect rates to remain high, at least over the near term. "The month-on-month rate appears favourable," Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings, said. "While there may be some room for it, I doubt the central bank will lower rates immediately -- maybe in the second quarter at the earliest," he added. Last summer the CNB raised its key discount rate one percentage point to 10.5 percent, and hiked minimum reserve requirements to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent of deposits to squeeze off surging domestic demand. The moves have appeared to signficantly slow growth in the money supply, which is now at the lower end of the central bank's 13 to 17 percent growth target. But central bank officials have warned that wage growth -- which was up 21.2 percent in nominal terms in December according to preliminary figures -- and its influence on inflation is a growing concern. "The government has to somehow limit wage growth. It's just too high and this must be addressed before the central bank will move rates," said one London-based economist. Foreign exchange traders said the crown was unaffected by January's CPI figures since they were in line with forecasts. The crown was fixed by the central bank on Monday at 5.28 percent above its dollar/mark basket midpoint, slightly stronger than its +5.14 percent fixing from last Friday. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003
MCAT	Wall Street shares were mildly soft but steady at midday on Thursday, regrouping from volatile swings as money managers adjusted portfolios before the quarter end and next week's Federal Reserve meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about five points at 7685, after shifting between positive and negative territory for most of the day. Still, analysts said it was relatively calm compared to its recent choppiness. The Nasdaq composite was down about two points at 1444, as technology stocks stayed soft after profit warnings.   The long bond, which analysts said was partly guiding the stock market's movement, was moving toward session lows. It was down 9/32 at a 6.76 percent yield. "It's the end of the quarter, so there's a lot of adjusting portfolios, a lot of jiggling here," Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd said. "While we've had some movement today, compared to the recent volatility, it's no great shakes." Jim Benning, a trader at BT Brokerage, said: "The market's kind of flip-flopping around. Over the past couple of days, it's been very volatile. I think it's consolidating here."   The Dow industrials were moving in tandem with bonds, rising when U.S. Treasuries eased from lows and sliding as they dipped, analysts said. "This often happens when the stock market is running ahead of an earnings period," Doug Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan, said. Because many stocks were trading at such high valuations, based on prospects for long-term earnings, the stock market was particularly sensitive to the bond market, interest rates and inflation, Barbara Marcin, a vice president at Citibank Global Asset Management, said.   It was also jittery ahead of next week's Federal Reseve meeting, even though many analysts said they did not believe the Federal Reserve would act to raise interest rates. Other traders said the market was still nervous about comments by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at the start of the week, which caused fears Japan might sell its holdings of U.S. government bonds. But other market concerns faded to the background. Oil prices, whose rise had sparked inflation concerns Wednesday, backed off following a meeting by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).   OPEC pledged to freeze quotas, but oil traders said the deal would do little to stem downward pressure on oil prices. The August crude oil futures contract was down 40 cents at $19.12 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The Nasdaq composite suffered from several earnings warnings from the technology sector. Shares of Komag Inc, which makes thin-film media to store data on computer hard disk drives, were down 7-3/16 at 16-3/8. The company warned its results for the second quarter and the rest of its fiscal year would fall short of expectations because of weak demand for disk drives.   Shares of other disk drive makers were also down. Seagate Technology Inc, the world's largest disk drive maker, led the list of the most active stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, dropping 1-1/16 at 32-15/16. Komag said orders from Seagate would be cut in half to about 15 percent of sales compared with the first quarter. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc's stock soared 11 to 90-7/16 after news that Rhone-Poulenc SA planned a $4.3 billion bid for the stake in the U.S. drug company it did not already own.

GCAT	Astronomer and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Carl Sagan, who spent his life investigating the possiblity of life in outer space, died on Friday at age 62, a cancer centre spokeswoman said. Sagan died from pneumonia after a suffering from a bone marrow disease for two years, Susan Edmonds, spokeswoman for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre said. Sagan won the Pulitzer in 1978 for his book "Dragons of Eden" and was the author of several other best-selling books on space and the universe, including "Intelligent Life in the Universe," "Mars and the Mind of Man," and "Other Worlds." He was a professor at Cornell University, the Director of the Laboratory for Planetary Studies, and a pioneer in the field of exobiology, the branch of biology investigating the possibility of extraterrestial life. He appeared on several television shows, including the BBC production "The Violent Planet" and the PBS show "Cosmos," which he produduced beginning in 1977. He was diagnosed with the fatal bone marrow cancer in 1994 and had an up-and-down battle with the disease. He was noted educator who lectured astronauts, college students and Air Force Acedemy classes. He won dozens of awards for his ability to translate universal concepts into ordinary language.
CCAT	Four of Finnish pharmaceuticals group Orion-Yhtyma Oy's five divisions expect operating profits to improve this year, and the fifth division expects a flat profit, Orion said in its 1996 annual report on Wednesday. "The forecasts for Orion Pharma net sales and operating profit point to moderate growth," it said, referring to its biggest business group, which in 1996 accounted for 49 percent of consolidated net sales and 65 percent of operating profit. Oriola, which generated 32 percent of 1996 sales and 22 percent of the profit, was expected to perform on par with last year in 1997, Orion said. "The net sales growth of Oriola is expected to level off, and the operating profit is expected to remain at the previous year's level," it said. Referring to Noiro, which stood for 11 percent of 1996 sales and six percent of profit, Orion said: "Positive export expectations favour a relative strong growth in net sales. Operating profit growth is also expected." "Orion Diagnostica's net sales and operating profit are expected to grow," Orion said. Orion Diagnostica's slice of 1996 group sales was four percent and three percent of the consolidated operating profit. "Stronger demand is anticipated in Normet's business sectors, and Normet's net sales and operating profit (are) expected to grow," Orion said. Last year, Normet made up four percent of sales as well as of operating profit. Orion's consolidated net sales were 4.28 billion markka in 1996 compared to 4.06 billion the previous year, and its operating profit rose to 632 million markka from 596 million. The annual report repeated the company's earlier 1997 forecast that "Orion Group's net sales and operating profit may level off." -- Helsinki newsroom +358-9-680 50 245, news@reuters.fi

CCAT	Shares in major UK supermarket chains advanced on Thursday, while shares in Kwik Save Group Plc languished, amid perceptions that the big grocers were winning market share back from the discount high street shop, analysts and traders said. Safeway Plc shares -- which have lagged behind those of their main competitors -- -- led the advance, rising 11p, or 3.3 percent, by 1201 GMT to 344. Shares in J. Sainsbury Plc added 7-1/2p to 356-1/2, having matched its peak for the year at 359 earlier. The shares rallied on Wednesday, after the group posted strong-than-expected results. Shares in Tesco Plc firmed 2p to 376-1/2; it also met its year high at 379p earlier. Shares in Kwik Save, meanwhile, tumbled 17p, or 5.5 percent, to 291, after the group said its same store sales fell six percent during the first seven weeks of its second half. "Safeway, Tesco and Sainsbury appear to be gaining market share at (Kwik Save's) expense," an analyst said. "This is the first time we've seen that happen in two or three years." Shares in the major supermarket chains continued to draw strength from Sainsbury's results, they said. "People took heart from those figures," said one trader. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5106

Exports reached $400 million, up from the $387 million in August 1995. Imports fell to $252 million from $343 million. In the first eight months of 1996, Ecuador had a trade surplus of $839 million, up from $187 million a year earlier. -- Gustavo Oviedo, Quito Newsroom 5932 258433
ECAT	The Economic Times newspaper said on Thursday that the government estimates India's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by 6.7 percent in the 1996/97 fiscal year ending on March 31 over the preceding year.   The daily newspaper said the government's Economic Survey for 1996/97 was set to estimate GDP growth at 6.7 percent, "which is a considerable improvement on the earlier expectation that it was slowing down to about six percent". It said growth in the service sector would largely offset an anticipated slowdown in the manufacturing sector. The agriculture sector was expected to grow by about four percent in 1996/97 after declining in 1995/96, it said. Last week the government said GDP grew by 7.1 percent in 1995/96 and by 7.2 percent in 1994/95. -- New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024
ECAT	The Reserve Bank of Australia on Friday cut official interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 5.5 percent -- its fourth cut in less than a year. The bank has been under increasing political pressure to cut rates after the government released its 1997/98 budget 10 days ago, arguing economic growth and low inflation had set the scene for lower rates.   The central bank said it had decided to cut interest rates because it believed underlying inflation, now at 2.0 percent, would fall in the coming quarter. The bank also said forecast strong economic growth in 1997 and fiscal tightening in the government's budget also contributed to the cut. Rates were last cut in December last year when the official cash rate was brought down to 6.0 percent from 6.5 percent.   The central bank said it had decided to cut interest rates because it believed underlying inflation, now at 2.0 percent, would fall in the coming quarter. The bank said forecast strong economic growth in 1997 and fiscal tightening in the government's budget also contributed to the cut. Economic growth, currently 3.25 percent, is forecast to reach 3.75 percent in the 1997/98 fiscal year. "The above considerations -- namely, inflation forecast to fall below two percent, and economic activity providing scope for further expansion -- amount to a 'prima facie' case for an easing in policy," the bank said in a statement.   The Australian dollar slumped more than three quarters of a U.S. cent in hectic morning trade after the rate cut caught much of the market by surprise. By 9.40 a.m. (2340 GMT) the dollar had dived to US$0.7680/85, its lowest level since mid-February, from US$0.7761/66 just ahead of the bank's announcement. Shares rose strongly on the news, especially bank stocks. The All Ordinaries stock market index hit a record 2,565.5 points, up 17.6 points. "I am surprised that they have done this," said Chris Richardson, director of Access Economics.   "I would have expected no change until early 1998 when I would have expected rates to go up on the basis of very rapid growth in the United States, translating into rapid growth here and adding to inflation," he said. Rates were last cut in December last year when the official cash rate was brought down to 6.0 percent from 6.5 percent.
CCAT	China is cleaning up its market for mutual funds to prepare them to become a key vehicle to channel huge bank deposits back into the economy and stabilise its volatile stock markets, analysts said on Monday. Among the most important steps, Beijing last week lifted a three-year ban on new listings of stock investment funds and has said it will shortly promulgate a set of rules governing the management of such funds. Three funds listed last week surged as investors sought to buy into what analysts see becoming a major focus for the market in the months ahead. The first effort to establish investment funds in the early 1990s collapsed in disarray because of a lack of adequate regulations and supervision with many losing money. A total of 75 funds were set up, but only a few received approval from the central bank, and only 22 have been listed on China's two stock exchanges. Investors in unlisted funds will be unable to recover their cash for years to come. "The central government first of all wants to clean up the fund market," said Shao Jiejun, a manager at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities which manages Baoding Fund, one of China's existing stock investment funds. "The fund money is expected to gradually flow into stocks, which should benefit the market greatly," he added. At the moment, less than 10 percent of the money in existing funds is invested in stocks, Zhou Daojiong, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told a recent seminar in Beijing. "Quality of fund managers is poor," Zhou was quoted by the China Securities as saying. "There have been many cases of irregularities and some funds have been used to participate in market manipulation and insider trading." Most of the money was invested by the fund managers in industry and real estate projects two or three years ago when the stock markets were in a deep slide. "Time is needed for old funds to withdraw from industrial and real estate projects and to establish new funds," said Xu Zhiling, deputy general manager of the securities trading department of China Guotai Securities. Beijing has given strong indications that it supports the establishment of new investment funds and sees them as a major means of funnelling money from bank deposits, currently at record levels of more than three trillion yuan ($361.4 billion), back into the economy. Experts say the authorities want to gradually replace the system of bank loans which currently support enterprises with a share system in which firms obtain money through investment rather than borrowing. China's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen also suffer from huge volatility because of an absence of large funds and institutional money providing a non-speculative base to trading, they said. Currently, stock funds account for less than one percent of China's stock investment with the share market being dominated by retail investors, searching for quick profits instead of long-term investment, Shanghai brokers said. In new rules to be issued shortly, there will be provisions that require stock funds to invest at least 60 percent of their cash in securities, industry sources said. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)
CCAT	-- Soundview Financial analyst Mark Specker raised his short-term rating on Compaq Computer Corp to buy from hold Wednesday. -- Less than two weeks ago, the analyst had reinitiated Compaq with a short-term hold rating and a long-term buy. -- In a phone interview, Specker said he upgraded his short-term opinion based on price. "The stock pulled back to a valuation that we thought was atttactive," he said.   -- The analyst said he believed sales of Compaq's corporate PCs remain brisk, with Pentium Pro models in especially short supply, leading him to project increasing gross margins for the company's fourth quarter. -- He estimated overall gross profit margins of 23.8 percent compared to his previous model of 23.4 percent. -- The analyst attributed this to what he called a "very benign pricing environment" for Compaq that has protected it from some of the constant industry pressures to cut prices in order to spur demand. -- The analyst also bumped up his 1996 earnings estimate by a penny to $4.67. He left his 1997 year estimate unchanged at $5.69. -- Traders said Specker's comments helped spur Compaq stock to close up 6-1/4 on volume of 5.5 million shares. -- He described consumer sales as a "sort of" inventory clearance of product ahead of the introduction of new PCs running more powerful Intel processors in January. "We are seeing good Christmas sales but not a house on fire," he said. -- "These are eggs the hen layed earlier in the year. You've got to turn them into omelettes or you lose them."
GCAT	Unseeded American Linda Wild smudged up the golden reputation of her country's Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport with a smashing 6-2 3-6 6-0 fourth-round upset at the U.S. Open Sunday. Wild didn't hold back on any shots, blistering the National Tennis Centre stadium court with 24 winners in sending the eighth-seeded Davenport crashing to her first loss of the summer. "I knew going into the match I had to go for the first strike, go after her," said Wild after reaching the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam for the first time in the 25-year-old's career. "If I got into a rally, and I didn't get her moving before she got me moving, then I was dead. "I thought the key was that I was playing more of a first-strike match than her," said Wild, ranked 32nd in the world. After losing in the second round of Wimbledon to Larisa Neiland, the 20-year-old Davenport had put together a 16-match winning streak, punctuated by a win over Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the Atlanta Games final and a victory the following week over Steffi Graf in the Los Angeles semifinals. "This is definitely a huge disappointment after I had a great two months," said Davenport, who had lost just 10 games in her first three Open wins. "I was looking forward to doing well here. It's going to be hard because this was pretty much the biggest tournament of the year for myself." Except for Davenport's nighttime exit, things went as expected for the seeded women in action as number two Monica Seles and number four Conchita Martinez cruised into the final eight. Seles flirted briefly with trouble, trailing 3-5 in the first set, before winning the last nine games to beat Frenchwoman Sandrine Testud 7-5 6-0. "I just told myself, just go for your shots, even if you lose the set, no big deal, there's still another set to go," said Seles. Martinez never was troubled by Swede Asa Carlsson in the Spaniard's 6-2 6-1 win. Davenport was in trouble right away. The match was not even 10 minutes old when she was already down 3-0. It was 5-0 after just 16 minutes. "She started off playing unbelievable tennis, some of the best tennis I've played against in a very long time," said Davenport. "She came in fighting hard and ready to take it, as she did." Said Davenport: "Once I got down in the beginning, I lost my confidence a lot." Davenport regrouped in the second set to find her golden touch long enough to sweep three games in a row for a 5-2 lead and then held serve at love at 5-3 to even the match. But the comeback stopped there. Davenport made 13 unforced errors and won just 10 points in the final set. Davenport had been lighter and faster around the court this summer after sheding 20 pounds (nine kg) off her 6 foot, 2 inch (1.89 metres) frame. But she could only lumber around the court in futile pursuit of Wild's winners. "I felt a little out of it," said Davenport. "I don't know what it was. I was just flat."
MCAT	LIFFE cocoa futures ended Tuesday at one-year highs on aggressive fund and spec buying on the back of a bullish chart picture. Benchmark September gained 11 stg to end at 1,141 stg a tonne, the best finish since June 1996. But prices were off intraday the high of 1,162 on late profit-taking. New York's inability to extend its steep gains on Monday also contributed to some liquidation in London. But the overall technical outlook remains buoyant. Traders said while there could be some correction to an overbought condition, the mood remained upbeat. "It's a very good move on the upside and the charts remained constructive," said one trader. Another said: "It is being stoked up by spec buying. Fundamentally, there's no particular reason to be bullish, nothing has changed." In one latest fundamental development, weather analysts said heavy mid-June rains in Ivory Coast raised wet season rainfall totals to at least average levels and boosted prospects for the 1997/98 (Oct-April) main cocoa crop. Fund buying chased New York cocoa futures to new eight-year peaks on Monday amid bullish technical indicators. Volume was brisk with a hefty 17,153 lots changing hands, led by forward September and December. By the close, December stood 20 higher at 1,150 to command a three stg premium to September. Cocoa has risen by 15 percent since early June on the back of bullish chart picture and concerns over longer-term weather-related supply situation. There had been worries that the developing El Nino weather pattern and the current crop development in West Africa could affect the coming 1997/98 crop. Some traders said it was still too early to say that there would be a crop shortage next season. This week's rally was fuelled by a smaller-than-expected rise in net speculative long positions as of June 17 in New York. The U.S. CFTC Commitment of Traders report, released late on Friday, showed speculators were net long some 25,000 lots, which was below most traders' expectations of a 30,000-lot speculative net long position. "In August 1994, the net longs were 41,000 tonnes. Based on the current 25,000 lots, there's an awful lot of buying to be done," said one. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985

CCAT	Blue-chip Shanghai Diesel Engine Co Ltd reported a 4.86 percent fall in 1996 net profits on Friday and analysts blamed tight national credit policies which have hit most of its clients. The company's 1996 net profit was 143.821 million yuan against 151.164 million yuan in 1995, based on domestic accounting standards, a company statement in Friday's Shanghai Securities News said. According to international accounting standards, its 1996 net profit was 126.688 million yuan, the statement said but did not give comparative figures. The company statement said government policy was the key factor for the decline in profit, a reference to the tight credit policies in force since 1993. "Price rises for water and electricity also dragged down our profits," it said. An analysis report from Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co Ltd said the company had to take care to control soaring accounts receivables, resulting from cash shortages among many of Diesel's customers.   The company statement said Shanghai Diesel's joint venture with Caterpillar Inc, which started operations in early 1995, remained in loss last year, which also pulled down Diesel's profits, the company statement said. The joint venture, in which Shanghai Diesel has a 45 percent stake, reported a loss of 40.283 million yuan in 1996, it said. The two sides are discussing how to solve the venture's problems, Diesel officials have said. Despite the company's decline in 1996 profit, major brokerages in Shanghai still recommend its B shares as a "buy" due to its long-term good outlook. "Looser credit control in 1997 should be in favour of Diesel," said a report from ING Barings. With 70 percent of its output used in construction machinery and heavy duty engines, the company will benefit from the expected 13 percent year-on-year growth of the transportation and infrastructure sectors through to 2000, it said. China's biggest brokerage, Shenyin & Wanguo, also recommended Shanghai Diesel as a "buy". Trading of Shanghai Diesel was suspended on Friday morning and will resume in the afternoon on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
MCAT	U.S. spot fuel oil prices were unchanged to steady again Tuesday in quiet trade, with low sulphurs still pressured by oversupply despite forecasts for more below-normal East Coast weather later this week. "There's so much oil around. The burns are up, but everyone's sitting on pretty good inventories," said one cash trader, noting low sulphurs seemed weaker than high sulphur grades. In New York Harbor, physical one percent slipped by about 25 cents to $18.50 a barrel, with February paper talked down more than a quarter to the $18.00 area, traders said.   NYH 0.3 percent high pour, still well-offered, slipped another 50 cents to below the $20 level despite reports of another NYPA tender for 100,000 barrels for Jan 21-31 delivery. Fixed-price bids only are due Wednesday at 1100 EST. High sulphurs in New York again held steady, with 2.2 percent still quoted in the low-$17s. At the U.S. Gulf, prices were stable, with one percent at $17.75-18.00 though some still thought the number was closer to $17.50. USG three percent was unchanged at $15.75-16.00, traders said.

GCAT	The discovery of a putrefied body locked in a trunk in the cellar of a derelict Brussels garage has reopened a grim Belgian dossier of child abuse and murder. Belgian media speculated that the body found on Wednesday was that of Moroccan-born Loubna Benaissa, a nine-year-old girl who went missing in 1992. The mayor of the capital's Ixelles district, Yves de Jonghe d'Ardoye, told reporters early on Thursday that a suspect taken to the site had admitted murder, but gave few other details. Police said the result of an autopsy would only be known later on Thursday. Investigators with sniffer dogs and high-tech equipment had searched for hours on Wednesday in the section of Ixelles where she vanished while running an errand to a local supermarket. The area is popular with north African immigrants and dozens of Arabic-speaking residents gathered at the scene on Wednesday awaiting news of the investigation. De Jonghe d'Ardoye told reporters: "The body of a child has been found...in a trunk in a cellar." "We can't possibly say who it is because the autopsy has not taken place yet. The body is totally decomposed, we can't tell you what age it is." "It has been there for three, four, five years...it is not a recent death," he added. The investigation into Benaissa's disappearance was marked by allegations of bungling by authorities who were accused of not taking the case seriously, failing to appoint an investigating judge and for closing the file on the case after just two years. It was reopened in August last year after the discovery of bodies of four girls murdered by a gang allegedly led by child rapist Marc Dutroux. Dutroux was arrested following the rescue from a makeshift dungeon in his house of Sabine Dardenne and Laetitia Delhez -- both of whom had been sexually abused. Two days later Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight-year-old Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo, buried in the garden of one of his six houses in and around the central Belgian city of Charleroi. The girls had starved to death. Barely two weeks later Dutroux again led police to another house where they unearthed the bodies of teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks. The parents of the dead girls launched a campaign complaining at police and judicial bungling in the searches for their daughters. They were joined by the parents of other missing children including Elizabeth Brichet and Loubna. In October more than 250,000 people took to the streets of Brussels in what came to be known as the White March -- the biggest peacetime demonstration of its kind in the country. Early on Thursday, activists from the populist group gathered in Ixelles to hand out leaflets and pictures of children still unaccounted for. -- Brussels newsroom ++ 32 2 287 6832
GCAT	Inter Milan, declaring Ajax to be "seriously at fault", said on Thursday they would ask a FIFA legal commission to resolve a row with the Dutch club over Nigerian international Nwankwo Kanu. The 20-year-old star of the Nigerian team that won the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta was signed by Inter in the close season for a fee of around $2 million but was then diagnosed with a life-threatening heart defect. Kanu has not played a single league match for the Italian club after Inter's doctors discovered the problem. FIFA's medical commission said in a statement on Wednesday that they had found no irregularities in the transfer and maintained that Inter were responsible for establishing a player's health before they completed the contract. Inter, who have tried to get the transfer and the Nigerian striker's contract made void because of his condition, disagreed in a strongly-worded statement. They said media reports that FIFA had ruled against them were incorrect because a formal complaint had yet to be presented to FIFA's legal commission. "Inter is convinced that Ajax is seriously at fault, towards both us and the player who as an extremely young man was entrusted to the professionalism and seriousness of the Dutch club," the statement said. "However, after trying in vain to come to a fair solution with Ajax, and considering the Dutch club's totally closed attitude, Inter now intends to go to FIFA's legal affairs commission," the statement added. Inter said it had not previously gone to the commission because it believed the priority was to help Kanu and to set up a programme of visits with leading specialists. Kanu, who has said he is "emotionally shattered" by what could be the end of his career, is reportedly to undergo surgery in the United States next week.
MCAT	The London Metal Exchange (LME) April options declaration went smoothly on Wednesday, as copper and aluminium futures hovered at strikes with modest open interest while lead saw a lump of calls declared. The underlying April contracts in copper and aluminium gravitated towards $2,400 and $1,600 per tonne respectively on Tuesday evening and barely strayed from there by the time options were declared around noon. April copper settled at $2,398 and the options market saw a partial declaration, with about 80 percent of calls and 60 percent of puts declared, traders said. "I think people declared just enough to make them square," one said. But open interest at $2,400 was not very substantial, with 985 lots (equivalent to 24,625 tonnes) of calls and 680 lots (17,000 tonnes) of puts, LME data showed. Implied volatilities were a touch weaker since last week with nearbys bid around 18.00 percent. One dealer said there had been some enquiries on Wednesday morning for upside options in May and further out, but no business had been done. People were interested in selling at-the-money options for the third and fourth quarters, he added. "It's very quiet. There are a few sellers around and we're struggling to find buyers," another trader said. April aluminium futures settled just above $1,600 and options also saw a partial declaration with more calls than puts declared, traders said. Open interest at $1,600 was 1,009 lots (25,225 tonnes) of calls and 616 lots (15,400 tonnes) of puts. Volatilities, like copper, were also slightly soggy, with nearbys bid around 15 percent. April lead edged above the $700 level, settling at around $710 when options were declared. The $700 calls were declared, in which the open interest was fairly large, considering the thinner market, at 490 lots (12,250 tonnes). "I think lead had a bit of a run-up with those $700 positions open," a trader said. Zinc settled just under the $1,300 level and the puts were thought to be declared. Open interest at $1,300 was only 30 lots in calls (750 tonnes) and 75 lots (1,875 tonnes) in puts. But at the same strike level, a large amount of open interest lurks in May calls, 1,458 lots (36,450 tonnes). Scant open interest was seen in nickel and tin. --Eric Onstad, London Newsroom +44 171 542-8065
GCAT	Algeria's radical Armed Islamic Group (GIA), locked in a five-year-old conflict with the Algerian government, said foreign governments offered to supply it with money and weapons, an Arab paper said on Sunday. GIA chief Antar al Zouabri was quoted by the London-based Arabic language Al-Hayat newspaper as saying the GIA had broken its links with radical fundamentalist groups in Egypt and Libya because of ideological divergencies. He termed Libyan militants as being only "fundamentalists on paper". "You have to know that the Armed Islamic Group has been offered material support, and not only moral support, from some regimes, which offered to supply it with weapons, ammunition, equipment and money," said al Zouabri quoted by Al-Hayat. He did not identify these governments but said his group had rebuffed the offers. The GIA, a ruthless Moslem fundamentalist organisation fighting to establish a purist fundamentalist state in the North African country, is blamed for killing civilians, including female activists, writers, journalists and religious workers. It is also blamed for taking Algerian civil strife into French streets where eight people were killed and around 170 injured by bombs between July and October last year in Paris and the central city of Lyon. The GIA's al Zouabri, dismissing the tide of outrage in Algeria following the killing of non-combatant civilians, said "there are many religious proofs which make legitimate (our) bombing operations even when there are civilian victims." He made clear there had been cooperation between Egypt's Jihad (Holy War) and Libya's Combatant Armed Group and the GIA but it ended because of ideological in-fighting. "It became clear after discussions with the Combatant Group that they are only fundamentalists on paper and all just talk... They are much close to the Moslem Brotherhood path," he said. Moslem Brotherhood followers are seen as moderate activists seeking change through elections. The statement carried by al Hayat was believed to be the first reported remarks ascribed to al Zouabri since he replaced Djamel Zitouni, who was killed last July near Larba, 25 km (15 miles) south of Algiers. More than 50,000 people have died in Algeria's violence since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a huge lead.
GCAT	Chad Carvin, a virtual lock for the 1996 Olympic Games before suffering a career-threatening illness, showed he is back in winning form Tuesday at the U.S. national swimming championships. Carvin, 23, ranked second in the world in the 200- and 400-meter freestyle events before the Olympic trials, came from behind to win the 400 freestyle in three minutes, 50.13 seconds. It was Carvin's third national title against a field that included Olympic 400-meter individual medley gold medalist Tom Dolan. "I always knew I would be back, I just wasn't sure when," Carvin said. "I am swimming good times so I don't think there's any question about my illness anymore." Carvin was stricken with cardiomyopathy, a virus that attacks the heart muscle, in December 1995, just three months before the Olympic trials. He was confined to bed rest for 90 days. "At the beginning it was a career-ending disease," said 1996 Olympic men's coach Jon Urbanchek, who gave Carvin his award. "He walked back literally from the grave. Everyone in this pool is proud of him. Chad is back." Dolan, experiencing breathing problems since he arrived because of heat and pool chemicals, experienced stomach problems before the race, and had a slight asthma attack as a result during the race. He finished eighth in 4:01.76. The only other individual men's winner was Lenny Krayzelburg, 21, in the 100-meter backstroke in 55.05. Misty Hyman, 18, posted the fastest 100-meter butterfly time (58.72) by an American in 64 months in the morning preliminary with her innovative fish kick and underwater start. She won the event in 59.49. Hyman is only the eighth swimmer to break 59 and four of the swimmers are from China. Schoolgirl Jenna Street, 15, won the 200-meter breaststroke in 2 minutes, 28.97 seconds to win her first national title in only her second senior nationals. Street swam against a field that included Olympians Kristine Quance, Jilen Siroky and Amanda Beard, a double silver medalist at the 1996 Olympics in breaststroke. "I told myself she's a girl just like I am, the same age," Street said about swimming against Beard, "just treat her the same way I would anyone else."
CCAT	Forth Ports Plc chairman Hugh Thomson said on Friday that the group's trading in the first four months was encouraging. Thomson told the company's annual general meeting: "Group trading in the first four months of 1997 continues to be encouraging with tonnages up on the same period last year." He said a recently announced contract with Swedish paper producer MoDo AB would lead to 180,000 tonnes of additional business at Tilbury over a full year. Thomson also said Grangemouth had won an additional 70,000 tonnes of steel traffic. Scottish group Forth Ports acquired Tilbury in 1995. He added that the group was still confident of concluding an agreement for a new riverside facility at Tilbury which could be operational by the last quarter of 1997. In March Forth Ports said it was planning a new intermodal facility at the London terminal. -Paul Berrill Reuters Shipping News + 44 171 542 4087

GCAT	A United Nations human rights official in Colombia called on the government on Thursday to disband armed civilian groups set up to track leftist rebels. "We have reliable evidence that many of these groups are involving the civilian population directly in the conflict and increasing the level of violence," said Almudena Mazarrasa, U.N. High Commission for Human Rights director for Colombia. She said her office had received information that the legal intelligence-gathering groups, known as Rural Security Cooperatives or Convivirs, had overstepped their powers. Critics say the Convivirs have become vigilante groups, arming themselves with automatic weapons, launching their own fight against the guerrillas and committing human rights abuses on those they suspect of backing the rebels. Colombian and international human rights groups have also accused Convivirs of having close ties to illegal right-wing death squads. The Convivirs were set up early in President Ernesto Samper's administration and assigned the task of working with the military authorities and alerting them of guerrilla movements. Convivir members carry sophisticated communications equipment but are legally only allowed to carry handguns for self-defence, not offensive actions. There are more than 700 Convivirs operating in the country today, and by some estimates there will be more than 1,200 by the end of the year.
MCAT	Taiwan's share prices were losing steam in late trade on Tuesday as investors locked in profits after the index's dramatic burst above 10,000, brokers said. The benchmark stock index surged as high as 10,057 but by 0315 GMT, with 45 minutes of trading to go, had slipped 8.82 points or 0.09 percent to stand at 9,914.23. Turnover was relatively heavy at T$163 billion. "The pressure was strong and investors were cautious" above 10,000, said Lin Long-hsien, assistant manager of United Securities.   Brokers said profit-taking pressure was strong, particularly in the electronics sector. Electronics were down 0.74 percent, hit by an announcement by Dutch firm Philips Electronic NV that it was selling 100 million shares of chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

March IPE gas oil was down $2.75 a tonne at $170.75 after hitting a seven-month, spot contract low of $169.75. Mild weather in much of Europe tempered demand in a market that was slowly recovering from industry functions that took place in London this week. Heating oil barge premiums held around $1.75-2.00 a tonne for second half February material with first half March around 50 cents lower. FOD cargoes looked unchanged around March IPE +$2-4 cif NWE for second half Feb with DIN around March IPE +$6. Russian product look steady around March IPE +$1-2 cif NWE.

ECAT	The Bank of Israel's quarterly company survey published on Tuesday said economic activity in the third quarter of the year stabilised at the levels of the two preceding quarters. The survey said activity in the industrial, trade, transport and communications sectors was stable in the third quarter while activity in the building and hotel industries dropped. No figures were published. The industrial companies surveyed said their sales to the local market were frozen, while exports had risen at the same rate as the previous two quarters. They also said they had registered a drop in the number of employees. The hotel industry said there was a significant contraction in the levels of activity mainly because of the security situation.
ECAT	China's Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli said on Monday the state would have to tighten its belt for a long time to curb rapidly rising expenditure. Growth in state revenue had averaged more than 90 billion yuan ($10.8 billion) a year from 1993 to 1996, but that was not enough to cover rising expenditure, state radio quoted Liu as saying. "We must tighten our belts, and moreover, we must tighten our belts for a very long time," Liu said. In 1997, Beijing should set up an apparatus for budgetary control and rein in the rapid growth of spending, Liu said. China should "bring the fine traditions of practising economy and opposing waste into financial management," Liu said. Liu did not elaborate on what this would entail but said China should ensure fiscal support for agriculture, education, science and technology and government organs. Earlier this month Liu said China had reported a basically balanced budget for 1996, with the state deficit held within the targeted range. State revenue increased by 18.1 percent in the first 11 months, official reports have said. The finance ministry has forecast a budget deficit of 60 billion yuan in 1997, with financial revenue seen increasing by 13-15 percent. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)

ECAT	Underlying UK inflation edged upwards in September, creating another headache for Britain's ruling Conservative Party and its hopes for substantial, vote-winning tax cuts, analysts said. "This figure will be a double blow to Clarke," said Alex Garrard, UK economist at UBS. "Not only does it take the gloss off his speech, but the September inflation figures are used to uprate social security benefits." The rise in underlying inflation to 2.9 percent year-on-year will therefore add to the government's spending bill.   Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke will deliver a keynote speech to the Conservative Party's annual conference in Bournemouth later on Thursday. With elections due by May 1997 and the Conservatives trailing badly in the polls, many in the party are baying for substantial tax cuts from Clarke in his November budget. Garrard said the pick-up in September inflation, and the consequent rise in social security and pensions payments, could add as much as 500 million stg to government spending. "It's a further headache for Clarke's budget sums and cramps his scope for tax cuts," he said.   But September's inflation figures may not herald a long-term rise in price pressures yet. The headline figure held steady at 2.1 percent year-on-year and much of the upward pressure came from rising petrol and clothing and footwear prices. Rising petrol prices, reflected in a 1.5 percent monthly increase in motoring costs, have been fuelled by higher crude oil prices and petrol retailers rebuilding margins. But Garrard said price competition would resume soon. "Near-term, that upward pressure will continue but once the oil price drops back a bit the price war at the petrol pumps will resume."   The largest price increases came from clothing and footwear. They leapt by 5.2 percent in September, the highest monthly rise on record, according to the Office For National Statistics. "We know that retailing is doing quite well and they've obviously used the opportunity to push through higher prices on the autumn lines at the end of the summer sales," said Marian Bell, economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. But Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets, said it was too early to say high street spending sprees will fuel retail price inflation.   "Consumers are still looking for value for money in the high street and the steep drop in factory gate inflation should soon start to feed through into core retail price inflation." Producer output prices rose just 2.0 percent year-on-year in August, their lowest since mid-1994. Garrard agreed. "From an initial reaction of 'Oh dear', I'm inclined to treat this figure as more of a blip." But whether inflation is on an upward path or not, Thursday's figures certainly do not weaken the Bank of England's hand as it calls for an early tightening of monetary policy, taking base rates to 6.00 percent from 5.75.   But few analysts expect Clarke to budge ahead of the elections, particularly if he can produce only modest tax cuts in November. "The figures are not bad enough to worry the Chancellor but will reinforce the Bank's campaign for policy tightening," said Andrew Milligan, economist at General Accident. A still-struggling manufacturing economy and a resilient currency give Clarke enough ammunition to keep the Bank at bay. "It will reawaken speculation about a pre-emptive rate rise, but Clarke can highlight still-weak manufacturing and the strength of the pound to leave rates on hold," Garrard said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109
ECAT	California state Treasurer Matt Fong on Tuesday named 71 firms to six new underwriting pools that will handle state and agency bond issues over the next two years. Firms placed in the underwriting pools will be eligible to serve as book-running manager or co-manager on bond financings, Fong said. The new pools take effect on April 1, he added. The pools will handle state, public works board, joint powers authority and other state agency issues.

"We had initially expected the market to remain slow, but a spurt of fresh big-cap buying in late trading boosted sentiment and prompted further buying in small-caps," one broker said.   Heavyweight Barito Pacific topped the active list as it rose 75 rupiah to close at 1,550 rupiah, with some 6.8 million shares changing hands. Brokers attributed the rise to news reports on Thursday that Indonesia's export earnings from the forestry sector rose to $8.3 billion in 1996 from $7.1 billion in 1995. Another heavyweight, Telkom, ended 125 rupiah higher at 4,225 rupiah in active trading following the government's decision to revise local telephone tariffs.   The government announced on Monday it planned to raise tariffs for local telephone calls and lower the cost of regional and international calls from January 1. Secondliners property firm Summarecon and travel firm Bayu Buana were among the most actively traded due to speculative reasons, brokers said. Summarecon rose 75 rupiah to 975 rupiah on continued talk of a possible acquisition and that it may soon touch 1,000 rupiah. Bayu Buana rose 100 rupiah to 825 rupiah on market talk that the travel firm may touch 900 rupiah in the coming days as it was still considered undervalued, another broker said.

ECAT	By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent Federal Reserve policy-makers are expected to decide this week to hold interest rates steady amid signs that the economy has cooled off as the weather has heated up, economists and analysts said. "Fireworks at the Fed appear remote," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Philadelphia-based First Union Corp. Inflation is low and stable. Economic growth is slowing from the first quarter's rambunctious rate, and Wall Street is not calling for another central bank rate increase. A survey of 18 top economists by St. Louis-based Macroeconomic Advisers found that all but three expect the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee to leave rates unchanged at its meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. In an effort to prevent the economy from overheating and to extend the expansion, the central bank tightened credit in March for the first time in more than two years, bumping up a key short-term rate by a quarter percentage point, to 5.5 percent. Since then, the economy has slowed sharply, to an annualized pace of between 1.5 percent and 2.0 percent in the second quarter, from a sizzling 5.9 percent rate in the first, the fastest clip in more than nine years. "The slowdown has come quicker and more abruptly than many people had expected," said Joel Prakken, Chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers. "It has kind of frozen everybody." Politics also would seem to argue against a rate rise now, analysts said. Central bank Chairman Alan Greenspan is slated to present the Fed's semi-annual assessment of the economy to Congress on July 22 and he would find it hard to defend a rate hike to lawmakers when growth is slowing and inflation low. "I wouldn't want to be Alan Greenspan up in front of Congress explaining why he's just tightened," said David Wyss, senior economist at Massachusetts-based consultants DRI/McGraw Hill. "And I think he feels the same away." The Fed's March 25 rate rise drew what Greenspan himself has acknowledged was more than the normal amount of criticism. Some analysts believe those attacks may have helped convince the Fed to hold rates steady at its last meeting, on May 20. Fed officials admitted that it would not be easy to justify another rate increase now, but they said that would not stop the central bank from acting if it saw a need to do so. Some economists, including those at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, believe that it is only a matter of time before the Fed tightens credit further. "They need an excuse to tighten," was how James Griffin, investment strategist at Connecticutt-based Aeltus Investment Management, put it. They could find it before too long. The economy's second-quarter lull is widely expected to prove temporary. With unemployment at a 23-year low, consumer confidence at a 27-year high and the stock market at record levels, all the ingredients for a rebound are in place. "The underlying fundamentals are good," Macroeconomic Advisers' Prakken said. "It's sensible to expect a rebound in the third quarter. The question is how strong of one." With the economy already running at or above capacity, it would not take much of a rebound to raise the risk of faster inflation, analysts said. The unemployment rate is already at levels that in the past led to stepped-up wage demands and eventually higher inflation. At their two-day meeting this week, Fed policy-makers are also expected to update their economic forecast for this year and discuss projections for next year. In February, they forecast growth this year of between 2 percent and 2.25 percent and consumer price inflation of between 2.75 percent and 3 percent. Analysts expect the former to be revised upward to take account of the strong growth of the first quarter. The latter is likely to be little changed.
CCAT	Swedish tool and speciality metals maker Sandvik on Tuesday said it stood by an earlier forecast of lower profits in 1996 but saw continued good profitability. Posting an 18 percent fall in nine month profit after financial items, Sandvik said adverse currency effects were expected to wipe 200 million crowns ($30.4 million) off fourth quarter profits. ($ = 6.587 Swedish Crowns)   "The forecast for 1996 remains valid: continued high profitability, but lower earnings than in 1995," Sandvik said in its report for the nine months ending September 30, 1996. Sandvik said its profit after financial items fell to 3.54 billion crowns in the period and order intake fell to 20.52 billion crowns from 23.08 billion. It said the primary reason for the decline in earnings for the period was the Swedish crown, whose strengthening at the end of 1995 hit Sandvik's earnings in mid-1996. "The main reason for the decline in earnings was the appreciation of the Swedish crown at the end of 1995, which gained its full impact on Sandvik's earnings as of the middle of 1996," the company said. "The net impact was about a 400 million crown charge during the first nine months of the year. "The net impact for the full year 1996 is estimated at about a 600 million crown charge."
GCAT	Former New Mexico Representative Bill Richardson was sworn in as new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations on Thursday and said he wanted to be a bridge to developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. After taking the oath of office from Vice President Al Gore at a White House ceremony, Richardson also pledged to work to see that the United States pays more than $1 billion in outstanding dues to the world organisation. "The U.N. is important to the United States. I'm a firm believer in the U.N. We must pay our dues there. That is my mandate, that is my mission," he said. Richardson, a Hispanic-American who served as a part-time diplomatic troubleshooter for President Bill Clinton before being named to his new post, said he wanted to be "a bridge to the developing world of Asia, Africa and Latin America." He was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday to replace Madeleine Albright. She became secretary of state last month. Richardson, 49, resigned from Congress shortly before his swearing-in ceremony, leaving the House of Representatives with 227 Republicans, 205 Democrats, one independent and two vacancies. He represented New Mexico's third congressional district, which includes Santa Fe, since 1983. A special election will be scheduled to fill the rest of his two-year term through 1998. Richardson thanked his former constituents as he assumed his new duties and said he hoped "someday, I might represent them again." He said he and his wife, Barbara, planned to leave for New York over the weekend, and that he would be on the job as U.N. envoy on Monday.
CCAT	Reaching into his past to help guide Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. through a crisis, new chairman and chief executive Dr. Thomas Frist on Monday named Jack Bovender president and chief operating officer of the embattled hospital firm. Bovender was Frist's head of operations at Hospital Corp. of America, or HCA, which Frist co-founded with his father in 1968 and then sold to Columbia three years ago. Bovender, 51, will assume his new job immediately, Frist said. "Jack's three decades of work in the industry, along with his commitment to the value-based corporate culture we intend to institutionalize throughout Columbia/HCA, make him the right choice," Frist said in a statement. Nashville, Tenn.-based Columbia is reeling from a massive federal investigation that led to the indictments last week of three company executives on fraud charges and the ouster on July 24 of long-time chief executive Richard Scott. Frist, 58, who had been Columbia's vice chairman, replaced Scott. Bovender will replace David Vandewater, who resigned along with Scott under pressure from Columbia's board. "I am committed to operating this company in a manner that promotes the highest moral and ethical standards," Bovender said in a statement. "Our management team pledges its total cooperation with the federal government, all state governments and all other concerned parties in resolving past issues." Separately, two U.S. consumer groups Monday called on the attorneys general of all 50 states to impose a moratorium on acquisitions of non-profit hospitals by Columbia and Tenet Healthcare Corp., respectively, the largest and second-largest U.S. for-profit hospital companies. Consumers Union's West Coast Regional Office and Community Catalyst, of Boston, said they "urged that the moratorium be imposed pending resolution of all federal and state investigations involving these two companies." In addition to several federal agencies, state attorneys general in Texas and Alabama and one private law firm working with private insurers are investigating Columbia. Eleven shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the company in Tennessee and Delaware, alleging a litany of corporate abuses. The company's stock regained some ground Monday, closing up 31.25 cents to $33.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. It has fallen sharply from more than $40 a share in mid-July, when dozens of federal agents seized laboratory billing and home health care files from 33 Columbia facilities in six states as part of the investigation. Tenet, based in Santa Barbara, Calif., had been rumored to be in merger discussions with Columbia, even as the Columbia investigation was going on. But those rumors have been squelched in recent days under the weight of controversy facing both companies, analysts said. Tenet said last week it had reached an agreement to settle 700 lawsuits brought by former patients who claimed they were admitted to Tenet psychiatric hospitals without cause or were held against their will. The company did not disclose the dollar value of the settlement agreement. "The public needs and has a right to know about the kind of corporate citizens who are moving into their communities. With regard to Columbia and Tenet, there is still a big question mark," Julio Mateo, a lawyer with Consumers Union in San Francisco, said in a statement. Consumers Union publishes Consumer Reports magazine.

MCAT	Profit taking continued to weigh on CME lumber futures but prices ended only slightly lower as strong cash markets underpinned futures, traders said. The same pattern of the past few days persisted with futures declining early on the profit taking before firming late. There was cash-related buying late from people who want to take delivery of the September contract, they said. Cash sources noted that although the cash market is generally quiet, prices remain firm on demand for prompt delivery wood, they added. Random Lengths quoted cash spruce at $419 per tbf, up $5 from last Friday and $7 over the last midweek quote. Reduced concern over Hurricane Edouard prompted some of the early profit taking. Expectations the storm would turn more to the north partly eased concerns, they said. Lumber closed $2.20 to $0.20 per tbf lower with September off $0.70 at $413.20 and November off most at $369.00 per tbf. --Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725
MCAT	Asian stock markets were predominantly higher on Tuesday, but moves were muted and turnover poor as investors awaited fresh factors. Potential new leads included the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later on Tuesday, although markets have generally discounted any rate change. Australian stocks ended just firmer as the unveiling of the Federal budget, which forecast an underlying budget deficit of A$5.65 billion for fiscal 1996/97, came too late to hit trading. Tokyo stocks closed slightly higher, after drifting in tight ranges in mostly directionless trade for most of the day. Investors remained on the sidelines, and brokers expected the sluggish trend to continue for a while. The key 225-share Nikkei average ended up 20.60 points, or 0.10 percent, at 21,127.01. Its September futures gained 10 points to 21,180 by the end of the session. "The biggest reason why investors could not move was there were no factors to prompt fresh buying," said Kenzo Doi, senior analyst at Kokusai Securities Co Ltd. A rally in the utilities sector lifted Hong Kong stocks to a higher close, with the Hang Seng index closing above 11,300 points for the first time since March. The Hang Seng index ended 99.03 points higher at 11,312.51. "People are buying laggards. Most sectors have gained -- banks, properties, H-shares, red chips -- and now it is time for utilities which are still at a very low level," said Antony Mak, sales director at Vickers Ballas. Brisk trading in second liners drove Singapore shares to close up. Sentiment was partly lifted by strong July trade figures. The 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index was up 18.15 points at 2,123.81. Taiwan share prices rebounded from an early slide to close slightly higher on news that China had issued rules governing direct shipping links with estranged Taiwan, brokers said. The index ended up 9.93 points or 0.16 percent at 6,057.44. The Australian share market ended just firmer and well off its highs as cautious players cashed in gains ahead of the Federal budget. The All Ordinaries index ended up 3.2 points at 2,264.7. Jakarta's composite index rose 2.53 points to 539.61 points on active buying in secondaries and selected heavyweights. Thai stocks ended slightly higher after moving in negative territory for most of the session as a market support fund helped bolster the flagging bourse, brokers asid. The SET index ended 3.93 points higher at 1,071.41 on a thin 2.4 billion baht. The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index ended at 1,105.44, up 2.08 points, after moving in a four-point range. Among losing markets, Manila shares languished in negative territory and closed down 1.98 points at 3,090.69. Seoul was also lower and ended at a 33-month low in slow trading as overall depression erased early selective buying of theme-backed small-sized shares, brokers said. The composite stock index ended 6.61 points down at a provisional 793.91, the lowest closing since November 12, 1993. Bombay shares rebounded 33.89 points, or 1.03 percent, to 3,315.38. In late Tokyo trade, the dollar was at 107.87/92 yen and 1.4899/04 marks, against New York's Monday close of 107.77/84 yen and 1.4867/77 marks as players awaited the FOMC meeting. On SIMEX, October Brent futures were last traded at $20.75, down ten cents from London's settlement on Monday.

GCAT	Russian President Boris Yeltsin will make an official visit to Rome early next year, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Friday. Prodi told reporters after meeting the Russian President that he would visit Moscow in September and Yeltsin would make a return visit to Rome in January or February next year. "Yeltsin will come to Rome between January 15 and February 15," Prodi said The two leaders met ahead of a summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations. Prodi said the visits would give new impetus to relations between Russia and Italy, which he said were "very, very good but not wide ranging enough." He said he had raised the possibility of encouraging smaller Italian companies to develop business interests in Russia and that there was also scope to step up imports of Russian energy products into Italy.
CCAT	Investors in Asian countries are turning to Tokyo's property market, formerly notorious for its high prices, says Richard Mandel, managing director of the Japanese unit of U.S. real estate firm Kennedy-Wilson Inc. Mandel told Reuters in a recent interview that his California-based company could bring foreign investors into Japan's real estate market, currently suffering from a five-year tailspin, and reactivate trade. This should also help ease one of the Japanese financial industry's biggest headaches -- selling off land collateral to recover something from the huge bad loans run up by Japan's seven failed "jusen" mortgage firms, he said. "We are probably the only foreign company participating in the Japanese real estate market... Many foreign investors from Asia are coming over here, working with us to try to buy Japanese real estate," he said. Asian investors see Tokyo as a powerful world business centre and believe that real estate prices here have come down to attractive levels after plunging 75 percent from the peak reached in the early 1990s, he said. Japanese property prices went into a tailspin in the early 1990s when the nation's "bubble economy" era of soaring stock market and real estate prices came to an end. Mandel said that while Kennedy-Wilson has not concluded any deals since it started operations in Tokyo in 1995, negotiations are going on with Asian investors, focusing on commercial buildings and apartment buildings in central Tokyo with values of less than 10 billion yen ($89.2 million). "You can buy prime Japanese real estate much lower than you can buy in Hong Kong and Singapore," he said. Real estate industry sources say big Japanese investors such as life insurers and developers, which were aggressive buyers of land in the bubble era, are finding it hard to allocate new money for land transactions because they carry huge problem assets left from the collapse of the bubble. Meanwhile, they say banks and construction firms are reluctant to sell their real estate at current prices, and this has greatly decreased market liquidity. He said Japan should take a look at taxes on capital gains. Japan's real estate market needs many investors from all over the world to become a truly healthy market, but a major drawback is its capital gain tax on land transactions, he said. The company took part in helping the Resolution Trust Corp in the United States recover debts following the 1980s crisis at "savings and loan" mortgage associations, using its auction-marketing system. Mandel believes the system would be useful for selling jusen property. Mandel will soon leave Japan for New York. Ryosuke Homma, who will take over the Tokyo operation, said making use of the Internet could be a method of soliciting investors. In July, Japan set up the Housing Loan Administration Corp to recover, over the next 15 years, more than six trillion yen ($53.5 billion) worth of the jusen firms' problem loans in the form of real estate collateral. Earlier this month, several Japanese ministries set up a joint panel to work out measures to boost liquidity in the property market to facilitate collection of debt through collateralised real estate. Mandel said real estate sales by the Housing Loan Administration Corp would happen from the start of fiscal 1997, beginning on April 1, "and this will firmly set market prices" ($1=112 yen)
GCAT	Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived in Amman on Monday and went straight into talks with King Hussein on the latest crisis in peace talks with Israel, officials said. The crisis was touched off by a twin suicide bombing in Jerusalem's main Jewish market on Wednesday. The bombings killed 15 people including the two Arab attackers and plunged Arafat's already frosty relations with Israel's right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to an all-time low. Officials said Arafat would seek King Hussein's support in the face of Israeli pressure on him to crack down on Islamic militants after the bombings. After the bombings, Israel suspended peace talks with the PLO and sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip, disrupting Palestinian trade and preventing tens of thousands of Arab workers from reaching their jobs in the Jewish state. It also threatened to re-enter Palestinian self-rule areas to fight militants if Arafat did not do the job. Ahead of the Arafat-Hussein meeting, Jordan urged Israel to keep peace talks with the Palestinians alive, saying the alternative would be a "catastrophe" for the whole region. "This is a matter, we pray to God, will not happen because the alternative is a catastrophe for the whole region...We do not accept this talk (of ending the peace talks)," he said. "There is a great and pressing need for joint efforts to keep the peace process alive," he added. Netanyahu was quoted on Sunday as saying that Israel would not honour peace deals it signed with Arafat unless the Palestinian president cracked down on Islamic radicals. Tarawnah said the bombings should only toughen the resolve of the parties to the conflict to get the peace process back on track. Jordan, he said, was also working with Washington to formulate ideas for an initiative to serve as a basis for resumption of stalled peace talks, ahead of a visit by U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross to the region to try to defuse growing tension. Jordan privately supports the view that Israel has been footdragging on implementing its 1993 peace deals with the Palestinians and that the bombings were being exploited to backtrack on its peace commitments. Tarawnah attacked Israel for taking punitive security measures against the Palestinians, saying such steps were counterproductive and hindered the ability of Palestinians to stem terrorism. "Peace is in essence security, but there are other dimensions aside from security which should be taken into account, which relate directly to Palestinian rights and their aspirations from peace," Tarawnah added, saying Israel should treat the Palestinian Authority as a partner not an enemy. King Hussein has said the bloodshed could have been precipitated by growing frustrations with a stalled peace process and anger over an accelerated Jewish settlement drive in the West Bank. He has expressed increasing exasperation with Netanyahu's policies, publicly doubting his resolve to advance the peace process. Jordan is worried by the repercussions of renewed violence in Palestinian territories on its own stability. The kingdom's 4.2 million people have close ethnic ties with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
ECAT	Swiss National Bank chairman Hans Meyer said in an interview with a Swiss news agency that he expected Swiss growth to reach 1.5 percent in 1998. This would follow growth expected at 0.5 percent in 1997. He said that growth was expected to return gradually to a level of 2.0 percent by the start of the century. Meyer made his comments in an interview with Swiss news agency SDA, an SNB spokesman said. The interview was conducted on Wednesday. The SNB has said in the past that it expected growth of 0.5 percent in 1997, and also has said that it expected further improvements in 1998. Price stability, low interest rates, and the Swiss franc's decline were seen as creating a positive basis for growth. Major impetus was also expected to come from stronger growth in neighboring countries. Meyer has already said such factors are likely to help the economy, including the fact that the Swiss franc is roughly 10 percent lower than it was a year ago. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340
CCAT	British insurer Commercial Union Plc said on Tuesday that worldwide new business rose 21 percent to 1.58 billion stg in the first six months of 1997. New single premiums were up 17 percent to 1.22 billion stg over the period and new annual premiums up 38 percent to 154 million stg.   Chief executive John Carter described the performance as very good. "Our Netherlands company, Delta Lloyd, and our UK business produced strong growth and an excellent level of new business was achieved in Italy and Poland," he said. Single premium business at Delta Lloyd increased 51 percent to 120 million stg and annual premium new business 31 percent higher at 33 million stg. However, Commercial Union said that consumer uncertainty surrounding the recent elections and the reorganisation of the sales force in France had an adverse effect on sales there. Single premium sales in France amounted to 624 million stg, including a 295 million stg contribution from AFER, down 15 percent after adjusting for exchange rate movements. Annual premium sales were 11 million, down 30 percent. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5106
GCAT	Paris-Nice winner Laurent Jalabert of France and Belgium's world champion Johan Museeuw have escaped with no more than bruises and aches from their crash in the Milan-San Remo classic. "I've got nothing broken but I've got aches like you'd expect after such a fall," Jalabert told Monday's L'Equipe after doing two hours' training on Sunday. Museeuw, who bruised his shoulder, told the Belgian daily Het Nieuwsblad that he would probably be out of action for another two days but expected to take part in Wednesday's "Through Belgium" race. Jalabert, victim of an horrendous crash in the 1994 Tour de France, appeared to ride into Museeuw, bringing down several riders including Briton Max Sciandri in the sprint finish to Saturday's race. The Frenchman, who was not wearing a helmet, said he thought he was hit from behind. Jalabert was lucky to get away with no more than a bruised temple. "I went head first, I was afraid," he said. The crash brought back memories of Jalabert's collision with a gendarme at Armentieres in the Tour de France three years ago, which put him out for the rest of the season. Erik Zabel of Germany won the Paris-Nice race, the first of the season's World Cup series. Jalabert was 16th, one behind Sciandri, by virtue of a rarely-used rule whereby rider and cycle must be in contact on crossing the line. Jalabert and Sciandri were still in contact with their bikes despite the fall but Museeuw was not and he was placed 39th -- last in the group -- under the rules.

CCAT	Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland are poised to fall to fresh lows for the year, even as the rest of the UK bank sector seems certain to outperform the broad market, technical analysts said on Tuesday. "Banks as a whole looked good for a while, but it's not that nice, neat homogeneous sector any more. The Scotish banks broke down," said Robin Griffiths, an analyst with HSBC James Capel. He is bullish on the other major British banks, but has a sell recommendation on both Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland.   Royal Bank of Scotland shares peaked in mid-December at 658p. The shares have been slipping since, even as the UK bank sector shot ahead, leading blue chips into unchartered territory. Charters said Royal Bank of Scotland shares look set to test critical support at 460p, a level not seen in almost a year. If chart support at 460p is breached, Charters, who also rates the stock a sell, forecasts a further decline to 400p. "If 460p goes, then I'd say we'll see 400p in three to six months," he said. "The other mainstream banks look okay ... they look good," Charters added.   Shares in the Bank of Scotland, up 1/2p to 255p, also have traded below their 200-day moving average since early June. Those shares could fall as low as 200p, said Griffiths. "That's major support ... falling to 200p would retrace its entire '95 rise," he added. --Debra Sherman, London newsroom +44 171 542 4026
GCAT	The opposition Centre Party plans to sumbit next week an interpellation against the left-right-green government, the Centre Party parliamentary group said in a statement on Tuesday. It was not yet clear exactly when the interpellation would be presented in parliament, an official at the legislature said. The government must respond, and an interpellation debate leads by law to a parliamentary vote of confidence in the government. The five coalition parties have a wide majority, 142-seats in the 200-strong house, where the Speaker does not vote. In the statement, the Centre Party said the cabinet's policy was dividing the nation. The government was not even trying to combat unemployment, it was making those worst off even poorer by cutting social benefits and making the rich richer by lowering taxes, it said. If based on the themes raised by the Centre Party, the interpellation debate will highlight the differences of opinion on domestic economic policy priorities between the government parties and the opposition just a month before municipal and European Parliament elections on October 20. --Peter Starck, Helsinki Newsroom  +358 - 0 - 680 50 245
MCAT	CBOT corn futures closed mixed and was seeking direction amid conflicting signals from U.S. Midwest weather patterns and weather forecasts, traders said. "There are a lot of jitters in the market about weather. It's not all in the U.S. but also in China and India," said Smith Barney analyst Dale Gustafson. There were concerns about reports of dry weather in portions of China's grain growing region and the Indian monsoon was showing instability. In the U.S. there were forecasts early Wednesday for hotter weather by the weekend but midday outlooks from private forecasters showed more rain on the horizon. "Weather was going to be pretty warm this weekend. There was definite rain in northern parts of Iowa and in Minnesota and Wisconsin but they haven't been that dry," said Jerry Gidel, analyst for Dean Witter. "But southern and southwest Iowa on into Missouri it's going to stay pretty dry." Meteorologists early Wednesday said temperatures would climb above 90 degrees Fahrenheit in the U.S. Midwest this weekend and subside by early next week. Corn closed 3/4 cent lower to 3/4 higher, with September down 1/4 at $2.47-1/4.   Weather Services Corp Wednesday said high temperatures would range from the upper 80s to upper 90s Saturday through Monday and would be cooler Tuesday. This pattern will stress pollinating corn in some of the dry pockets of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Missouri, WSC said. Other areas will be generally favorable. The U.S. corn crop was pollinating slower-than-expected which led to increased vulnerability of the crop being harmed by a hot spell, analysts and traders have said. The crop as of Sunday was 21 percent pollinated, below the 22 percent a year ago and well below the 32 percent average pace. Strong commercial stopping of deliveries posted Wednesday against the expired July contract also was mentioned. "Cargill stopped beans, wheat and corn," a trader said. There were 590,000 bushels of corn posted Wednesday for delivery on the July and the Cargill Investor Services house account stopped all of it, according to the CBOT. Dean Witter bought four million bushels of December, Refco Inc bought seven million bushels of December and sold four million December and Merrill Lynch Futures sold two million December, traders said. In spread dealings, Cargill Inc did one million December/September at 1/2 cent, premium December, traders said. Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 50,000 contracts, below the 53,840 traded Tuesday. In corn options, Refco Inc sold 500 December $2.10 puts at 5/8 cent, sold 500 December $2.20 puts at 1-3/4 to 1-5/8 cents and bought 300 December $2.40 puts at 8-1/4 to 8-1/2 cents, traders said. Tenco Inc bought 500 September $2.50 puts at 8-1/2 cents and bought 500 September $2.30 calls at 19 cents, traders said. Corn options volume was estimated at 16,000 contracts, slightly above the 15,956 traded Tuesday. ((Sam Nelson 312-408-8721))
GCAT	German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Monday the European Union would not allow Tehran to dictate the terms of the return of EU ambassadors to Iran. All EU states except Greece recalled their ambassadors from Tehran after a German court ruled in April that Iran's top leaders had ordered the 1992 assassination of four Iranian Kurdish dissidents in a Berlin restaurant. Iran, which strongly rejected the court's conclusion, has said the envoys can return to Tehran but has indicated the German ambassador must be the last. "The German government, along with the other EU member states, is of the opinion that discrimination is out of the question when it comes to the return of the ambassadors," Kinkel said in a statement. "For this reason, a return of the EU ambassadors has not yet come about. We cannot and will not let the Iranian side dictate the conditions for this," said the minister, who also thanked Germany's European partners for their solidarity over the issue. Kinkel made clear he was in favour of a return of the envoys, although not at the price demanded by Tehran. "After a longer pause for thought, the attempt should be made to get in contact with one another again," he said.
ECAT	Canada's Finance Minister Paul Martin on Sunday delivered an upbeat assessment of the prospects for the Canadian economy next year. "The outlook for 1997 and beyond is bright,' he told the International Monetary Fund's policy-making Interim Committee. "Our progress toward deficit reduction and in keeping inflation low has translated into sharply lower interest rates." The IMF has forecast that Canada's economic growth will pick up to 3.2 percent next year from 1.4 percent in 1996. "Putting Canada's finances on a sound footing is the cornerstone of our approach," Martin said. "Deficit reduction is not a priority only of the federal government," he added. "Seven of Canada's 10 provincial governments achieved balanced budgets or surpluses in the most recent fiscal year." While some analysts have voiced concern that cutting budget deficits when growth is weak is counter-productive, Martin said many nations do not have the luxury of postponing those decisions because their finances are in such bad shape. Martin reiterated Canada's support for the sale of a modest amount of IMF gold to help finance stepped-up aid for debt-ridden poor nations. "I would like to see the IMF Executive Board endorse the sale of five million ounces of gold sooner rather than later," he said. Any sale, he added, should be carried out "in a gradual and transparent manner. This will ensure that the impact on world gold markets is negligible."
GCAT	Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has made an unprecedented business pact with opposition Moslem fundamentalists, an overture that may lead to political cooperation as well, officials said at the weekend. Mahathir and Nik Aziz Nik Mat, head of the ruling Parti Islam se-Malaysia (PAS) in northeastern Kelantan state, on Friday witnessed the signing of a petrochemical deal between a company controlled by Mahathir's party and a Kelantan oil firm. It was a rare show of unity between bitter political rivals in Malaysia's only opposition-ruled state. "We may be political enemies, but it doesn't mean we can't be business partners," Mahathir said at the signing ceremony in Kota Baru, Kelantan's capital. The prime minister and his allies held their first ever dialogue with Nik Aziz and PAS leaders after the signing. Government and corporate figures aligned to the prime minister's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) said after the talks that Mahathir may even extend the cooperation to politics, if the fundamentalist PAS toned down its "extremism". "I think the time has come...the PM is willing to work with PAS and Nik Aziz is singing praises of him," said Hassan Harun, chairman of KUB Malaysia Bhd, the UMNO-controlled cooperative that signed the petrochemical deal with Kelantan. Nik Aziz, an Islamic preacher who has ruled Kelantan since 1990, surprised political analysts last week when he described Mahathir in a television interview as "an exemplary leader of the Moslem world", and called on Kelantan people to turn out in full force to welcome him. Speaking to reporters in Kota Baru after Mahathir's arrival, Nik Aziz added: "The rivalry between the two parties had, at times, gone overboard." "The situation would be less tense if there was more cooperation. While we differ politically, we should not become extremists," he said. Since coming to power in highly conservative Kelantan, the PAS has proposed Islamic punishment for criminals that calls for stoning of adulterers and amputation of limbs for thieves. The party has banned liquor, gambling, lipstick and unisex hair salons. It requires separate check-out lines for men and women at supermarkets and has all but banned night-time entertainment outlets. Mahathir said he was open to bringing PAS into the government. "Nothing is impossible in politics. Most of the people in our government used to be our enemies once." Mahathir said the fate of PAS, which has gone no further than conquering Kelantan in 40 years, was in its own hands. "If they want to be friendly with us, we are friendly. If they want to be enemies with us, then we become enemies. If they want to shoot us, we shoot back," he said. Asked about a political deal with Mahathir, Nik Aziz said: "At the moment the mood is happy...I would like to take some time before I comment further." Despite producing some of the country's best businessmen and professionals, Kelantan has remained one of Malaysia's poorest states because the rivalry between UMNO and PAS has thwarted investors and projects from coming to the state, analysts said. Monthly income in Kelantan was 1,081 ringgit in 1995 against a national average of 2,007 ringgit, state officials said. The 2.0 billion-ringgit agreement to build a petrochemical plant in Kelantan over the next five years could be "the catalyst for the future development of Kelantan", Harun said.
ECAT	The Slovak trade deficit widened to nearly 28 billion crowns year-on-year in the first four months of 1997, prompting analyst calls for central bank moves to ease its tight monetary policy. The statistical bureau (SUSR) on Tuesday said the trade deficit totalled 27.908 billion crowns for the January-April period, up from 21.498 billion for the same period in 1996. SUSR said the deficit was boosted by a large increase in imports, mainly cars and other vehicles, coupled with a slowing in export growth. But analysts said the figure also showed that the future development of country's economy might be in peril unless the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) softened its strict monetary policy, characterised by high interest rates. "The widening of the trade gap is, simply said, very bad considering the current pressure on our currency," Vladimir Kuklis of CSOB bank told Reuters. "The NBS should change its policy before the economy stops producing and therefore exporting," he said. The NBS has been fighting to keep the Slovak crown strong setting the currency above market rates by its daily fixing while keeping the market short of liquidity to prevent foreign borrowing of crowns for short-selling. "I can imagine decreasing bank minimum reserves and softening the restrictive effective rather than enourmously high rates which, anyway, did not make the crown less immune against the attack we have seen in these days," Kuklis said. SUSR said exports totalled 95.270 billion crowns, an increase of 16.7 percent over January-April 1996. Imports, led by a 37.5 percent rise in fossil fuels and mineral oils, rose by 19.5 percent year-on-year in the first four months of 1997, totalling 123.178 billion crowns. Technological imports for upgrading the ageing Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear power plant and completion of the Mochovce nuclear plant also figured heavily in the deficit. Iron and rolled steel were the main exports, rising 13.4 percent year-on-year, while the fastest rising item on the export side were cars which were up 118 percent against January-April period of 1996. "There are more questions over the future of the entire economy...than we expected just a few weeks before, due to the latest developments," said Peter Krutil of Creditanstalt. Added Kuklis: "If the gap were the result of high technology imports everything would be O.K. in a type of economy such as ours. But if we accelerate the plunge by buying mobile phones." The Czech Republic remained Slovakia's main trading partner, accounting for 27.9 percent of exports and 23.2 percent of imports. Exports to Germany accounted for 24 percent, followed by Austria and Italy, with 6.3 and 5.4 percent, respectively. -- Bratislava Newsroom, 421-7-521-8402

ECAT	A New Jersey Senate committee on Monday cancelled hearings set for Tuesday on a controversial $3 billion pension obligation bond deal, a state Senator said. The delay came at the request of Senate Republicans, according to Sen. Robert Littell, R-Sussex, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee. Littell, who opposes the pension bond plan, said in a telephone interview that supporters of the proposal wanted more time to win the backing of key unions in the state. The New Jersey Education Assocation, the state's 150,000-member teachers union, has already said it supports the idea, but Littell said several other unions are holding out for more concessions from the state. Littell also said hearings in the state Assembly originally set for Thursday would likely be postponed, in part because state Assembly members want the Senate to vote before taking up the idea themselves. A spokeswoman for state Treasurer Brian Clymer, who was scheduled to testify at the Senate hearing, said the administration had not been told when it might be rescheduled. The bond plan, proposed earlier this year by Gov. Christine Whitman, is intended to eliminate a $4.2 billion unfunded liability in the state's pension system. The bonds, in combination with a move to tap $1.3 billion in a pension fund surplus, would also free up about $650 million in one-shot budget savings. Although State House watchers have said there appears to be enough support to pass the legislation needed for the bond sale, Littell said he expects it to fail. "I'm convinced there's more than enough to defeat it," he said. Littell said he is not opposed to Whitman's proposal to reclassify a portion of the pension system's surplus and use it to pay down some of the unfunded liability and for budget savings. In fact, he said that strategy should be used to avoid the need for bonds entirely, by simply waiting for the pension system's investment strategy to continue building a surplus large enough to wipe out the liability. Whitman and state Treasurer Brian Clymer have said turning the unfunded liability into a bond debt would capitalize on the current low interest rate environment and dramatically reduce the long-term payments required to pay off the debt. Clymer also said using up the surplus would be irresponsible, since it is used to protect the pension fund against downturns in investment revenues. The state last month selected Merrill Lynch & Co to underwrite the taxable bond deal if the Legislature gives its approval. --Steven Dickson, 212-859-1652

CCAT	Loss-making airline Ansett Australia said on Wednesday it would not survive unless it made major changes to turn the business around. Ansett executive chairman Rod Eddington, in his first major speech since his appointment last year, said the airline needed to sell out of resorts and other non-core assets, even if this meant wearing a loss. He said Ansett must free up cash and improve its operating performance to fund the airline's expanding core business, including eight new aircraft it needed to rationalise its fleet.   The contract for the new aircraft orders, said to be worth over A$2 billion, is a close contest between European aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie and Boeing Co. Ansett is owned equally by Air New Zealand and media group News Corp. In a frank assessment, Eddington called Ansett an excellent airline but a poor business which needed to cut unit costs but at the same time increase customer service. "Unless Ansett changes, it won't survive in the medium to long term," he told the National Aviation Press Club.   "There's no point in taking any business to the market until it's in pretty robust shape. Ansett is a long, long way away from that now," he said. "It takes time ... it takes two to three years, not two to three months," he added. The decision on Ansett's new long-term fleet plan, expected to be made by the board early in the second half of 1997, will be crucial to Ansett's future, Eddington said. It is a close call between Airbus's A330-200 and Boeing's 767-300. "It's the closest one I have been part of," he said.   Eddington foreshadowed another poor result for the year to June 30, 1997, saying that profits were "thin on the ground". He would not even discuss Ansett's level of gearing which, according to the airline's balance sheet at June 30 last year, means that for every A$1 of equity, Ansett owes A$9 in debt. "If we were floating at the moment, it would make things a little difficult," Eddington said. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the country's competition watchdog, could also make life difficult for Ansett's alliance with Air New Zealand.   ACCC approval will be needed for the two carriers to go ahead and work together on ground services, information technology, procurement and marketing and sales, he said. "This work will ultimately lead to an application for ACCC authorisation," Eddington said. -- Melbourne bureau 613-9286-1421
ECAT	Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said on Tuesday that he was convinced year-on-year inflation in Italy would fall to below two percent when preliminary April figures are released next week. The March year-on-year level was 2.2 percent, the lowest since 1969, and preliminary consumer price data for April from 11 Italian cities are due to be released on April 21 and 22. ISTAT will publish final CPI data for April on May 6.   "Inflation is diminishing. We are expecting the data for April (next week) and I am convinced that we will go below two percent," Ciampi told reporters at the lower house of parliament. Italian shares and bond futures have all firmed on expectations of an April year-on-year rate of 1.9 percent and a view that the fall could pave the way for the Bank of Italy to cut interest rates. Traders also noted that Tuesday's February industrial production data, showing an unadjusted fall of 3.8 percent against a 6.4 percent decline in January, also boosted hopes for a rate cut. Ciampi called the figure "positive". --Rome newsroom +39 6 678 2505
CCAT	South Korea's Ssangyong is to export 1.8 million barrels of gasoline to oil giant Saudi Arabia, but traders on Friday said this was no panacea for the oversupplied Asian market. Analysts estimate the exports will only soak up part of Asia's surplus production. "At least some cargoes will move out of Asia so there will be less pressure," a gasoline trader said. "But I don't think it will have a major impact with the market so depresssed."   The Hawaii-based energy group East-West Centre estimated that Asia production would produce a 75,000 barrels-per-day surplus (bpd) in 1997. South Korea's Ssangyong Oil Refining Co said Friday it would export the gasoline to Saudi Aramco over six months from this July. Aramco, the world's largest oil company in terms of reserves, has a 35-percent share in the 443,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) South Korean refinery and provides the bulk of Ssangyong's crude requirements.   "We have had a close relationship with Aramco since 1991 and this deal won't change much but will help sustain our relationship," said a spokesman for Ssangyong. He also said the agreement was Ssangyong's first long-term contract to export gasoline as well as its first gasoline term sale to an oil-producing country. For Saudi Arabia, the deal will help it relieve an imbalance in its production of gasoline. Most Saudi Arabian demand is in the capital Riyadh and the populous Eastern Province, but most production is on its western seaboard.   Aramco has a $3 billion plan to upgrade its major oil refineries to keep pace with soaring domestic demand, but imports can make economic sense. The kingdom's population of 17 million consumes some 200,000-220,000-bpd of gasoline but demand is expected to rise to 260,000-bpd by the end of the decade. Aramco regularly imports gasoline from its Gulf neighbour Bahrain, but has also sourced some requirements from Asia, industry sources said. "It will buy what is cheap and close," a trader said.   Gasoline has gradually been drifting out of Asia because of the surplus production, mainly from Thailand and Korea. It has been supplied as far afield as Africa, Australia and the U.S. West coast. In April, South Korean refiner LG-Caltex, a joint-venture between the LG-Group  and the U.S.'s Caltex made its first sale to the Middle East, selling a cargo to Aramco. South Korea gasoline exports were boosted to up to 1.5 million barrels per month in April when Ssangyong started up its 50,000-bpd residue fluid catalytic cracker (RFCC).   After its deal with Aramco, Ssangyong which normally has one to two 300,000-barrel cargoes available for export each month, may disappear from the spot market, a trader said. "It depends on domestic demand," he said. South Korea has been absent from the spot market during the summer months and is not expected to re-emerge until September. --Singapore newsroom (+65-870-3086) With Contributions from Jean Yoon in Seoul
CCAT	As you work on your business plan, there are numerous issues you should be preparing to discuss with your attorney and accountant before launching your business. As the experienced entrepreneur knows, good advice is priceless, but the cost of bad advice can be endless. With that in mind, search for the best advisers you can find, while simultaneously preparing yourself to elicit their best advice. Where to start? Ask around for recommendations. But keep a critical view. "Usually what happens is, people ask a friend who's a lawyer or accountant. If you don't detest the person and they're not going to bankrupt you, you go with them. That's not necessarily the best way," said Kevin Sheridan, a partner in the New York law firm Roberts, Sheridan & Kotel, which specialises in advising new business owners. He suggests you ask for examples of other new businesses they've assisted and if they can put you in touch with the people involved. "You want someone who's asking insightful questions and listening to the answers," Sheridan said. He recommends finding both an attorney and an accountant who specialise in small businesses. "I often tell people, 'Don't just rely on your lawyer's advice.' A lawyer can't be everything to everyone, and a lawyer's advice is often more expensive than a small-business acccountant's." Sheridan recommends hiring an attorney who doesn't just set up small businesses, but rather one who does other work as well. "A lot of (legal) practices just crank them out. There will be much less ability or sensitivity to the specific needs of the business," he said. While conducting your search for consulting expertise, you will help yourself and likely improve your adviser's performance if you familiarize yourself with the specific issues involved. In addition to the critical choice of the appropriate business entity, be it sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation or any of the numerous variations, there are a host of additional "housekeeping issues" involved in setting up a business. Jay Nathanson, a principal at the law firm Rosenblum, Goldenhersh, Silverstein & Zafft, P.C. in Clayton, Mo., years ago drew up an agenda for establishing a general business corporation. While some items may not apply in other states, it offers a basic checklist approach for both attorney and client. The agenda covers issues ranging from choosing and registering a name; getting business permits and an employer identification number; setting up buy-sell agreements, restrictive stock arrangements and non-competition agreements; determining the method of accounting; terms of employment, fringe benefits and payroll; to the need to conduct business in the corporate name and to keep minutes of shareholder and director meetings. "It's rare that I get somebody that comes in here and knows absolutely nothing and is going into a brand new business for the first time," said Nathanson. "They know about insurance, a CPA, licensing, and the like." But for those who do not, and especially for the more complicated issues, an expert's input is essential. "You want to make sure that if someone leaves, they don't steal all the company secrets and good will," said Nathanson. While you most likely don't want to invest the time and effort needed to earn your own law or accounting degree, you would do well to read up on these issues so you can get the most for your money spent on expert advice. Questions or comments on the Newbiz column can be sent via e-mail to Daniel.Grebler(at)Reuters.Com   The following is an abbreviated version of an agenda for general business incorporation compiled by Jay Nathanson, a principal at the law firm Rosenblum, Goldenhersh, Silverstein & Zafft, P.C. in Clayton, Mo. 1.

GCAT	The top prosecutor of Honduras said on Wednesday that his country is a haven for money laundering. "In Honduras it's easy to launder money, the system allows it," Edmundo Orellana told reporters. "It's permitted because there is no law in Honduras that obligates a Honduran to explain the origin of his wealth." Honduran authorities estimate that $300 million in illegal drug profits is laundered through the country each year. Money laundering is not classified as an offence in Honduras, although legislators have been working on a bill to outlaw it since last year.

MCAT	The Chinese yuan closed up at 8.2955 on Friday due to a technical rebound after it fell to a one-month low of 8.2962 on Thursday against the U.S. dollar in Shanghai, dealers said. They said comments by president of the central bank on foreign exchange reserves had no impact on the yuan's movement. Dai Xianglong, the governor of the People's Bank of China, said on Friday at an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-Hong Kong Monetary Authority conference in Hong Kong that China's foreign exchange reserves amounted to $110 billion at the end of February.   "The number showed the central bank is continuing to buy dollars on the foreign exchange market," one dealer said. "Such activity is likely to increase in the near future, which will further depress the yuan." The weighted average price on Thursday was 8.2957. The yuan opened higher at 8.2956 and consolidated around 8.2960 for most of the session, hitting an intraday low of 8.2965 and a high of 8.2940. Trading was slow, dealers said. "Today's gains are a technical rebound after Thursday's falls," said a second dealer.   Dealers said they expected the yuan to move around 8.2960 early next week. The yuan closed down at 6.8540 from 6.8245 against 100 Japanese yen and up at 1.0708 from 1.0722 against the Hong Kong dollar.
ECAT	Gavyn Davies, chief international economist at Goldman Sachs International, said he did not think there was a convincing case for substantially tightening UK fiscal policy and he did not expect a major increase in the tax burden in the forthcoming budget. Goldman Sachs and the Institute for Fiscal Studies said in their "green budget" that higher interest rates would be a better method of reining in consumer spending. Davies said the budget plans which new Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown had inherited from the ousted Conservatives already contained a sgnificant fiscal tightening. "We are tightening by about one percent of GDP per year at the moment," he told a presentation on the green budget. "There is quite a lot of fiscal restraint in the piepeline." Davies added that he was not convinced that there was a water-tight case for raising the tax burden. No date has yet been set for the budget but it is expected by early July. David Walton, director of UK economic research at Goldman Sachs, said the best way historically to dent consumer confidence was through higher interest rates. "To avoid overheating, the policy stance needs to be tight enough to slow the economy to a trend rate or below in 1998," Walton said. "Base rates may need to rise to 7.25-7.50 percent over the next year unless fiscal policy is tightened significantly further in the forthcoming budget." UK official interest rates are currently at 6.25 percent, having been increased by 25 basis points base lending rates three weeks ago. Davies said consumer taxes would need to rise by around nine billion pounds to reduce base rate pressure by one percentage point. "That seems to us a bit implausible. It doesn't look politically feasible," he added. Davies is widely tipped to be appointed a deputy governor of the Bank of England. --Richard Murphy +44 171 542 5109
ECAT	The NTC UK consumer industries' leading indicator fell for the second consecutive month in January, NTC economic and financial research said on Thursday. The fall, caused by slower growth in TV advertising revenues, declining growth in job centre vacancies, and consumer expectations of higher interest rates, follows record highs hit in the second half of last year, NTC said. "The indicator tends to move ahead of the general economic cycle by eleven months.... The recent downturn in the indicator signals a potential weakening in the rate of economic growth at the end of the year or early 1998." The NTC's indicator, which fell to 108.2 in January from 108.3 in December and record highs of 108.4 in October and November last year, includes a broad range of economic variables from the consumer sector. Taken together, these have a track record of providing advance indication of turning points in levels of consumers' economic activity, NTC said. -- Kate Kelland, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7708
GCAT	Belarus lashed out at the West on Tuesday, accusing a group of European ambassadors based in the capital Minsk of gross interference in its internal affairs. The leading commentator on state television, which is controlled by President Alexander Lukashenko, said the ambassadors of Britain, Italy, Germany and France had issued a joint statement to the foreign ministry on Monday. "The initiative is a gross interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state," Alexander Zimovski said on the main evening news bulletin, saying he had only received a text of the statement on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the British embassy confirmed a group of ambassadors had launched an initiative on Monday but gave few details and declined to comment on the protest. "The ambassador did go to the foreign ministry...and expressed concern about recent developments here and their implications," she said by telephone. The other embassies were not immediately available for comment. Zimovksi, who heads a flagship current affairs programme on Sundays, is considered an informal spokesman for Lukashenko, who was due to meet President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on Wednesday. The two leaders plan to discuss integration between their two states, which were split by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the political situation in Belarus, a Kremlin spokesman said on Tuesday. The 41-year-old Lukashenko, who has been accused by critics of taking an increasingly authoritarian line since coming to power two years ago, has said that Yeltsin had expressed support for his plan to hold a referendum to extend his term. The commentator said the diplomats had criticised as undemocratic Lukashenko's moves to muster support for the referendum by holding an "All-Belarus" meeting on Saturday. The meeting is part of Lukashenko's efforts to push through his plans to hold the referendum on November 7 which he hopes will give him a new five-year tenure into the next century. Opposition members of parliament, who voted on Friday to go ahead with a separate referendum on November 24 that could abolish the post of president altogether, have said the meeting will be attended only by functionaries loyal to Lukashenko.

CCAT	Shares in recently-unbundled South African firm Malbak Ltd were up 4.72 percent on moderate turnover Thursday as an earlier cautionary spurred talk it was a takeover target. At 0850 GMT Malback was changing hands at 710 cents, 32 cents higher on the day after 428,300 shares had changed hands. "The rumor's pretty well known in the market that Rembrandt is bidding for Malbak," said one share dealer. Malbak earlier warned it was in talks that might have an effect on the share price.   The dealer noted of Thursday's total volume, about 225,000 shares were traded in one overnight deal, generally an indication of a foreign trade. South Africa's Business Times newspaper reported on Sunday that it was "common knowledge in the market" that Remgro (Rembrandt) was keen to buy Malbak and merge their packaging interests. Another dealer said a few players had pulled their sell orders after the cautionary, which might be inflating bid prices. An analyst who asked not to be named said a fully priced bid for Malbak would have to be at 700 cents. Remgro's packaging operations are held largely through a 30 percent stake in Printpak and a 17 percent stake in Lenco Holdings Ltd, the Business times said. Lenco's stock surged or 17 percent or 105 cents to 720 cents -- a new year high -- in light trade. Malbak's primary assets since the unbundling are a 68 percent stake in Kohler Ltd and a 64 percent interest in U.K-listed MY Holdings Plc. Remgro shares were last traded at 4,595 cents, down five cents. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003

Prices were 0.8 to 1.6 yen per kg lower, with the benchmark March 1997 contract down 1.3 yen at 135.9. The yen's weaker sentiment against the dollar encouraged investors to buy in the morning but technical selling from individual investors emerged, they said. "We're watching for when local rubber stocks will start falling," a brokerage house trader said.

The new shares will be allotted to investors who own Hokkoku Bank shares at the end of January 31, 1997. The bank will allocate 0.1 new share for every one share. Applications for the new shares should be made between March 5-17, 1997, and the payment is due on March 31, 1997. Hokkoku shares closed at 800 yen on Wednesday, down six yen from Tuesday's close. Hokkoku Bank is based in Kanazawa, Ishikawa prefecture, 300 kilometres northwest of Tokyo.
ECAT	Mexico's first half government surplus has surged 463 percent to 29 billion pesos compared with the first half of last year, Reforma daily said on Tuesday without citing its source. The figure compares with a government surplus in the year-ago period of 4.2 billion pesos, the paper said. Reforma said the giant surplus was partly due to a 14.5 percent increase in income, which climbed to 243 billion pesos, while expenses rose just 3.3 percent in the first half to 214 billion pesos. In the first six months of 1996, the government earned 172.1 billion pesos and spent 167.9 billion, Reforma said. Mexico's Deputy Finance Minister Martin Werner told Reuters recently that the government would register a fiscal deficit in the second half of the year and would launch more longer-term debt on the domestic market to finance the expected deficit. The Finance Ministry has estimated a deficit of about 0.5 percent of GDP in 1997. ((--Timna Tanners, Mexico City newsroom +525 728-7903))
CCAT	Hong Kong utilities stocks rose on Monday on defensive buying, with investors switching to the sector from property counters due to uncertainty over the local property market, brokers said. Brokers said investors were worried about possible measures that may be imposed by the future Hong Kong government to curb speculation in property market. "The property sector is expected to underperform the market in the short run due to uncertainty over the property market," said Sean Li, associate director at Amsteel Securities. "Investors switching out from property to utilities fueled demand for the utilities stocks," Li said. The Hang Seng utilities sub-index was up 2.23 percent at midday, against a 0.66 percent gain for the properties sub-index and a 1.20 percent rise for the overall Hang Seng index. Brokers said demand for shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd led the rise of the utilities. Hongkong Telecom shares rose HK$0.35 to HK$16.70 at midday. "It is a kind of defensive and rotational buying which boosted demand for utilities, following the recent strength on banks and conglomerates, and the mixed view on property," said Michael Ng, dealing director at Sassoon Securities. Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd rose HK$1.15 to HK$30.60, Hongkong Ferry (Holdings) Co Ltd rose HK$1.05 to HK$15.90, China Light & Power Co Ltd rose HK$0.50 to HK$42.80, and Hong Kong & China Gas Co Ltd rose HK$0.40 to HK$14.75. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6370.  http://www.hk97.com
ECAT	The U.S. Treasury has overstated the inflation-adjusted cost of federal borrowing costs, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said on Tuesday. "When computing net interest costs on the outstanding bonds that make up the federal debt, the Treasury ignores real capital gains and losees, that is, changes in prices as a result of inflation and changes in interest rates," a study to be soon published by the Chicago Fed said. The study, available in New York, was conducted by Chicago Fed economist George Hall and Chicago Fed consultant and University of Chicago economics professor Thomas Sargent.   Hall and Sargent recalculated the cost of federal borrowing by taking into account the real capital gains and losses and found that "the true inflation-adjusted borrowing costs of the government are substantially lower and more variable than the Treasury reports." The authors said the miscalculation affects issues related to government borrowings -- from the new inflation-indexed bonds to the proposed balanced budget agreement. The study found that in 11 of the past 35 years, inflation was higher than the interest rates the U.S. government paid on its debt.   "During these 11 years, the government actually paid a negative real rate of interest on its debt," said the researchers who also noted the risks inherent to "playing with the yield curve." "Issuing short-maturity debt when short-maturity yields are low and issuing long-maturity debt when long-maturity yields are low ... amounts to betting against financial markets on future movements of interest rates and inflation," they said, pointing out the "two movements are notoriously hard to predict." Hall and Sargent found that the U.S. Treasury could have slowed the growth of the U.S. debt and lowered the debt services by issuing more long-term securities in 1960-80 and more short-term instruments after 1989.

ECAT	Mexico's Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz on Friday gave an upbeat forecast for the economy over the year ahead and predicted that increasing domestic and foreign investment would be the engine for growth. "What we are seeing is a strong investment process on the part of both domestic and foreign investors and I think this is going to be the largest single contribution to growth in 1997," he said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Mexico plunged into recession in 1995 after a shock peso devaluation required an International Monetary Fund and U.S. bailout package to haul it back from the brink of collapse. Gross domestic product (GDP) plummeted 6.9 percent in 1995, but preliminary figures show an export-led recovery has brought growth of 4.6 percent last year. Official forecasts predict 4.0 percent growth for 1997, but Ortiz has said that this was a conservative estimate and that the level could well prove higher. "We're not revising official forecasts, but most private sector analysts predict that the economy will be growing at between 4.5 and 5.0 percent," he said on Friday. "I wouldn't argue with them." The government has set itself a 1997 inflation target of 15 percent, and while some analysts predict a level closer to 18 percent, Ortiz said he was standing by the official target. "I think it is feasible," he said. Fears that inflation might be trending upwards were sparked by December's monthly inflation figure which climbed to 3.2 percent from 1.52 percent in November. But Ortiz said this was a one-off. "Inflation ticked up in December...that was a once-and-for-all effect because of some price adjustments," he said. "I think generally inflation will be substantially lower from that of December." He predicted that February's level would be easily below two percent. Some investors are concerned that Mexico's hard-won recovery may also be eroded by rising imports after preliminary data released last week showed exports outpaced imports by only $220 million in December. But Ortiz was unfazed, adding growth in imports was not surprising. "It's something to be expected since the economy is growing strongly," he said. "It's good that imports are growing, particularly imports of capital goods, because that shows that the investment process is coming along." Mexico last week impressed foreign investors with an unexpected early repayment of $5 billion it received as emergency loans from the United States and the IMF. Ortiz said other early payments could follow. "We have repaid our debts to the U.S. in full, but we have still a substantial amount debt with the IMF, and we will try to repay the IMF earlier if possible, if market conditions allow us," he said. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 2734

GCAT	Mali's President Alpha Oumar Konare will have at least one challenger in the impoverished West African nation's presidential election on May 11, despite opposition calls for a boycott. Konare, who resisted opposition calls for this year's national election timetable to be frozen after chaotic parliamentary polls on April 13, will be up against businessman Mamadou Maribatrou Diaby. Diaby and his Unity, Development and Progress Party (PUDP) have asked their supporters in a statement broadcast on state television to vote in the election, which eight previously declared candidates have decided to boycott. This year's elections, only the second multi-party national polls since independence in 1960, are a test of how deeply democracy has taken root after a widely praised 1992 democratic transition. Konare had been due to face nine challengers on May 4 but put back the date by a week. He launched his campaign on April 29, saying he could not postpone the poll longer than that as the constitution required a newly elected president by June 8. Serious organisational problems disrupted the April 13 elections, during which Malians turned out in force to vote only to be frustrated by lack of ballot papers and problems with voter cards and lists. The constitutional court in the former French colony scrapped the results citing irregularities. No date has been set for a repeat of polling for a new 147-seat parliament. Municipal elections had been planned for June 1. Konare, a historian elected in 1992, has steered the country on a course of economic liberalisation, winning praise from the World Bank and the United States for his efforts. Mali's opposition is grouped mainly in two alliances. The Front for Change and Democracy (FCD) includes dissidents from Konare's ADEMA alliance and politicians portraying themselves as heirs to the tradition of independence leader Modibo Keita, a nationalist and hardline socialist. The Rally of Patriotic Forces (RFP) includes supporters of the former single party and jailed former dictator Moussa Traore, whose 1991 overthrow cleared the way for democratic reforms.
GCAT	Standing near Sweden's Royal Palace on a cold wintry night, Franco cast his heavy baited line into the freezing waters that run through the centre of Stockholm. "I've caught around 500 salmon in Stockholm over the past 20 years," says Franco, an Italian who moved to Sweden more than 30 years ago. "Here's my most recent catch," he said, proudly displaying the one that didn't get away -- a four kg (8.82 lb) beauty. Shortly afterwards, another angler caught a 35 cm (13.7 inch) sea trout which he promptly released. "It's rather small," says Franco. "Most fishermen release salmon or sea trout that are less than 50 cm (19.7 inches)." Every night throughout the year, anglers line the banks of the "stream" running through Stockholm's picturesque Old Town, in reality a body of fresh water called the Strommen which separates the Malaren lake on one side of the city from the Baltic Sea on the other side. For most Europeans, it is hard to imagine schools of Atlantic salmon and sea trout swimming through the heart of a European capital. Marine biologists say that salmon and trout require almost pristine conditions to survive. Their presence in Stockholm -- in encouraging numbers -- is a clear sign that the city's water is clean and the aquatic habitats beneath the surface healthy. "It is a point of pride for Stockholmers that their water is clean enough for Atlantic salmon," says Lennart Nyman, a conservation officer with the Swedish branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature. "It shows that the quality of the water is very good." POLLUTION EFFORTS INTRODUCED IN THE 50s An effort to clean the city's waters was launched in the 1950s when industrial and sewage controls were introduced to cut polllution levels. Residents and tourists alike are allowed to fish free of charge and without permits in Stockholm, making it about the only free activity in this Nordic capital where even "happy hour" prices in bars can quickly empty a wallet. Feeless fishing is part of a tradition that goes back to 1436, when the City Council granted wealthy burghers the right to fish the Crown waters in and around the city. These rights were given royal sanction in 1636 by Queen Christina and successive monarchs. In 1860, the privilege of angling in Crown waters was extended to all of Stockholm's inhabitants, including visitors. Salmon and sea trout, however, were not caught in the city's waters until the 1970s. "Salmon are not native to the Stockholm Strommen," says Nyman. "There is no place for them to spawn and the system is filled with predators." Salmon and sea trout were first introduced in Strommen in 1973, when 500 hatchery-reared two-year-old smolt were released by the city's sports federation. Two years later, the experiment proved a success when some returned from the Baltic Sea. Since then, around 600,000 salmon and sea trout smolt have been released under a programme sponsored by the City Council, the National Board of Fisheries and the State Power Board (Vattenfall). "We release about 25,000 salmon and sea trout smolt each year, and estimate that around 25 percent return," says Kjell Winstrom, a fisheries biologist at Vattenfall. "About 800 sea trout and over 100 salmon were taken in 1996. "They usually come back in two to three years' time and grow quite quickly. They weigh around 100 grammes when they are released and average five kg to 10 kg (11-22 lb) when they come back." FISH of RECORD SIZE Some grow to be enormous. The record salmon taken from Stockholm's waters, just south of the parliament, weighed in at 19.4 kg (42.77 lb). Trophies of that size are tempting bait which lure anglers to the city's Old Town on long, freezing Nordic nights. The salmon introduction scheme in Stockholm is part of a larger national programme which has seen almost two million smolt released in more than 30 Swedish rivers. Around 90 percent of Sweden's salmon population has been domestically reared. But the programme has not been a complete success. "The domestically-hatched salmon all over Sweden have been plagued by M-74 disease, a vitamin deficiency passed by mothers to their young. Newly-hatched smolt with the disease don't begin feeding and die," says Dr Lars Karlssonm, a fisheries biologist with the Swedish Salmon Research Institute. "We have been unable to detect the source of the disease in the food chain." Karlsson said the country's off-shore commercial salmon catch fell in 1995 to 2,892 tonnes from 5,600 tonnes in 1990. Still, the fishing in Stockholm is better than that found in any other European capital. Franco, for one, is hooked. "I come here most nights," he said as he cast his line into the water once more.

MCAT	High sulphur fuel oil prices on Friday were assessed steady to firm in line with crude gains and pockets of chinese enquiries, traders said. High sulphur, 180 centistoke fuel oil was quoted at $121/$123 per tonne on Thursday. Traders said there are still two unsold cargoes of 180-cst fuel oil for late December loading from South Korea. Japan has already sold out all of its December barrels, traders said. Traders said there are pockets of Chinese demand seen. "The Chinese has been buying and some were willing to pay up to $8 per tonne over Singapore spot quotes," a trader said. Most traders expected the market to ease late December when Mideast cargoes will arrive. But traders said prices are not likely to move lower than $119 per tonne despite the the arrival of the Mideast supplies. Traders said the blast at a crude pipeline in India has not affected the fuel oil market.

ECAT	Faced with an escalating war against Tamil Tiger separatist rebels and a slowing economy, the Sri Lankan government has a tough task in balancing its budget for next year, analysts said on Sunday. "The government will have to do a delicate balancing act," said a government economist who declined to be identified. "It will have a difficult time in raising revenue." He said the economic slowdown was a result of intensified fighting the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and a drought which caused severe power cuts earlier this year. Inflation is expected to hit 16 percent at year end, up from 7.7 percent last year, while high interest rates forced up by heavy government borrowing to fund the war are hurting business. "Inflation has now come to stay," said Arjuna Mahendran of Crosby Lanka. "The government probably will try to focus more on job creation." Growth in industrial exports and corporate earnings have slowed while foreign reserves are also falling and the stock market is in the doldrums. Deputy Finance Minister Gamini Lakshman Peiris has said the economy is expected to grow four percent this year and bounce back in 1997 to at least last year's growth of 5.5 percent. Peiris, who will present his budget proposals to parliament in early November, has said he will aim to generate jobs and cut unemployment, which officially stands at 13 percent. "We understand it is a difficult situation," said Panduka Ambanpola, head of research at brokerage Jardine Fleming HNB. "Cost cutting is a difficult proposition," he added. "The main areas of revenue are privatisation, borrowing from state banks and monetisation (printing money)." Economists said the government would be forced to keep capital spending down because of high defence expenditure to fight the rebels demanding independence for minority Tamils in the island's north and east. Defence spending in calendar 1997 at 44 billion rupees ($786 million) will account for 22 percent of overall spending but be lower than this year's 48 billion rupees, most of which was spent on buying arms and equipment. Budget estimates presented to parliament last week put overall spending at 283.3 billion rupees, up from 278 billion in 1996, while revenue is pegged at 185.7 billion rupees, up 17 billion rupees from 1996. The overall budget deficit of 98 billion rupees is expected to be about eight percent of gross domestic product in 1997 compared to nine percent this year. Crosby's Mahendran said the government's privatisation programme was unlikely to generate the hoped-for revenue. "I do not think they can get half of it," he said. "Hopefully, a number of large enterprises should come on stream next year, like Sri Lanka Telecom and (national airline) Airlanka, and those revenues will help cut the deficit." A new goods and services tax, introduced last week to replace the existing business turnover tax, should improve government tax collections, he said. Peiris said in a recent magazine interview that the government did not plan to cut welfare spending of 15 billion rupees a year but instead target it better to help the most vulnerable. The government also planned to increase money supply and make easier credit available for small and medium industries to generate employment, Peiris said.
GCAT	Israel has lodged an official complaint with France for deciding to send Foreign Minister Herve de Charette on only a 24-hour visit to the Jewish state next week, an Israeli official said on Monday. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Ygal Palmor said the French ambassador was summoned last week to the ministry where "we expressed our discontent over changes in the programme for the visit". Palmor said Paris had originally promised "a full state visit of two or three days". On Friday, the French Foreign Ministry said de Charette would visit Israel, Lebanon and Syria from March 4-6. "We don't mind what he does in the region once he is here but instead of dedicating two to three days to Israel on a full-scale visit, he will be here for a 24-hour visit which will include a visit to the Palestinian Authority," Palmor said. "Since there had been a promise (of a longer visit), the minister instructed the ministry to express his discontent," he said, referring to Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy. "We were supposed to discuss bilateral issues and the peace process but it was also supposed to a 'get-acquainted' visit with representatives of Israeli society not only with the prime minister and foreign minister," Palmor told Reuters. Last week, the French Foreign Ministry expressed concern over Israeli plans to build new housing for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem, saying the project would end a "climate of confidence" following Israel's troop redeployment from Hebron. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to build 6,500 Jewish homes at Jabal Abu Ghneim or Har Homa, a hill of pine trees between Jerusalem and Bethlehem captured by Israel in the 1967 war.
GCAT	Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed concern Friday over mounting tension between the two communities on the divided island of Cyprus and called for maximum restraint. In a statement issued through a spokesman he also reminded all sides that the U.N. Charter forbade the threat or use of force and underscored the importance of "carefully prepared face-to-face talks" between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.   The statement was prompted by a recent deal by the Greek Cypriot-led government in Nicosia to acquire Russian-made S-300 ground-to-air missiles, and a warning by Turkey that it would launch an attack if the missiles were deployed. "The secretary-general believes that the events of the past week once again underline the inherent instability of the status quo and add urgency to the concerted efforts to achieve an overall political settlement through negotiations," the statement, read by U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard, said. The secretary-general "underscores the importance of carefully prepared face-to-face talks between the leaders," it continued, referring to Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, as head of the Greek Cypriot community, and Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader. "He calls upon the parties to avoid risk of confrontation on the island and urges all parties to exercise maximum restraint. The secretary-general reminds all sides that the United Nations Charter forbids the threat or use of force in situations such as this," the statement concluded.
MCAT	Singapore fuel oil swaps firmed slightly late afternoon on expectations of further buying interest from a local trader, market sources said. On Monday, the trader bought a late January 20,000-tonne cargo at $124.00 per tonne free-on-board Singapore. The purchase held prices up in the wake of lacklustre demand and the same trader is expected to continue buying for the rest of this week. "The market is supported by some Chinese buying enquiries and the absence of new Middle East exports," one trader said.   January swaps traded in the afternoon at $121.25 per tonne while February traded at $117.25 a tonne, up between 25 and 50 cents from Monday, brokers said. January was last quoted at $121.00/$120.50 per tonne while February was called at $117.25/$118.00. Two majors each sold 150,000 barrels of gas oil each to a Thai and a Kuwaiti trader at $32.50 a barrel for January 14-18 loading on an fob Singapore basis. January gas oil was last quoted at $32.00/$32.10 a barrel, down from Monday's $32.15/$32.25, one broker said.   The softer prices came despite reports of China seeking to buy record volumes in the first quarter, traders said. China is expected to buy about one million tonnes of gas oil for January arrival, up from December's estimated 800,000-tonne purchase. Jet fuel was slightly firmer with the January jet fuel/gas oil spread or regrade was last quoted at $2.30/$2.50 per barrel. Naphtha, lacking direction with Japan on a week-long holiday, was quoted firmer in line with the higher crude values. January was last seen at $24.80/$25.00 a barrel, up about 30 cents from Monday. -- Singapore Newsroom (+65-870 3093)

MCAT	Wall Street's bull run, marked by a sixth consecutive record close overnight, boosted European bourses on Thursday and helped leading German shares to open at a new peak. On the currency markets the dollar was steady against the mark but firmed against the yen after Japan's "Mr Yen", senior finance ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara, welcomed a rising dollar and said Tokyo's foreign exchange policy had not changed. New York's performance gave an early impetus to European equities. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 8.20 points at 6,274.24 after the Federal Reserve decided to keep U.S. interest rates unchanged. The Dow has surged 245 points, or four percent, since the start of the month In Frankfurt German shares extended their rising trend and pre-bourse electronic dealings began at a new record high with the 30-share IBIS DAX index opening at 2,783.76 points and then moving further ahead. The trend continued in floor trading where the DAX-30 also passed a new trading peak. Major share movers were Commerzbank, up over five percent on continuing merger speculation, and Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank also up on higher volumes. After a disappointing performance on Wednesday, prompted by rising interest rate fears, London shares opened higher, pepped up by Wall Street and positive company news. However, they reversed their early 12-point gain and the blue chip FTSE 100 index fell into negative territory after the release of figures showing stronger-than-expected British inflation. Year-on-year inflation in October rose sharply to 2.7 percent from 2.1 percent in September. The market was given some backbone by well-received second quarter results from British Telecom, and first half figures from South West Water and PowerGen. News of Great Universal Stores 1.05 billion pound ($1.7 billion) takeover of Experian, a Californian supplier of credit, marketing and real estate information services, was also welcomed. The Paris bourse also opened higher, lifted by Wall Street, and the spotlight was on insurer Axa and its rival UAP as the two requoted for the first time since announcing their merger on Monday. As expected, UAP soared at the open, rising 17 percent. Axa shares opened 2.21 percent lower. On the foreign exchange front the dollar was seen well supported after U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Jeffrey Shafer said on Wednesday the U.S exchange rate policy had not changed. "Our policy is to have a strong dollar," he said. Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank America, commented: "Shafer's comments were some of the first indications we have seen of what U.S. policy is under the new Clinton administration. To that extent it provided an important boost for the dollar." One focus of interest was the seemingly inexorable rise of the pound sterling, which was given a boost by the higher-than- expected UK inflation figures -- seen as a possible precursor to further British rate rises. The pound had risen sharply on Wednesday after an unexpectedly large decline in UK jobless fuelled expectations of further rate rises. On Thursday it was trading at a fresh four-year high against the dollar of $1.6650. Traders said they saw $1.67 as the next psychological target. CURRENCIES AT 1000 GMT The dollar was at 1.5050 marks and 111.66 yen compared with 1.5041 marks and 111.38 yen late in Europe on Wednesday. STOCK MARKETS AT 1000 GMT The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was down 6.0 at 3,920.9. In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was up 7.05 at 2,224.24. The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was up 10.13 at 2,783.56. PRECIOUS METALS Gold was at $383.30 in early European trade compared with $384.05 an ounce at the London close on Wednesday.

ECAT	France's central government budget deficit was 10 billion francs lower in April than at the same period last year, Budget Minister Alain Lamassoure said on Thursday. An official said this was based on provisional figures, and final data for April had not yet been calculated. Lamassoure, who is also government spokesman, reiterated that he was sticking to his forecasts for this year. France has pledged to reduce its total public deficit to three percent of gross domestic product to meet Maastricht treaty criteria. He said in a televised debate that talk that the deficit may widely overshoot government targets this year was based on a worst case scenario drawn up by the budget ministry. "Every year in Janury the budget department draws up 10 hypothesis on the outlook for the French economy and French finances from the most catastrophic to the best case scenario," he said. "A rather catastrophic hypothesis has been published somewhere. The others have not been published," he said. "What I can tell you are two things. One, the reality of the figures for the end of April, the latest month available, show the government budget 10 billion francs lower than last year," he said. "Therefore I stick to my target. France will qualify for the euro," he said. He also noted that the government's growth forecast for this year of 2.3 percent was judged by independent forecasts as too cautious. -- Paris Newsroom +33 1 4221 5381
MCAT	A firming tone in cash cattle markets kept October CME live cattle futures higher at the close after values in that pit set a new contract high early, traders said. However, back months slipped. Feeder cattle futures rose on lower corn futures, traders said. October and December live cattle posted new contract highs early with October at 72.950 cents a lb and December at 68.800 cents before slipping. Prices finished 0.400 cent higher to 0.200 lower with only October up at 72.725 cents and bull spreading brought on by declining corn futures prices weighing on deferred months. Increased feedlot movement at $71 per cwt sparked further commercial demand in live cattle futures early with fund buying and some buy stops adding to gains before profit taking developed, traders said. Heavyweight choice boxed beef values have risen nearly $4.50 per cwt since the beginning of the month to $105.87 per cwt Wednesday, the highest level since December 1. This has kept packer demand for cash cattle strong and cattle values have recently risen to highest levels since April, 1995.   Feedlots adopted a firm pricing stance this week as their showlists declined due to light placements earlier in the year. "Showlists continue to decline and marketings continue to exceed placements, to a comparable time period" last year, said Dale Benson, Vice President and Senior livstock analyst for Dean Witter. R.J. O'Brien, E.D.& F. Man, Refco, Lind-Waldock and Cargill Investor Services were key buyers, traders said. Rosenthal Collins spread long December/short October and Refco bought February and sold December, sources said. In live cattle options, commercials did risk reversals in December and Febuary and there was some in-the-money October 67 and 68 call buying, pit sources added. Feeder cattle futures were bolstered from the start by a USDA crop report released early Wednesday, which showed greater corn and wheat supplies this year than earlier expected. Rising fed cattle prices also lent support and offset a slight setback in the CME feeder cattle index. The latest CME index was off $0.06 at $63.98 per cwt. Active November particularly firmed by rolling of long positions to Nov from Sep by E.D.& F. Man, pit sources said. Feeder cattle closed 0.175 to 0.450 cent a lb higher with October up 0.450 at 64.325 cents per lb. --Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725
GCAT	A parliamentary deputy from Turkey's main opposition party said on Tuesday that about 50 people were murdered by unknown assailants over the past month in the southeast, where Turkish soldiers and Kurdish rebels are fighting. "In the last month 50 have been killed by persons unknown," Sebgetullah Seydaoglu, a Motherland Party deputy from the southeastern city of Diyarbakir told parliament. He did not reveal the source of his information. Human rights groups accuse the Turkish security forces of being behind scores of "mystery murders", mainly of Kurdish activists in southeast Turkey, where the army is battling a 12-year Kurdish insurgency. The Ankara-based independent Human Rights Association said that around 3,500 people were killed by unknown assailants since the mid-1980s. A technician for Batman Telekom, a southeastern phone company, and his seven-year-old son were found dead -- riddled with machine-gun fire -- at the side of a road in Batman province on Tuesday. More than 21,000 people have been killed in the conflict between Turkish security forces and Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy or independence in the mainly Kurdish southeast.

COFFEE - World market for May 15, 1997 Robusta futures in London closed sharply higher in late Thursday trading, lifting bench mark July to a new one-year high on renewed fund buying. May closed $65 higher at $1,875 per tonne, while July added $63 to close at $1,933 per tonne. The market has become extremely nervous ahead of the Brazilian frost season as inventories in both consuming and producing countries are near 20 year lows. Any sign of cold weather in top-grower Brazil is likely to spur panicky buying. Two severe frosts in 1994, one in late June and another in early July, cut Brazil's 1995/96 crop by some 50 per cent and sent futures prices to near 10-year highs. In New York another rally was sparked by long-term weather outlooks calling for a cool air mass to make its way into Argentina - and possibly sweeping into southern Brazil - next week. Bur forecasters warned that the chance of damaging frost was slim. The probability of climatic problems this year is very minor as statistically they do not repeat themselves very often, Oswald Arana, president of the Brazilian Coffee Exporters Federation and also a coffee producer, said. The key danger months are June, July and August, although a frost has been recorded at the end of May in the last 100 years. Spot May soared 15.55 cents/lb to close at 277.05 cents/lb while July added 14.60 cents/lb to close at 255.20 cents/lb. The outlook remains bullish, although there could be vicious technical corrections the higher the market goes. FUNDAMENTALS UNITED STATES - Supplies of green coffee housed in US warehouses rose in April by 198,000 60-kg bags, to 1.855 million bags, the Green Coffee Association of New York reported. Estimates had ranged from a slight decrease to a 250,000 to 300,000 bag increase. Port of New Orleans posted the largest gain in coffee stocks rising by 201,000 to 752,000 bags, the GCA said. Inventories decreased by 41,000 bags in Laredo, Texas, a major receiving point for Mexican coffee while stocks in San Francisco rose by 18,000 bags to 159,000 bags. Stocks in Houston declined by 37,000 bags to 121,000 bags. UNITED STATES - The CSCE reported certified coffee stocks increased by 1,770 60-kg bags to 37,182 bags as of May 14. There were 18,040 bags of coffee pending grading, the Exchange said. UNITED KINGDOM - LIFFE certified coffee stocks rose to 4,858 5-tonne lots in April from 4,008 lots in March, the Exchange said. For May coffee, members have an option of grading under the new or the old system, which expires at the end of this month. Coffee graded under the old rules will have to be re-graded, which would incur additional costs. BRAZIL - Brazil's 1997/98 coffee crop should reach 24 million 60-kg bags, up from a previous forecast of 23.2 million bags, the Brazilian Coffee Exporters Association (Abecafe) said. Of the total, 19.5 million bags are forecast to be of arabica coffee and 4.5 million bags of robusta against the February figures of 18.7 million and 4.5 million bags respectively. No figure was given for the 1996/97 crop. The Association still expects to see a production deficit of around 4 million bags in 1997/98 despite the higher estimate. Given expectations of the shortfall, Abecafe is calling for a 'transparent and co-ordinated' plan for the sale of government stocks throughout the 1997/98 crop year. BELGIUM - Belgium imported 2.375 million bags of coffee in 1996, 15 per cent more than was imported the previous year. Main suppliers of green coffee in 1996 were Ivory Coast (106,100 vs 62,200 bags), Uganda (185,300 vs 41,700 bags), Brazil (293,500 vs 231,800 bags) and Colombia (165,900 vs 73,400 bags). The country exported 1.561 million bags of coffee in 1996, 30 per cent more than the 1.204 million bags exported the previous year.
ECAT	Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin said Saturday the rescheduling of Russia's commercial debt with foreign creditors should be completed by the end of the year. "I hope we will finish this rescheduling before the end of the year," he told reporters after talks with Group of Seven (G7) finance ministers. Dubinin described the talks as "almost routine" but very important for Russia. Commenting on the health of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Dubinin said there had been no crisis for the economy, adding that intervention in the currency market in August had been less than $1.0 billion.   First Deputy Prime Minister Valdimir Potanin told reporters no difficult questions had arisen. "The discussion was of a more general character," he said. "They asked a lot of questions about restructuring reforms in our economy, about targets of economic and financial policy for next year and about the budget for next year. It was very positive," he added.   Asked if the health of President Boris Yeltsin, who is awaiting heart surgery had been discussed, Potanin said, "Since the problem has been made public and been discussed openly, it has lost its acuteness and the situation is quite calm." The IMF loan, agreed earlier this year, is subject to strict monthoy monitoring. A tranche of about $330 million was delayed in July over concern over the level of tax revenues. The IMF and Moscow agreed new slightly easier performance targets and the tranche was paid but economist say Russia's ability to collect the necessary revenue will remain a key concern. The 1997 draft budget foresees a deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP and economists says Russia's ability to collect the necessary revenue will remain a key concern.
GCAT	Serbia's opposition leaders warned their supporters on Saturday that ruling Socialists were preparing to enlist the help of hardline nationalists in an attempt to undermine nearly 70 days of street demonstrations. Vuk Draskovic, one of the leaders of the opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition, told a rally in Belgrade that President Slobodan Milosevic "has decided to replay his patriotic song" that helped ignite four years of war in the Balkans. "Unless we stop him, he'll 'unify' Serbia in the way he 'unified' Yugoslavia," Draskovic told a small crowd in the city centre. Draskovic's comments coincided with reports that Milosevic's ruling Socialists had turned to the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party to help shore up its damaged position. Milosevic, widely blamed for plunging former Yugoslavia into war in 1991, has accused the Zajedno coalition of plotting to destabilise Serbia in daily street protests. Zajedno, joined by university students, has vowed to keep up its campaign until authorities recognise opposition victories in Belgrade and elsewhere in November municipal elections. Saturday's rally drew several thousand people to Republic Square, a smaller turnout than previous protests. Many supporters were joining neighbourhood "promenades" which Zajedno organised after increasingly tough police action had prevented mass street marches that blocked traffic. Opposition followers were concerned over a rising number of reports of police beatings. Riot police on Thursday clubbed protesters seated on a highway into the central town of Kragujevac, beating one member of parliament unconscious. Independent radio stations B-92 and Index reported beatings in several Belgrade districts as police ambushed small groups of people making their way to a student rally on Friday. University students braved winter temperatures on Saturday to keep up a round-the-clock vigil on Kolaceva street in front of a police cordon. The stand-off began last Sunday when police blocked attempts to hold a march through the city centre. University students have organised a 24-hour vigil in a bid to outlast the police cordon, rotating groups of students in shifts. A group of journalists from the state-run Politika newspaper, considered a government mouthpiece, lent support to the students on Saturday, delivering a cake to the protesters. Milosevic's Socialists discussed the unprecedented threat to five decades of unbroken communist and socialist rule at a session of the party's central committee on Friday. Belgrade independent media reported party officials were ready to invite hardline nationalists to join the government to help them portray the opposition as traitors. The independent daily "Nasa Borba", citing unnamed sources, said the party was planning a government reshuffle and a renewed media assault on the Zajedno opposition. The Zajedno protests that have swept Belgrade and cities across the country represented an "attack on the state by the same people who broke the old Yugoslavia", the paper quoted Milosevic as saying at the session. The former communist party chief has relied on his vast police force and his state television station to try to stifle the wave of street demonstrations. The protests -- marked by an irreverent, carnival atmosphere -- have won strong Western support and sparked divisions within the Socialist ranks. The republic of Montenegro, which together with Serbia comprises what is left of Yugoslavia, has also sharply criticised Milosevic's handling of the crisis. Milosevic has remained aloof and out of public view during the crisis while his deputies have sent out mixed signals, shifting from promises of concessions to stern warnings and communist-style rhetoric.
MCAT	Mexico's central bank said Monday it placed all $200 million in dollar put options that it offered in its September auction.

MCAT	The Dutch share market outperformed most European rivals on Tuesday, ending over three percent firmer as the dollar pushed higher and Wall Street started strongly, dealers said. The AEX index of leading shares closed up 29.28 points, or 3.14 percent, at 960.62 points. The buying, said traders, came mainly from private investors. Overall volume was fairly low. "Again we've seen private investors in the market itself and in options. Professionals have mainly just fine tuned their portfolios," one trader said.   Financials performed particularly well after relative underperformance. ABN Amro rose 3.40 guilders to 48.30. Aegon was up 5.30 guilders to 155.00. "Over the last seven or eight days, they have not been among the top performers and the bond market is up a fair bit today," one trader said. Semiconductor equipment maker ASM Lithography and of software producer Baan also rose sharply ahead of first half results due out on Wednesday -- ASM Litho by 9.90 guilders to 161.80 and Baan by 5.50 guilders to 156.50. Specific company news on Tuesday was limited to two stocks.   Chemicals group DSM announced it would buy the polyolefin activities of Veba Oel unit Vestolen. The acquisition and expansion plans will cost DSM a billion guilders spread over several years. The shares gained 4.90 guilders to 229.40. PolyGram first half profits, of 270 million guilders, were at the lower end of the forecast range and were two million guilders lower than for the same period in 1996. Its shares rose sharply after the news but dropped back soon after and, by the close, were up a modest 90 cents to 101.90 guilders. "It was trading at that level when the figures came out and the index is now some 10 points higher," one trader said. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
MCAT	The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday ordered the Chicago Board of Trade to submit a plan to resolve the shortage of grain storage capacity. In an unprecedented move, the CFTC ordered the CBOT to raise the capacity and number of locations for grain delivery required to meet corn and soybean futures contracts.   The CFTC in an open meeting warned that if the CBOT does not comply with its order within 75 days, the agency will formulate its own solution to the problem. The CFTC's action is intended to prevent any chance for market manipulation. "We are giving the exchange one more opportunity to align its delivery terms with the realities of the cash market," said CFTC Commissioner Joseph Dial.   "If the current environment of political gridlock at the CBOT precludes the exchange from coming to closure on this matter, then the CFTC will have no other alternative but to do it for them," Dial said. In October, CBOT members rejected a proposal to raise the number of locations available for grain delivery. That plan would have permitted corn, wheat and soybeans to be delivered against futures contracts in Chicago, Toledo, Milwaukee and at points along the Illinois River, and eliminate St. Louis as a delivery location.
GCAT	Afghanistan's Taleban government said on Thursday its former foreign minister Mullah Mohammad Ghous had escaped from captivity by northern opposition forces. Taleban-controlled Kabul radio said Ghous and an unspecified number of colleagues had arrived in the Taleban-held northern province of Kunduz with "the cooperation of the people of (neighbouring) Balkh province". "With great joy we received the report that Mullah Mohammad Ghous...arrived in Kunduz province today safe and sound," said the broadcast monitored in the Pakistani capital Islamabad. Opposition sources had said Ghous was detained with several other Taleban officials when the forces commanded by northern opposition leader General Abdul Malik drove Taleban forces out of Balkh province capital Mazar-i-Sharif only a few days after they had captured the town with his support. But the Kabul radio broadcast on Thursday said Ghous and his colleagues were taken to a safe place by people of Mazar-i-Sharif. "And today, with the direct help and cooperation of the people of Mazar-i-Sharif, he arrived in Kunduz and joined the Taleban there," it said. It said Ghous met Taleban's Information and Culture Minister Mullah Amir Khan Mutaqi after arrival in Kunduz. The Taleban had set the release of its officials and hundreds of its captured fighters as a precondition for peace talks with opposition forces. Other Taleban officials earlier reported detained by opposition forces included then central bank governor Mullah Ahsanullah and Herat province governor Mullah Abdul Razzaq. It was not immediately known whether Ahsanullah, who has also been replaced as bank chief, and Razzaq were among those who arrived with Ghous in Kunduz. A Pakistan-based Afghan news service, Afghan Islamic Press, said Ghous had escaped with six companions. General Malik had turned on Taleban in Mazar-i-Sharif only eight days after striking an alliance with the purist Islamic militia amid a mutiny he staged against then opposition leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum, who later fled to Turkey.
ECAT	The Philippines' US$1.25 billion Yankee bond could be launched sooner rather than later, according to Philippines' president Fidel Ramos. "It was cancelled because of very poor U.S. market conditions at the time," Ramos told reporters at a news conference in Hong Kong. "Now we resume the roadshow for the Yankee bonds upon the recommendation of the governor of the central bank of the Philippines and I think he has already applied for travel authority to go back to the U.S. so that he can kick it off," Ramos said. The bond is intended as a benchmark issue for the Philippines, which is working hard to build its capital markets and finance an aggressive programme of infrastructure development. But its planned launch in early April was delayed when interest rate action in the United States caused some short-term market instability. Central bank governor Gabriel Singson said earlier on Thursday that he had "the luxury of time" in deciding the launch date, and that he was watching markets closely day by day. The U.S. long bond yield was at about 6.50 percent for a spread of about 160 basis points at the original launch date, he said, but exactly similar conditions were not necessary to justify a new launch date. The Securities and Exchange Commission registration is valid for nine months, and everything is in place to allow the central bank to move swiftly as soon as markets conditions warrant, Singson said. -- Sarah Davison (852) 2843 6470
CCAT	Spanish electricity company Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico did not sign a new electricity protocol on Wednesday because it was not satisfied with provisions for sunk costs, Industry Minister Josep Pique said. Shortly before the government and major electricity companies signed the new framework aimed at making the sector more competitive, Cantabrico announced it was pulling out.   "The Industry Ministry considers the approach (of Cantabrico) unacceptable...and has decided to sign the protocol without this company," Pique said at a news conference after the signing. The protocol recognised about two trillion pesetas of sunk costs -- fixed costs in plant and generation which in general will no longer be compensated by the state under the new more competitive regime. Electricity companies will be allowed to pass on these costs via tariffs over the next 10 years. The protocol divided up about 75 percent of the costs among companies. The allocation of the remaining 25 percent will be determined by work groups to be set up to study the issue. Pique said the company had demanded a renegotiation of the terms for distributing the latter 25 percent. Cantabrico said in a statement aspects of the protocol were too vague and could cause damage to the company's assets in the future. -- Madrid Newsroom +341-585-2160
GCAT	Peruvian Prime Minister Alberto Pandolfi said on Monday he expected the siege at the Japanese ambassador's residence to end with the 83 remaining hostages released unharmed by their Marxist captors. "We are sure that the continuing sound handling of the situation will allow a solution that protects the physical well-being and lives of all of the hostages," the head of the government's cabinet said in a speech. "The government is working permanently with prudence and dedication for the prompt release" of the hostages, he added, without giving more details. There has been no word for nine days from President Alberto Fujimori, whose only public reaction to the seizure of the residence came in a blunt, two-minute speech in which he pledged not to use force if the hostage takers laid down arms. Sources close to Fujimori said on Monday that the president, who has the final say on important matters, had held frequent meetings with the government's security adviser, Valdimiro Montesinos, since the Dec. 17 raid on the residence. A shadowy and controversial figure, Montesinos has played a key role in cracking down on Peru's left-wing guerrillas since Fujimori won elections in 1990. The prime minister's confident statement on ending the crisis reflected a new mood of hope since the first face-to-face meeting on Saturday between the guerrillas in the residence and government negotiator Domingo Palermo, who was picked for the job by Fujimori. The meeting between Palermo, who is minister of education in Fujimori's cabinet, and rebel chief Nestor Cerpa Cartolini resulted in the release of 20 more hostages. By Monday afternoon, there had been no further initiatives from the roughly 20 rebels. Heavily armed with grenades and automatic rifles, they have booby-trapped and mined the residence in Lima's fashionable San Isidro district. But in a move some diplomats saw as an attempt by the guerrillas to portray themselves as respectable negotiating partners, the international spokesman of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) condemned a "solidarity" bomb attack on the Peruvian embassy in Athens. A group identifying itself as the Guerrilla Fighting Group claimed credit for the attack, in which one woman was injured. "We reject this sort of display of solidarity because it does not contribute to the solution of a crisis," MRTA spokesman Isaac Velazco told Reuters in a telephone interview from Hamburg, Germany. "We do not justify violence for the sake of violence," he said. "Solidarity has to be expressed within the negotiating process." Earlier on Monday, hostages trapped at the besieged ambassador's home sent letters to families -- the first correspondence allowed out in four days. Relatives of the captives, suffering their 13th day under rebel guns, went to Red Cross headquarters in Lima to pick up scores of messages scrawled on special forms provided by the organisation. Red Cross officials also took food and supplies to the residence. The family of Jesuit priest Juan Julio Wicht, who is among the captives, released a letter he wrote over Christmas. The priest jovially boasted that he was unbeaten at chess after eight games with Japanese and Peruvian diplomats. "I am well and I am doing a lot of good for everyone here in such difficult circumstances," wrote Wicht, who opted to stay in the residence despite being offered freedom. He has celebrated various Masses for the captives. "I am here on a mission and I feel your support and prayers ... I am simply doing what any of you or any Jesuit would do, but better than I." He said tensions were rising and nights spent on the floor of the house were long and hot. But "we hostages maintain our unity and spirits, we pray together and we sing although we do not have the words ... God is helping us." The remaining hostages include Fujimori's brother Pedro, top Peruvian police and government officials and about 20 Japanese businessmen. As the New Year approached, police and civil leaders called on Peruvians to tone down celebrations in sympathy with the hostages, and to refrain from using fireworks -- particularly around the residence -- so as not to alarm the rebels. Despite the hopes for a peaceful resolution to the crisis, Peruvian anti-terrorism police sources said crack troops had completed their preparations for a possible assault on the residence if needed as a last resort.
ECAT	French welfare debt repayment fund CADES said on Friday it will offer between 8 billlion and 10 billion francs of its 2002, 2005 and 2007 bonds at auction next Wednesday.   The amount was broadly in line with expectations. Market sources had said earlier on Friday they expected the broad range to be from eight billion to 12 billion francs. The statement did not give any indication of how much of each bond CADES hoped to sell although the fund has set a minimum sale of one billion francs for each line. Some analysts said the 2002 and 2005 bonds would attract most interest, although one said the 2007 bond has been popular among domestic investors recently.   There are currently 14 billion francs of the 5.5 percent 2002 bond, 12 billion francs of the 6.00 percent 2005 and 11 billion francs of the 6.25 percent 2007 bond outstanding. All bonds were initially issued with a yield spread of seven basis points over French government bonds. Most primary dealers were quoting the 2002 and the 2007 bonds at a spread below seven on Friday. -- Paris Newsroom +331 4221 5542
CCAT	The stock of Italy's money-losing Olivetti was suspended on the Milan bourse Thursday just as it rebounded after the appointment of new Chief Executive Roberto Colaninno. The appointment late Wednesday of Colaninno, a close ally of former Chairman Carlo De Benedetti, punctuates two weeks of crisis at the information technology group, which has seen its finances come under market scrutiny and its stock plunge to record lows. Traders warned that the sharp rise in the share price Thursday was more a reflection of short-term speculation on the volatile stock than a vote of confidence in the new chief executive. "There's no point in rushing to buy now. The situation still isn't clear and the new man is considered a De Benedetti clone," said a broker in Milan. "We have no new information to suggest it's a turnaround situation just yet and the way the stock has been moving recently, it's more like going to a casino." The stock fell to a record low of 465 lire at the start of the week and has repeatedly hit automatic suspension tripwires since. It first sank to the bottom of a 10 percent trading limit and then ran up against the ceiling on Thursday before the bourse officially opened for trade. The shares closed Wednesday at 510 lire ahead of the emergency board meeting in which the chief executive of three months, Francesco Caio, was ousted and replaced by Colaninno, head of auto components group Sogefi. Colaninno's appointment was the latest twist in events since De Benedetti resigned from the Olivetti board on Sept. 3 after 18 years as chairman, apparently losing a power battle with Caio. But De Benedetti, who remains Olivetti's largest shareholder with a 15 percent stake, is reported to have been the prime mover behind the ousting of Caio, his former assistant who masterminded the launch last year of Olivetti's 41.3 percent owned Omnitel mobile phone venture. Analysts speculate Colaninno may be a stop-gap figure who will run Olivetti while it hunts for a prominent figure in the telecommunications industry to push it forward in the phone sector, widely viewed as its best hope for future survival. Colaninno is widely seen as enjoying the confidence of De Benedetti, and the former chairman's industrial holding company CIR also controls Sogefi, founded by Colaninno in 1981. But analysts and traders were wary about hailing Caio's departure and Colaninno's arrival as a turnaround, warning that problems highlighted in the last two weeks have not gone away. The company side-stepped key questions about its business put by market regulators by issuing a statement early Wednesday giving details of some of its affairs but leaving out others. Caio, current chairman Antonio Tesone and De Benedetti are being investigated by magistrates in Olivetti's home town of Ivrea in northwest Italy who suspect the company may have issued misleading statements about its financial position, judicial sources say.
CCAT	Shares in Bre-X Minerals Ltd dropped and shares in Barrick Gold Corp rose after Barrick said on Monday the two companies had submitted a joint proposal to operate the massive Busang gold project in Indonesia. Bre-X was down C$1 to C$20 in heavy trading of 2.2 million shares by mid-morning. Barrick rose C$0.65 to C$39.45. But the announcement did not dissipate the investor uncertainty that has shadowed Bre-X for months, analysts said. "There are no details," said gold analyst John Ing with Maison Placements Canada Inc.   "There are all different kinds of rumors as to how much (Barrick will pay) but I don't think we'll know anything until the Indonesian government responds," Ing said. Barrick said the two companies had formed a proposal along lines suggested by the Indonesian government last month. But the proposal still requires government blessing, Barrick said. While Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said the two companies "have come to mutually acceptable terms" after negotiations this weekend, a matching statement from Bre-X was conspicuously missing, analysts said. Bre-X was expected to make a statement this afternoon.   The Calgary-based company did not return calls. "It's quite possible that they may not have a deal," said Ing. The announcement from Barrick "almost looks like a trial balloon," he said. Negotiations between Bre-X and Barrick to split up Busang have been plagued by twists and turns. While the Indonesian government has clearly favored Barrick to act as Bre-X's partner, Bre-X has made no secret that it wants an open bidding process for its stake in Busang. And many Bre-X shareholders have said they fear negotiations with Barrick will not be fair since the talks were virtually mandated by the Indosian government. Some of them have threatened legal action if the deal is unfair. "Barrick has an established track record of being fair," responded Borg, who said this deal would not be any different. Meanwhile, Indonesian officials have put pressure on Barrick and Bre-X to sort things out quickly. The government extended a November 22 deadline to December 4, and then extended it again to the end of December. ((Heather Scoffield, Reuters Toronto Bureau 416 941-8104))
MCAT	A strong bullish trend on the Budapest Stock Exchange continued on Thursday as foreigners remained active and recent strong gains also attracted domestic institutional and small investors' interest, traders said. The BUX index soared to the 14th daily record high in a row, closing at 4,724.59, up 161.76 points or 3.55 percent. "There is a euphoria on the bourse," said Kalman Schuszter of New York Broker. Traders said that the bull-run was driven by a rising trend on the world's bourses, good macroeconomic figures, underpinned by November current account data released on Wednesday, and improving corporate performances. Schuszter said that these factors firmed foreign investors' confidence in the market, and U.S. investment funds also increased their activity as Moody's granted investment grade to Hungary late last year. Traders added that the bourse must seem a more attractive opportunity for taking profits for Hungarian small investors than ever. "Even taxi-drivers say it is worth buying shares," said Peter Haas of Postabank Securities. "We have an incredible number of orders," Schuszter said. "These are typical average people. I have never seen a swarming like that." However, traders added that prices began to turn downwards at the end of the session, and larger number of the shares closed lower than it was usual recently, which may have been signs of a coming correction. But the Hungarian bourse remained optimistic for the longer-term as traders believed corporate results to be published from the end of the month would be positive. "1997 will be the year of rising certainly," Schuszter said.
MCAT	Italian bond prices are taking a hammering as investors are seized by doubts over Italy's chances of restoring its state finances to health in time to secure a place in a European currency union planned for 1999. "What we are seeing is a much more rational assessment of Italy's chances of taking part (in monetary union)," said Ken Wattret, an economist at Banque Paribas' London office. A key barometer of international investor confidence in Italy's improving financial well-being -- the "spread" between 10-year BTPs and German Bunds -- is predicting stormy weather ahead. The spread, which measures the risk premium investors are willing to pay for holding Italian treasury paper rather than its German equivalent, has widened sharply in recent weeks and ballooned out to 208 basis points on Monday. The June contract on London's LIFFE market sagged by 130 basis points on Monday and was quoted at 124.35 in late trading. Market commentators say that behind the sagging confidence in Italy's financial well-being are nagging doubts over the government's ability to keep in motion a virtuous circle of falling interest rates and improving state finances. The government has placed joining a European economic and monetary union (EMU) on its 1999 launch date at the centre of its strategy to slash a huge public sector deficit. As confidence grew in Italy's determination to meet tough qualifying criteria for EMU membership, interest rates would start to tumble along with the costs of servicing Italy's huge national debt, the government hoped. Investors for a time bet that Italy would achieve a "convergence" with its more prosperous northern neighbours -- notably France and Germany. Italian bond prices soared and the all-important spread narrowed to 138 basis points in January. "The Italian convergence rally was based on optimism over Italy making it in the first wave of EMU (European and economic monetary union)," said David Brown, chief economist at Bear Stearns International. "The EMU optimism was overbought and if it unwinds you could get a real blowing out of the BTP/Bund spreads," said Brown. The spread is now widely expected to widen to 250 basis points in the coming weeks. "The scope for divergence is now greater than for divergence, said Alex Garrard, economist at London-based UBS. "We are now advising investors to get out of the market if it goes below 200," he added. Investors have been unsettled by the difficulties Prime Minister Romano Prodi has been having in forging a consensus behind a supplementary budget which he must get through to keep Italy's quest for EMU membership on track. Doubts have also been fuelled by signs that Italy is running out of time if it wants to take interest rates lower and thereby force down the cost of its heavy debt-servicing burden. "In the United States there is a big possibility of interest rate rises and this will not help bonds," said a London-based economist with a major international investment bank who asked not to be named. "When the big bond markets decline the peripheral ones will fall even further," he added. Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio held back from cutting interest rates last year until he was convinced that inflationary expectations had been squeezed out of the economy. The central bank last cut the discount rate to 6.75 percent from 7.50 percent on January 22. As the German economy picks up, the signs are that the Bundesbank may have to tighten monetary policy in the coming months. "The Bundesbank is moving from a neutral-to-down bias to to a neutral-to-up bias," said Francesco Giordano, economist at CSFB in London. "This is bad for Italy which is behind in the interest rate cycle and it could find it hard to cut rates," he added.
MCAT	Turkey's state-owned oil company Tupras has accepted offers of Iranian, Syrian and Kazakh crude for its 300,000 tonne sour crude tender, traders said on Tuesday. Official confirmation was not available but traders believed Tupras took 130,000 tonnes of Iranian Heavy and 70,000 tonnes of Syrian Light from a Swiss trader, 60,000 tonnes of Iranian Heavy from a British major and 60,000 tonnes of Tengiz crude from a major U.S. equity holder. The Iranian heavy was heard priced at $1.50 below Dated Brent, while the Syrian was believed accepted at 20 cents a barrel over the official selling price and no numbers were reported for the Tengiz barrels. The tender, which closed last Friday, was for delivery in the July 15-25 window. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 8060

MCAT	The Athens bourse closed slightly higher on Friday with market watchers expecting stabilisation and active block trading to continue by end-96. "We see a market stabilisation. However, we expect a possible small decline in the share index, in the beginning of January. The public appers to be cautious," said Marietta Petropoulaki of ATE AEDAK. She added that she expects the stabilisation trend to continue in the first three months of 1997. "I expect January to be a month of moderate performance and the first signs of improvement to appear around March," said Petropoulaki. George Chrisochoidis, managing director of N. Chrisochoidis Securities, said he expected the stabilisation trend to continue. "The financial results of banks and several big Greek companies have been very impressive. Their dividend yields are expected to be high and their stocks quite attractive," Chrisochoidis said. As soon as the investment public regains confidence in the stock exchange, after audits on the Delta Securities scandal are completed, people will start reinvesting in stocks especially at current prices, he added. The Athens general share index closed up 0.14 percent or 1.34 points at 934.46 from Tuesday's 933.12. It opened at 932.85. Trading volume fell to 11.5 billion drachmas on volume of 5.3 million shares in active block trading. Block trades of Intertech, Alpha Leasing, National Investment Bank, Teletypos and National Bank took place. Losers led gainers 101 to 81 with 36 issues unchanged on 218 traded. Banks gained 0.89 percent, construction lost 0.25 percent while small caps declined 1.07 percent and investment shares dropped by 0.29 percent. The Merrill Lynch call spread warrant on OTE with a strike price of 3,800 drachmas was quoted at the same price at 569.00-587.00. Shares of OTE telecom the underlying, lost 20 drachmas at 4,205. The recently launched ING Baring Financial Products American style call warrant based on a basket of six bank stocks was quoted at $8.33-$9.33. The strike price is set at $99.60 and the warrants expire October 8, 1997. The Morgan Stanley Hellenic Blue Chip Warrant, which has a strike price of 100 marks, was quoted at 3,341-3,543 drachmas. --Margarita Sotiropoulou, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
ECAT	Guatemala's trade deficit for the first three quarters of 1996 was $726 million, down 23 percent from the same period last year, Central Bank President Willy Zapata said Thursday. The deficit for the same period in 1995 was $944 million, Zapata told a news conference. Zapata said a 32 percent increase in the value of non-traditional exports so far this year is largely responsible for an increase in export income and the lower deficit. The value of cloth and thread exports during the first three quarters of this year increased by 64 percent over the same period in 1995. Cotton and cotton derivatives showed an increase of 176 percent. Honey and minerals both showed increases of over 200 percent. The total value of exports rose only 2.3 percent, to $1.58 billion, in the first nine months of 1996 from $1.54 billion in the same period this year. Zapata blamed international prices for the decreased value of most of Guatemala's traditional exports such as sugar, coffee and meat. Comparing the first three quarters of 1995 and 1996, export volumes have not decreased for bananas, coffee, sugar or petroleum. The value of coffee exports was off 17.3 percent despite a 23.6 percent increase in volume exported through September 1996, he said. A slowdown in Guatemala's economic growth has slowed imports, which also affected the trade balance, Zapata said. In the first nine months of the year, total imports were $2.31 billion compared to $2.49 billion in the same period in 1995. While imports of combustibles and construction materials increased, there was an 11.3 percent drop in imports of consumer goods and a 9.7 percent drop in imports of raw materials for industry and agriculture. --Fiona Ortiz, Guatemala City bureau, +502 251-5718
MCAT	Canadian government bonds were the top performing market in the week ended February 13 while a shaky Italian market registered the worst losses, according to Salomon Brothers data on Friday. Canadian bonds notched up a 1.20 percent return in the week and were up 0.81 percent in U.S. dollar terms at a time when the U.S. currency made advances against most major currencies. Canadian dealers said the domestic bond market was encouraged by strength in U.S. Treasuries but outperformed their neighbours who were swamped with supply. There was also some optimism ahead of a federal Canadian budget next week. Swiss bonds came in second with a 1.13 percent return in Swiss francs, while third-placed British gilts returned 0.99 percent in sterling. Italian BTPs were the only market in the main Salomons government bond index to show a loss in local currency terms, with investors losing 0.10 percent in the week. In dollar terms, Italian debt showed a 2.24 percent loss. Concerns about Italy's fiscal situation and residual worries about its progress towards European monetary union weighed on Italian debt, analysts said. The overall Salomon index was up 0.56 percent in local currencies and down 0.43 in dollar terms. After Canada's robust performance, the only other markets to make gains for dollar-based investors were U.S. Treasuries with a 0.69 percent return, Britain with 0.39 percent and Sweden with 0.31 percent. Except for Italy, most European bond markets turned in decent performances. Dutch debt returned 0.84 percent in the local currency, France and Denmark made 0.76 percent gains, Sweden made 0.73 percent, Belgium 0.71 percent, Spain 0.59 percent and German Bunds 0.58. Japanese government bonds turned in a relatively weak performance, showing a modest 0.11 percent return in yen and a 0.79 percent loss in dollar terms. Salomon's bond index is calculated using all government bonds with over one year to maturity, weighted for market capitalisation. Only bonds freely available to institutional investors and with a certain minimum amount outstanding are included. Returns take account of price moves and accrued interest. --Adam Cox, International bonds unit +44 171 542 6784
GCAT	Britain expressed grave concern on Thursday at the upsurge of violence on the West Bank and Gaza Strip and urged Israeli and Palestinian leaders to show "statesmanship" to halt the fighting. The Foreign Office said fighting, in which 33 Palestinians and 10 Israelis have died, had left the Middle East peace process in a precarious state. "Actions such as the opening of the tunnel along the Western Wall and the recent demolition of a Palestinian community centre in Jerusalem have cause suspicion and disquiet," the Foreign Office said in a statement. "We call on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to exercise the statesmanship required and to step back from confrontation and return to the past of trust and reconciliation." Reflecting the acute anxiety in Britain, Prime Minister John Major sent messages to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat urging restraint. His office said he also telephoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and sent a message to Jordan's King Hussein. A Foreign Office spokesman referred to Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind's comments on Wednesday in which he expressed concern about the impact of the violence on the Middle East peace process. "It is very worrying, very disturbing," Rifkind told CNN. "It is going to be very, very important to give the reassurance and to give the signs of tangible progress that can reduce the temperature and get matters under an even keel." Rifkind said it was important that Netanyahu had met Arafat, establishing a personal relationship. But he said there was a need for progress in three crucial areas: -- opening up Palestinian areas sealed off by Israel with "very disturbing" economic consequences. -- redeployment of Israeli troops from the West Bank town of Hebron, as foreseen in interim peace agreements signed by the previous Israeli government. -- a resumption of Israeli-Syrian peace talks, crucial to a comprehensive settlement in the region. Rifkind said Britain had recognised a need for a "period of quiet reflection" for Netanyahu, who took office in June, to establish his government's position on a range of issues. But he added: "Now you can't have that going on indefinitely. There is a momentum to the peace process and I think there is now a renewed sense of urgency that Mr Netanyahu's government must spell out the Israeli position and actually enter into the negotiations in a constructive way. "I think that is what they want to do but I am not yet persuaded that they have clarified even in their own minds exactly what their strategic objectives might be."

ECAT	Greece expects GDP growth of 3.3 percent in 1997, well above the EU average and compared to 2.6 percent in 1996, National Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou told reporters. He forecast an average inflation rate of 6.5 percent in 1997, down from 8.5 percent in 1996, and set a year-end 1997 inflation target of 4.5 percent.
ECAT	The most telling aspect of the Fiscal Year 1998 budget, unveiled by the Massachusetts Senate Ways and Means Committee, is not actually part of the Fiscal Year 1998 budget. Rather, it resides in what chairman Sen. Stanley Rosenberg calls a "companion bill," a $293.1 million appropriation package released Thursday with the $18.3 billion spending plan, State House News Service reported. Almost half of the companion bills total is used to pay the final installment on the record $1.2 billion the state borrowed to bail itself of the fiscal crisis that swept fiscal conservative Gov. William F. Weld into office. Half the companion bill pays off the last of that debt. The rest will fund several one-time projects, including new textbooks and library supplies for primary and secondary schools, and new cars for state police. The companion piece is funded by this year's surplus. Without having to put money in the budget for deficit-bond debt service, Rosenberg said, the committee could authorize $82 million in tax cuts -  a development unthinkinkable seven years ago. "It closes that chapter," Rosenberg said, "but it doesn't change our mindset about not repeating the mistakes of the 80s.  We don't make commitments we can't keep." Most of the commitments in the budget, which will be debated in the Senate starting Tuesday, focus on children, senior citizens, and others who need assistance. ((--Boston bureau, 617-367-4106))
GCAT	British Prime Minister John Major has ruled out holding an election on March 20, ITN television said on Thursday. It quoted Conservative party sources as saying he had ruled out the March date. Major said in an earlier interview that a parliamentary by-election, due to take place on February 27, had to take place first before an election could be held. If there was a March election, the by-election would have to be cancelled. "I think people should just sit back and relax and not get overexcited about it for the moment," Major said. The election must be held by May 22 and May 1 is hot favourite.

CCAT	Brazil's National Development Bank (BNDES) published Monday the terms and conditions for the 30-year concession of the Southern Railway, a 4,100 mile (6,600 kms) network which connects Brazil to Argentina and Uruguay. Under the terms published in the Official Gazette (Diario Oficial), the Southern Railway Network concession will be auctioned on December 13 at a base price of 158 million reais ($154 million).   The winning bidder will be required to pay 20 percent of the total amount cash down. The balance will be paid after a two-year grace period in 112 quarterly installments. The Southern Railway runs through some of Brazil's most propserous territory in the states of Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul carrying grains, oil and alcohol. Last year, it transported 13.6 million tonnes of freight. Generally referred to as the "Mercosur Railway", its concession has sparked considerable interest among investors who see huge opportunities in transporting goods between Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, all partners in a free trade pact. According to news reports, interested investors include meat packers Sadia and Perdigao, Argentina's Grupo Pescarmona, and the Noel Group, which recently won the Western Network concession. The Southern Railway concession will be the fifth of six sections of Brazil's railway network to be auctioned under the National Privatization Program. -- Adrian Dickson, Sao Paulo bureau 5511 232 4411

MCAT	Late Tuesday LME trading saw copper and aluminium spring to life, with both markets probing higher in the final minutes of the kerb to end firm. But the late uptick tended to disguise an otherwise drab day's trading, with volumes low-key and interest only patchy. Other metals were slow throughout the session, ttraders said. "Copper was bought late because it was obvious that it was going to be a good chart close. Ally (aluminium) got through resistance and then set off short covering," one floor trader said. The copper market spent most of the session just above $2,500, having recorded advances in early trade after a reasonable stock fall. The late jump took the the market to $2,514 a tonne, up $26. More significantly, the backwardation widened throughout the session, and was around $85, basis cash/threes, by the close, against under $70 on Monday. July onwards is looking tight, some traders said. Aluminium similarly saved its best till the end, with the market making a determined effort to wear down the resistance above $1,610, and last business was at $1,617, up $14 from Monday. Traders said aluminium was boosted by LME warehouse and IPAI producer stock falls today, as well as signs that the contango may have started to contract again. June date pricing takes place next Monday, and the contango could narrow back in to around $15 again soon, from a current $20. Nickel trading slowed during late afternoon, but prices remained steadier up to the kerb end. The market continues to watch for fresh developments at strikebound Inco, Sudbury, where the current stoppage could run into the annual summer holiday shut-downs, some traders said. Prices subsided from above $7,300, but still finished at $7,290, a $40 gain from the previous kerb. Zinc recovered some poise after Monday's correction to last week's run-up to 4-1/2 year highs, although the market is still some way off re-challenging its highs. Last trade was at $1,363, up $7 from yesterday. Tin ran out of upside impetus in mid-afternoon, and settled back under liquidation to close at $5,590, up $10. The market was also affected by a widening in the contango, although upcoming tightness may not be diffused yet. Lead business was featureless from the outset - hence little deviation from overnight levels. Prices closed at $640, against Monday's kerb close of $641. Alloy was quiet, and three months was indicated at $1,470/80 a tonne, little different from Monday. --Martin Hayes, London newsroom 44 171 542 8080
GCAT	Murders of children aged between seven and 16 in Brazil's biggest city Sao Paulo soared to 239 in the first five months of the year, a newspaper said on Saturday. A survey by Sao Paulo police found 91 percent of the victims were involved in the city's booming trade in crack and cocaine, daily Correio Braziliense said. "The number is impressive because in all of 1996, 337 children were murdered," said police inspector Elisabete Ferreira who heads a unit dedicated to crimes against minors. Eighty-five percent of the victims came from shanty-towns and most had dropped out of school. "In the streets they met other adolescents and learned to steal, to take and sell drugs and to join gangs," the police officer said. Of the 239 minors killed so far this year, 38 were girls and the survey found that an increasing number of them had been tortured and sexually abused before being murdered, Ferreira told the newspaper.
CCAT	Popular clothing retailer Gap Inc. posted record fourth quarter profits Thursday in line with Wall Street estimates. Gap earned $171.2 million, or 62 cents a share compared with $154.6 million, or 54 cents a share for the comparable year-ago period. Sales rose 10 percent to $1.67 billion from $1.52 billion. Analysts predicted the retailer would earn 62 cents a share, according to First Call. Gap, which owns Gap, GapKids, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores, said it opened 203 new stores in 1996, and plans to open at least 275 new stores this year. "Our results demonstrate the strength of our balanced portfolio of apparel brands, with Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy all improving their profitability in 1996," said Millard S. Drexler, Gap Inc. president and chief executive officer. Analysts were pleased with the performance. "They are executing their retail business very effectively and they've had some very appealing merchandise that was attractive and sold at regular prices," said Richard Jaffe, analyst at Schroder Wertheim & Co. "A lot of things came together, the Old Navy business performed well and the apparel was absolutely on target." Jaffe said the record earnings may be hard to maintain but Gap could grow earnings in the mid-teens range. Gap's earnings per share have grown at a compound annual rate of 22 percent over the last three years and 21 percent over the last 10 years. Stacey Pak, an analyst at CS First Boston, also expects earnings will slow. "The first half of 1996 was so good ... that it's hard to beat that, it's hard to even meet that," she said. Experts said the company's long term propects are good given Old Navy's strong growth potential in the United States and the possibility of strong international growth for the overall company. For the year, Gap earned $152.9 million, or $1.60 a share, on sales of $5.28 billion. A year earlier it earned $354.0 million, or $1.23 a share, on sales of $4.39 billion. Drexler said the company was committed to boosting shareholder value through share repurchase programmes and growth in the core business. Gap stock fell $1 to $33.25 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts attributed the fall to profit-taking.

CCAT	Papa John's International Inc said Tuesday it has acquired 16 Papa John's restaurants in the Greensboro-Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina from Norcar Inc. The company did not disclose terms, but said the deal is not expected to impact earnings and will be accounted for as a purchase. The company said the group of restaurants is an excellent strategic fit with its base of company-operated restaurants in North Carolina and gives it expansion opportunities in established markets. It said John Schnatter, Papa John's founder and chief executive officer, and Charles Schnatter, Papa John's senior vice president and general counsel, own a majority interest in Norcar. At April 28, there were 1,273 Papa John's restaurants in 39 states and the District of Columbia. The company said the acquisition gives it 353 company-owned and 920 franchises.
GCAT	Doug Peters, Canada's secretary of state for financial institutions, said on Monday that he would not run in the next federal election. "I want to thank my many supporters...for their confidence in me and for their faith in me as their member of Parliament," Peters said in a statement. Peters gave no reason for his decision. The former senior bank economist was a star candidate in the 1993 election that swept the ruling Liberals to power. But as minister responsible for financial institutions, Peters was criticized for his handling of proposed reforms to Canada's Bank Act.   Peter's so-called White Paper on financial reforms was criticized by foreign bankers for still forcing them to operate federally regulated subsidiaries in Canada. Canada's Senate banking committee later said that Peters' paper did not go far enough and it urged the federal government to boost competition by allowing foreign banks to set up branches. Peters' white paper was also pre-empted by federal Finance Minister Paul Martin in last spring's budget when a bid for more insurance powers by Canada's big banks was rejected. The industry had expected the insurance question to be dealt with in the white paper. A federal election is expected this year. ((Reuters Toronto Bureau (416) 941-8100))

ECAT	Brazilian Central Bank Director for International Affairs Gustavo Franco said this year's current account deficit could reach $20 billion, but he shrugged off recent concerns about the deficit. He said $18 billion of the current account deficit would be financed, because of the large proportion of Brazil's imports which are financed nowadays and no longer paid for in cash. "Basically this means that the trade balance no longer is such an important indicator of our external relations as it used to be," Franco said. "The trade balance has to be seen in context and not as one little number that represents the entire complexity of our external trade relations." Franco dismissed the possibility of any changes in monetary policy, saying the government was studying a number of measures to boost exports. -- Simona de Logu, Rio de Janeiro newsroom, 5521 507 4151

The slowdown in M3 money supply growth was linked to the deceleration of total credit expansion which was within the central bank's 5.0-7.0 percent target range, it said.
GCAT	The European Parliament called on Thursday on the rebel groups holding the south of Albania to lay down their arms and urged President Sali Barisha to stick by his promise to grant them an amnesty. The parliament backed the compromise hammered out between Barisha and the 10 opposition parties on March 9, insisting that all sides should seek a "peaceful and democratic" solution to the crisis. The compromise provides for a general amnesty, the surrender of weapons and the creation of a government of national unity to lead the country to elections by June. Parliament's resolution asked the European Union to appoint a special envoy to south east Europe to help prevent crises such as that being witnessed in Albania. It also urged the EU and international financial institutions to help Albania out of its economic quagmire, on condition that Tirana committed itself to improving democracy and ungagging the media. The assembly said the EU should help with investigations into the failed pyramid investment schemes, whose collapse sparked off the crisis. Dutch European Affairs Minister Michel Patijn told parliament on Wednesday the collapse of the schemes had defrauded small investors of savings worth 40 to 60 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Hans van den Broek, the European Commissioner in charge of relations with central and eastern Europe, on Wednesday appealed to the political forces in Albania to stick strictly to the terms of a potential compromise, warning that the country could collapse if they did not. "One thing is clear, if the compromise doesn't stand, doesn't hold up, then things will get much worse in Albania and there will be an uncontrolled rebellion," he said.

ECAT	Income distribution in Brazil improved last year, particularly after the Real anti-inflation plan introduced in July 1994, newspapers said today. Newspapers said a survey published by the National Statistics Institute (IBGE), the first carried out by the institute after the Real Plan, showed the poorest 10 percent of the population accounted for 1.1 percent of the country's total wealth in 1995, up from 0.7 percent in 1993. The Real Plan knocked monthly inflation down to one percent from 50 percent. That means a record since the Cruzado stabilization Plan in 1986, when the poorest accounted for one percent. The monthly average income of Brazilian workers rose 29 percent to 433 reais from 336 reais in 1995, when compared with 1993, papers said. Despite the slight improvement, Brazil continues to be among the countries with the worst distribution of income in the world, newspapers said. -- Fatima Cristina, Sao Paulo newsroom, 55-11-2324411
GCAT	Chief U.N. arms inspector Rolf Ekeus called Wednesday for a firm reaction by the Security Council to what he said was Iraq's repeated blocking of U.N. weapons teams. Speaking to reporters after briefing the council on a recent series of incidents, he said Iraq's actions were "a clear violation" of council resolutions. "If Iraq is allowed now to decide what we should inspect, when we should inspect it, I think the value of the whole mechanism set up after the Gulf war would be put into question," he said, referring to the U.N. special commission (UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction and ensuring they are not replaced. "This a challenge to the whole ceasefire arrangement and a challenge to the United Nations, which was given the task by the (Gulf war) coalition to carry out the ceasefire. So I said that we expect a firm reaction from the Security Council to support the activities of the commission and by the IAEA (the International Atomic Energy Agency)," he added. Council sources said some members were working on a draft resolution dealing with the recent incidents, which included blocking U.N. weapons teams from three sites they wished to search last week. The sources said a strong resolution was likely to be opposed by Russia, China and Egypt, which in the past have been more sympathetic to Iraq. American U.N. envoy Bill Richardson, who is pressing for a tough resolution, told reporters Iraq had been guilty of "a pattern of concealment, of deception, of delays, of destruction of documents." "What we have is a situation where Saddam Hussein's regime refuses to cooperate with the U.N. Security Council and UNSCOM," he said, urging "an appropriately strong response." Though Richardson did not say so, if the council found Iraq had committed a "material breach" of the Gulf war ceasefire, the way would be cleared for the United States, if it wished, to launch air raids or cruise missile strikes against Iraqi targets, as it has done on several previous occasions. But it seemed doubtful that a resolution containing such language would receive unanimous support. Last Friday the council issued a relatively mild statement deploring an earlier series of incidents in which UNSCOM said Iraqi personnel aboard U.N. helicopters, or Iraqi helicopters flying nearby, had endangered the U.N. craft and their crews assisting U.N. ground teams. Ekeus said that when U.N. inspectors visited a university where professors were known to have been involved in a biological weapons program, one of them tried to escape with a batch of papers. He was intercepted and the documents were found to relate to "very sensitive development and production efforts concerning a major biological warfare agent, which was not declared before by Iraq. So we will have to investigate that further." Ekeus, who will leave UNSCOM July 1 and will be succeeded by Australian U.N. envoy Richard Butler, speculated that it "may be because we are changing leadership of the special commission that Iraq is now trying to change the ground rules somewhat." Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, in a recent letter to the Security Council, said access to some sites had recently been denied because of concern that the inspections were not to carry out UNSCOM's mandate but to "detect the arrangements made for the security of Iraq, its leadership and the personnel involved." This concern was heightened "by the fact that many of those who carry out inspection team missions are United States nationals, seconded to work with the special commission." Aziz said the UNSCOM team concerned had been allowed to inspect 40 out of the 43 sites to which it sought access. Denial of access to the other sites "cannot be interpreted as a decision by the government of Iraq to prevent the special commission implementing its mandate, as Mr Ekeus alleges," he added.
GCAT	A search resumed on Sunday for 28 seamen lost in a remote part of the South Atlantic after their ship sank while carrying sugar from Brazil to Iraq. A Hercules C-130 plane was flying to the area for the third day to look for survivors or wreckage from the Jahan, which went down on Friday about 680 miles west of Cape Town. South African airforce spokeswoman Marietta Hopley said hopes were fading that the crew would be found alive, even though weather in the area was fine. "Up till now no radio contact, beacon signals or flares have been received or seen by the Hercules search crew," she said in a statement. The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Australia picked up a distress call on Thursday night saying the freighter was flooding and the crew were abandoning ship. The centre said the Jahan went down five hours later. There was no word on what caused the sinking of the 15,022 deadweight tonne Jahan, built in 1972, registered in Belize and operated by Seatimes Shipping of Singapore. The weather in the region, midway between the South African coast and the remote island of Tristan da Cunha, was reported to be fine at the time. A spokesman for Seatimes in Singapore said the Jahan, owned by Jahan Shipping of Panama, was on charter to a London company and carrying 14,000 tonnes of sugar from Brazil to Iraq.

MCAT	Slovenian shares slipped on Tuesday, continuing to correct after steep rises over the past three weeks, but traders said they were confident the market could resume its upward trend later in the week. "It was mostly domestic investors who were selling today, trying to realise their short-term profits," said Robert Rudolf, a trader at brokerage Moja delnica. The seven-share SBI index fell 15.33 points or 1.21 percent to 1,254.60. Overall, five shares fell, nine rose and one was steady, while another nine were untraded. "Compared to recent big jumps these declines over the past two days are very small," said Milos Pavlic, a trader at brokerage ABH. Turnover fell to 464.3 million tolars from 591.6 million. Bank SKB was the most actively traded share, firming 1.41 percent to 41,580 tolars on volume of 4,477 shares. Construction company GPG was the leading decliner, falling 4.88 percent to 7,800 tolars on volume of 10 shares. Preferred shares of bank Hipotekarna banka Brezice were the biggest gainer, firming 4.21 percent to 3,740 tolars on volume of 135 shares. -- Novica Mihajlovic, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439
GCAT	All 18 supporters of ousted minority party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri, detained here in a clash with the army on Saturday in Indonesia's second city, had been released by early Sunday, a party official said. Sucipto, head of the East Java branch faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) that still backs Megawati, condemned the attack on 500 party members who on Saturday marched on the offices their rival faction in Surabaya, East Java. "Those that came did not bring weapons. They came to protest because up to now the government has been ignoring the aspirations of the mass of PDI members in East Java," Sucipto told a news conference on Sunday afternoon. Party officials said six people were injured when the protest was dispersed by the troops on Saturday afternoon. The PDI split after a government-backed congress in June elected deputy parliamentary speaker Surjadi to head the Christian-Nationalist party, ousting Megawati, the popular daughter of Indonesia's founding president Sukarno. Megawati, who says the congress was illegal, maintains she is the party's rightful leader and she apparently still enjoys widespread support among party members. On July 27, police sparked the worst rioting in more than 20 years in Jakarta after they forcefully evicted Megawati supporters from PDI headquarters, sparking disturbances in which at least five people died. Protests by PDI party members opposing Surjadi's leadership have continued around the country since June with one group of Megawati supporters earlier this month marching on Surjadi's official residence in Jakarta and chaining its front gate. Sucipto denied the protestors had attacked the military and thrown stones at the troops dispatched to protect the offices of the Surjadi faction. "We were only throwing plastic bottles of water," said one. Political analysts say there is concern about stability ahead of next year's general election in May and the possibility of rising protests from disaffected PDI members.
CCAT	First National Bank Holdings Ltd said on Wednesday its sale of Protea Furnishers Ltd's debtors book back to that firm will result in a loss to the bank of around 50 million rand in the second half of the year. "The Profurn book has been sold...with effect from April 1, 1997. Resulting losses are estimated to be in the region of 50 million rand and will be reflected in the second half of the financial year," FNB said in a statement. It was announced last month that Profurn had repurchased its furniture financing business, including the debtors' book and staff, from FNB for about 270 million rand. The transaction sees FNB becoming Profurn's largest shareholder with a 22 percent stake. FNB, battling with hefty bad debts, last year also sold a portion of its FirstPref debt financing unit back to McCarthy Retail Ltd in December last year. The date of the transfer was April 1, 1997. FNB said on Wednesday losses in the FirstPref operation totalled 136.8 million rand. -- Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003

MCAT	London robusta coffee futures continued to drift lower as origins stepped up sales but light manufacturer and trade buying helped slow the descent. Traders said volume remained fairly modest as most major players, exhausted after a prolonged rally, were sidelined or scaling down their commitment. "The big boys are either out or trading on smaller scale," said one. Benchmark May finished $30 down at $1,735 a tonne after ranging between $1,728 and $1,765. Volume totalled 4,608 lots. There was some spread trading in May/Sept which changed hands at $10-$15. During the day, the London market showed little reaction after New York's arabica futures re-tested the 205.50 cents a lb on May, now seen as a major hurdle. "We are waiting on the States really. London sitting here, drifting slightly lower and volume is nothing special while people scratch their head to try to figure out what's going on," said one. New York's May continued its choppy session, trading at between 199 cents and 205.50 and not breaking either way. Technically the New York market remained bullish although it's a bit overdone. "I think the market is getting its breath and if it gets above 205.50 and closes above that, we could see more fund and spec buying coming in." Roaster interest in New York is dying a bit as roasters have either finished their fixings or are awaiting for much lower prices. With only a week left to go before the spot March contract goes off the board, its open interest was still relatively high at 1,131 lots -- or the equivalent of about 300,000 bags of coffee -- against certifiable coffee of 35,083 bags. While London's direction hinges on New York, any new rally in London is likely to be short-lived as fundamentally, robustas are over supplied. Technically, the market is running into layers of heavy resistance in place since the last major bull run in early 1996. But May has to come down to at least $1,650 or $1,600 to confirm the downward reversal. There were no fresh fundamental inputs but traders were keeping an eye on producers' talks due in London on March 22. Indonesia, part of a six-member Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) technical group, said on Wednesday the grouping should consider the interest of consumers following the sharp hike in bean prices. Ivorian Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze reiterated that the grouping would abide by its decision to cut an extra 1.3 million bags of coffee in the first half of 1997. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985
CCAT	Australian transport group Mayne Nickless Ltd said on Thursday that it was confident it would meet its plans for earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the full financial year to June 30.   Mayne earlier reported a net profit of A$43.14 million for the six months to December 31, down from A$50.06 million a year earlier. Earnings before interest and tax slipped 0.7 percent to A$101.4 million. Sales eased 6.3 percent to A$1.38 billion. "Our underlying EBIT has improved year on year, but for the latest half year we've booked higher goodwill charges due to an accounting standard change," managing director Bob Dalziel said. "Whilst reductions in our corporate overheads have been initiated, these have not been implemented as quickly as we expected, and have lagged behind the business divestments and restructuring that have occurred," he said.   "I remain optimistic, however, that overall EBIT plans for the year will be met," Dalziel said. Dalziel said the result was in line with the company's operating plans and reflected the restructuring of its European and Australian contract logistics and Australian time critical express groups which he said would continue through 1997. "Importantly, we are encouraged by the early signs from the restructuring of the Australian time critical express business," he said.   "As a consequence of this work we determined late last year to pursue a "get big" strategy in our selected markets." Dalziel said Mayne believed that significant size in each of the geographic markets in which it operated was fundamental. "Logistics in Europe is highly competitive and we have observed that there is a consolidation of the market taking place," he said. "This is reinforced by our investigation of possible acquisitions in France. In addition, out customers are increasingly looking for pan-European solutions and larger networks," he said.   "In November 1996 management, therefore, decided to explore all options ranging from acquisitions to the identification of a party who is pursuing growth in European logistics," he said. "To date we are encouraged by our assessments that we will be able to profitably participate in the consolidation process." Among the divisions, Health Care of Australia had revenue of A$342 million, up 50 percent on the prior corresponding period.   "The increase was partly attributable to a full half contribution from businesses that were part of Australian Medical Enterprises which the company acquired in October 1995, including St George Private Hospital in Sydney," Mayne said. Earnings before interest and tax totalled A$44 million, up 48 percent from a year earlier. Time critical express reported revenue of A$598 million, down three percent, largely due to the strength of the Australian dollar, Mayne said. EBIT fell 15 percent to A$24.66 million. Contract logistics reported revenue of A$444 million, down one percent, also due the dollar's strength, it said.   EBIT was flat at A$38 million. Mayne also announced that Optus Communications, in which it has a 25 percent stake, had earnings before tax of A$59 million for the period, up from A$7 million a year earlier. Mayne plans to float off or sell the stake. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
ECAT	Malaysia's broad monetary aggregate, M3, expanded by 22.7 percent year-on-year in 1996 against 22.3 percent in 1995, the central Bank Negara said in its annual report for 1996 on Friday. During the year itself, the M3 aggregate fell sharply due to a tightening of monetary policy. "M3 growth ended the year with 22.7 percent from a high of 27 percent at the end of March and April," the annual report said. Similarly, M2 growth moderated to 20.9 percent from a peak of 27.9 percent at the end of April, 1996, and 24 percent in 1995. However, M1 expanded at a faster 18.3 percent in 1996 against 11.7 percent in the previous year. "This is a rate (of M3 increase) we would feel uncomfortable with, particularly since it came from credit growth," said a spokesperson of Bank Negara at the annual report presentation. "We would be more comfortable if it is below 20 percent, but we don't do monetary targetting," she said. -- Kuala Lumpur newsroom (603-230 8911)
ECAT	Australian business conditions remained relatively subdued in the June quarter, consistent with underlying growth of 2.5 to three percent, the latest National Australia Bank (NAB) quarterly business survey has found. The NAB said that in aggregate terms, trading conditions improved slightly during the second quarter of 1997, but profitability performance deteriorated a little further and there was continued job shedding.   Conditions across sectors and states remain mixed, NAB said. "Construction, transport and storage and property services have turned around over recent quarters and are improving modestly," NAB chief economist Alan Oster said in a statement. Financial and personal and recreational services continued to perform relatively well, and there was a marked improvement in retailing mainly due to better trading conditions. "Manufacturing and wholesaling continue to perform poorly," Oster said, adding that mining, a previously good performer, had reported poor conditions in the quarter for the first time since late 1995.   On a state basis, Victoria and Queensland experienced small improvements, while Western Australia reported poor conditions for the first time since mid-1993. The weakest conditions continued to be experienced in South Australia, NAB said. The NAB survey also included a measure of current business conditions, and found it less optimistic than the traditional measure based on future expectations. In the June quarter, "actual" confidence was negative three, compared with expectations of 14 points in the previous survey. Confidence for the September quarter eased to 10 points, reflecting deterioration in small and medium sized firms.   The survey found conditions were expected to improve in the third quarter, but Oster noted that this may be too optimistic given current activity levels, continued de-stocking intentions and subdued forward orders. Employment fell in the quarter, against expectations. "Current labour shedding is also more pronounced in large businesses - with the latter indicating that further downsizing is expected over the next year," Oster said. Labour costs growth fell to 0.7 percent from over one percent, moderating in all sectors except construction and financial services.   However, there remain concerns about wage pressures over the next year in construction and transport and storage. About 40 percent of respondents covering about 70 percent of employees in the survey, expected to complete wage agreements in the next year, with wages expected to rise by 3.5 percent. Firms in construction anticipated outcomes of five percent or more. Overall, a weakish labour market is expected to prevent any generalised wage pressures, and firms anticipate sizeable productivity offsets in wage agreements. Further out, output and profitability conditions are expected to improve over the next year, but not employment.   Moderation in June quarter price pressures to 0.07 percent, from 0.24 percent in March, together with reported poor profitability levels indicated a continuing economy wide squeeze on margins, and pointing to a good quarterly inflation result NAB said. After the survey, NAB had lowered its GDP forecast for 1997/98 (July/June) to 3.25 percent from 3.5 percent. Although NAB expects the second half of calendar 1997 to be stronger than the first half, short-term weakness in activity is seen keeping the unemployment rate around 8.75 percent, before it falls progressively in 1997/98.   Inflation will remain subdued in 1997, but underlying inflation will be rising in 1998 and wage pressures were unlikely to fall below four percent, NAB said. NAB also said official interest rates were likely to be cut from their current 5.5 percent level in the next month, before heading moderating higher during 1998. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
GCAT	A man wielding a sledgehammer on Friday badly damaged the Auld Mug, the America's Cup yachting trophy that Team New Zealand won in 1995, police said. They said a man dressed in a suit walked into the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron in Auckland where the cup is housed, and went unchallenged to the room where the cup is displayed in a glass case. The man pulled out the sledgehammer and began striking the glass case in a frenzied attack, police spokeswoman Joanne Gibbs said. Gibbs said the man arrived at the squadron rooms at the Westhaven marina about noon, possibly with the sledgehammer hidden in his suit. "The next thing they know he is smashing at the cabinet the cup is in. He has been arrested and is helping us down at central (station) with our inquiries," Gibbs said. The man was slightly injured by broken glass from the cup cabinet. Police did not identify the man but described him as a Maori whom they believed to be some sort of activist. They did not say if any charges had been filed against him. A spokesman for the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron said the cup was badly damaged around the mid section. "It is quite extensively damaged to the main centre piece." No estimate of the damage was immediately available, but the cup was insured for US$2 million when it was held by the San Diego Yacht Club. Sir Peter Blake, who masterminded the Team New Zealand challenge to wrest the cup from the San Diego Yacht Club in May, 1995, was reported to be devastated by the attack. Club commodore John Heise said Sir Peter was "understandably shocked and dismayed, particularly that we have gone out of our way to make the cup available to New Zealanders who want to look at the cup". Other trustees had been inclined to lock it away. "We have taken the attitude that it is New Zealand's cup and New Zealanders can look at it. It is very disappointing that something like this can happen to it." Heise said it was sickening to see the badly damaged cup lying half in and half out of the case. The cup was likely to be sent back to the manufacturers, Garrards, in England, for repairs. He said the company apparently still had the original drawings of the trophy, which was made about 1850. Heise said until it was sent back to Garrards, it was impossible to say if the cup could be successfully restored. The Auld Mug is up for grabs again in the year 2000.

GCAT	Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas on Monday called for an emergency meeting of southeast Asian foreign ministers to discuss Cambodia, which is teetering on the brink of civil war. "I think there is a need for ASEAN foreign ministers to gather, even though only for a short period, to discuss the situation in Cambodia," he told reporters at parliament. Cambodia, together with Laos and Burma, is due to join the seven-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations at the regular, annual meeting of foreign ministers in Kuala Lumpur last this month. But Alatas said he was trying to contact Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the current ASEAN chairman, "on possibility of ASEAN foreign ministers meeting on this issue". ASEAN currently comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Both Alatas and President Suharto called for an end to the fighting in Cambodia. "The president said the situation in Cambodia should be resolved peacefully and the parties involved should restrain themselves," Indonesia's ambassador-at-large Nana Sutresna said after meeting Suharto. Long simmering rivalry between Cambodia's co-prime ministers, former communist party chief Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, erupted into fighting in the capital at the weekend. Suharto also discussed Cambodia with visiting Japanese vice-foreign minister Kazuo Ogura. "We discussed the situation in Cambodia, and we hope ASEAN will be able to make a positive contribution in finding a solution to the problem," Ogura told reporters. Alatas said Indonesia was following developments in Cambodia with great concern and urged "all parties to immediately cease their recourse to armed force and to solve whatever problems they may have through dialogue". "We really think that the situation is quite serious, and we are frankly disappointed that despite the commitment and the assurances they have given to us, to ASEAN, this conflict still reaches this proportion," he said. He said any ASEAN agreement on Cambodia would come from a consensus between the member countries. "We see this problem as an internal matter which is a conflict between two parties, and ASEAN will decide its steps together," Alatas said.
ECAT	The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Friday defended its key Consumer Price Index from criticism made late last year by a blue-ribbon commission. In a report responding to the Boskin Commission study, BLS researchers questioned several of its assumptions and rejected many of its conclusions point by point. The commission, headed by Stanford University economist Michael Boskin, concluded in December that the CPI overstates inflation by about 1.1 percentage point per year. In its response, the BLS charged the Boskin commission with making numerous inaccurate inferences based on faulty or incomplete data. The paper also noted that the BLS is engaged in several programs to improve the accuracy of the CPI. "The BLS specifically rejects several of the estimated quality or new goods biases, in cases where the commission presented new evidence," the BLS study's authors said. The paper was released at a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, which had requested a BLS response to the Boskin report.   The BLS partially agreed with Boskin that the CPI's failure to account for switching between similar goods when prices move has artificially inflated the index. And it agreed that upper-level substitution bias adds about 0.15-percentage point to CPI annually. But the paper disagreed that lower level substitution bias adds up to 0.49 points a year. "The commission fails to mention several strong assumptions about the distribution of price changes that they implicitly use," the report stated. The BLS also disputed Boskin's assertion that unmeasured quality gains in new and improved goods add 0.61 percentage points annually to CPI. The BLS highlighted shelter, apparel and upkeep, and new and used cars -- which Boskin said together account for 0.16 of the 0.61 points -- citing lack of evidence and poor estimates. "In each of these cases, there are significant problems with the inferences drawn by the commission," the report said. Estimates of a 0.34-point bias in medical care and high-tech consumer goods involved "some degree of speculation and extrapolation," the BLS report continued.   In addition, the paper said its current experimental CPI, which uses a geometric rather than an arithmetic mean to account for substitution bias, lowers the growth of CPI by about 0.25 percentage points a year. The BLS agreed with Boskin's recommendation that CPI should be fashioned as much as possible as a cost-of-living index. Many key U.S. economic inputs, including tax payments and entitlement spending, are tied to CPI. But the paper asserted that current efforts to improve CPI would take years to bear fruit, and may never catch up with the mercurial U.S. economy. "The solutions to many CPI measurement issues ... must await methodological breakthroughs in economics or improved availability of data," the report concluded. ((-- Chris Stetkiewicz, 202-898-8377 ))
GCAT	Australian legspinners Michael Bevan and Shane Warne grabbed seven wickets between them to demolish the West Indies' batting lineup before tea on the first day of their fourth test match on Saturday. Left armed legspinner Bevan took four wickets in a startling 28 ball spell that utterly mesmerised a tentative and distracted West Indies middle and lower order. West Indies capitulated to be all out for 130 just over an hour after the lunch break, having gone to lunch at 82 for five on what was generally seen as a good batting pitch. This is the West Indies second lowest total against Australia at the Adelaide Oval since 1951/52, when they scored 105. It is their fourth batting collapse in a row on this tour. Australia made a solid start to their first innings and were 29 for no wicket at tea against a depleted West Indies pace attack. Bevan, in his first match as a recognised bowler, finished with four for 31. He has previously played as a batsman who bowled occasionally, but was selected for this match as a second spinner after a dramatic improvement this season. The 26 year old had started poorly, bowling too full and wide to the West Indies top order who were only too happy to drive him to the boundary. But once he found a good length, the West Indies just could not cope with his bouncy leg-spinners that approach medium pace on occasion. Warne was also in destructive form, taking the prize wicket of an in-form Brian Lara before lunch with his first ball to the left-hander, delighting a capacity crowd of over 20,000 at the tree-lined and sun-drenched Adelaide Oval. Warne took two wickets for seven runs in his first two overs, including that of Chivnarine Chanderpaul who has been the West Indies' most consistent batsman on tour. He finished with three for 42. The West Indies are expected to struggle to dismiss Australia cheaply on a pitch settling into a good batting wicket. Strike fast bowler Curtly Ambrose, the chief destroyer for the West Indies in their third test win in Melbourne, was forced to withdraw at the last minute after failing a morning fitness test with a strained groin. The West Indies have also lost paceman Kenny Benjamin, who returned earlier this month with a side strain. Ambrose and Benjamin have been replaced by Cameron Cuffy and Patterson Thompson, who have three test matches of experience between them. Australia lead the five test series 2-1 and only need to draw or win this match to retain the Frank Worrell Trophy, which they won in 1995 in the Caribbean when they were the first team to beat the West Indies in a test series for 15 years.
CCAT	Brokerage UBS lowered its recommendation on French glassmaker Saint-Gobain to 'sell' from 'neutral' and cut its earnings estimates for the group, fund managers said on Friday. UBS judged Saint-Gobain's 1996 results disappointing and believes the stock overvalued, they said. Natwest Sellier maintains its "hold" recommendation on Saint-Gobain after the group announced 1996 results in line with its expectations, one broker said.

ECAT	South Korea's finance ministry said on Wednesday it would try to minimise damage to the financial markets as a result of troubles at the Kia Group by maintaining flexible money supply. "We will supply money flexibly lest Kia's troubles cause concerns within the financial markets," a ministry statement said. Repurchase agreements would be used to ease instability in the short-term money market. The central bank supplied one trillion won through repurchase agreements on Tuesday and an additional 500 billion won on Wednesday.   The ministry also said it would strengthen its financial support to Kia's subcontractors. "We will ask financial institutions to extend repayments of loans to Kia's subcontractors," the ministry statement said. The central bank would raise funds through sales of monetary stabilisation bonds to support the subcontractors' operating expenses On Tuesday, local banks launched a rescue of the Kia Group, which ran into financial troubles due to slumping sales in its carmaking flagship and heavy investments in its steel unit.
ECAT	Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said on Saturday that consumer price inflation was now firmly in a range of 1.5 percent to 1.8/1.9 percent year-on-year. "Inflation is now clearly in a range of 1.5 to 1.8/1.9 percent," Ciampi told reporters as he left to attend a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers. Economists estimated that Italian consumer prices would rise 1.5 percent year-on-year in June after the release of preliminary inflation data by five sample cities on Friday.
ECAT	Venezuelans will soon begin to reap the benefits of improved economic growth has the improvements of the the past year begin to reach them, Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff said. "Most people still haven't begun to climb the slope, but they're not going to start sliding down it either," Petkoff said in an interview on Union Radio. "People have put their first foot on the hill...over the course of the year they'll begin to climb."   Petkoff was speaking on the eve of the first anniversary of President Rafael Caldera's speech on April 15 last year when he launched a tough package of IMF-sponsored reforms, called Venezuelan Agenda. The reforms -- backed by a fortunate spike in international oil prices -- have led to falling inflation, rising international reserves, renewed international confidence and improved growth prospects, with the economy set to grow 3.3 percent this year after shrinking 1.6 percent in 1996. But the measures also caused rising unemployment and a series strikes that rocked Venezuela earlier this year.   "This year will see significant wage increases and, shortly, a new higher minimum wage. People will soon be feeling better in their pocketbooks," Petkoff said. As part of a ground-breaking reform of the crumbling social security system now under congressional discussion, all Venezuelan workers will soon receive advances on accumulated severance payments. The payments, called "prestaciones", or literally "borrowings", work as a sort of pension scheme under which workers receive a lump sum when they leave a job. The amount depends on the number of years worked. Petkoff added that, despite the fall in March inflation to 1.6 percent -- the lowest in five years, inflation was still too high. "...it has to come down further, although if you compare it with 12.6 percent in May last year, it's pretty good," he said. Central Bank officials have said that pending salary increases will add some five percentage points to year-end inflation, officially targeted at 35 percent.

GCAT	South Africa's cabinet will decide within weeks whether to challenge Egypt and arch-rival Nigeria for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said on Thursday. Pahad told Reuters South African envoys from New York, Vienna, Geneva and Addis Ababa, seat of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), had met recently to discuss the expected contest for Africa's first permanent seat on the Security Council. "We will put options to the ministers and they will have to take the final decision, but one of the options will be whether South Africa should contest the seat and the cabinet will have to decide that very soon," he said in an interview. A U.N. working group is discussing reforms including the proposed expansion of the 15-nation Security Council, of which the United States, Britain, Russia, China and France are the permanent members with the right to veto council decisions. The United States has backed the inclusion of Germany and Japan and three permanent seats for the developing world, but has not said which Third World countries should join. The OAU has called for two permanent seats for Africa alone and an additional two seats that will rotate among other countries on the continent. The existing permanent members have all said they would not tolerate any dilution of their veto powers, but have not agreed what powers the new members should have. "As part of the OAU and the Non-Aligned Movement, we support the position that there should be no differentiation between permanent members. Either the veto must go completely or all members should have the same veto powers," said Pahad. He said the OAU had asked members not to declare their interest in Security Council seats until an internal discussion was complete, but that Nigeria and Egypt had publicly announced their intention to vie for the seat. South Africa has been at loggerheads with Nigeria since President Nelson Mandela called for sanctions against military leader Sani Abacha's government after the execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other democracy campaigners in 1995. Diplomatic sources in South Africa and Zimbabwe said recently Nigeria was opposing South Africa's bid to host the Olympic Games in 2004. "There is a very strong feeling in international circles that if there are one or two seats for Africa, South Africa should contest," Pahad said. "But we have to look at the implications in terms of human resources, financial implications and general responsibility. The cabinet will have to decide whether we are willing to take on these very significant obligations." Pahad, who is generally far more visible than elderly Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, said a permanent seat would commit South Africa to greater financial and manpower contributions and could involve greater involvement in peace-keeping operations. "Of course, being a permanent member of the Security Council also means you're in the big league and advantages come with that in terms of interacting with the major powers on issues of international importance and the ability to influence, if necessary, important decisions," he said.
ECAT	Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Wednesday that it was the government's policy to keep interest rates low. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) earlier announced a 0.5 percentage point reduction in official cash interest rates to 5.0 percent, the fifth rate cut in a year.   "Having got interest rates down, I can assure you it is very much part of our policy to keep them there," Costello told reporters. He said the rate cuts announced in late 1996 were still working their way through the economy and that the benefits of the remaining two rate cuts were yet to materialise. The central bank began lowering rates last July, with two cuts in the final few months of 1996, one on May 23 this year, and again on Wednesday. Each time it reduced the official cash rate by 50 basis points.   "Interest rates work their way through the economy on a 12 month to 18 month delay," Costello said. "What that means is that we are now - business is now -- just starting to feel the benefits of rate reductions that were occurring in the latter part of last year," he said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
CCAT	TeleCheck Services, a unit of First Data Corp, said Saturday that same-store sales rose 3.6 percent on Friday compared to the day after Thanksgiving a year ago. The day after Thanksgiving is traditionally the busiest day in terms of shopping traffic.   "One day does not make a season, however, and with this good start, TeleCheck anticipates a 2-to-4-percent same store sales gain during the entire holiday shopping period," William Ford, TeleCheck's senior economic advisor, said in a news release. Sales rose 9.3 percent in the Southwest, 5.6 percent in the Mid-Atlantic region, 4.4 percent in the West, 3.9 percent in the Southeast and 3.3 percent in the Midwest, TeleCheck said. Sales in the Northeast fell 3.9 percent, according to the survey of checks written at 15,000 TeleCheck subscribers, TeleCheck said. The figures are not adjusted for inflation. --Reuters Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787
MCAT	MGE spring wheat futures ended mixed after an extremely quiet session, and traders said the light volume would make it difficult to read anything into the price action. "I'm even wondering if we traded one million bushels today. That's how quiet it was," a trader said. Traders said Wilson bought March wheat at the outset, and had picked up at least 500,000 March by the early midsession. ome guessed that this was tied to commercial short covering. Atwood-Peavey reportedly sold 350,000 May bushels early, then bought back 250,000 later. MGE spring wheat ended three cents per bushel lower to 1-3/4 cents higher, with March up one cent at $3.87-1/2. MGE barley did not trade and closed unchanged. ((--Greg Frost, 816 561-8671))
ECAT	The Cahners Business Confidence Index (CBCI) rose to 67.4 in August from 65.3 in July, according to a report by Cahners Economics. "Business confidence has responded favorably to the likelihood the Fed will remain on the sidelines for several months to come," the report said. Sixty-nine percent of the 400 manufacturers surveyed rated current business conditions as "good/excellent." Four of seven CBCI components rose in August. The employment portion climbed farthest, gaining 2.7 points to stand at 67.5.   Readings of inventories, production and marketing spending increased in August as well. Of the three individual indices that fell, capital spending turned in the greatest decline, slipping 2.2 percent to 75.2 in August. More than 60 percent of respondents said policies aimed at economic growth should be the presidential candidates' first economic priority, the report said. Fewer than 20 percent of respondents said controlling inflation should be first priority, it said. The CBCI is computed monthly from a telephone survey of 400 senior and mid-level managers in the manufacturing sector. --Scott Gerlach, 212-859-1868
ECAT	Employers have grown more confident about taking on new workers in coming months, reflecting their outlook for steady economic growth in 1997, according to a survey of business economists released Sunday. In a quarterly survey of 127 members of the National Association of Business Economists, about 42 percent said their companies plan to increase hiring over the next six months. That's up from 24 percent in October's survey. Roughly half of the economists said they expect the economy to continue growing at an "average" pace, compared with 44 percent in the previous survey. NABE President Mark Dadd said the survey did not ask for specific growth forecasts but he pegged "average growth" at about 2.5 percent a year. "This is a pretty solid rate of growth for this stage in the expansion," Dadd told Reuters. "The expansion looks secure." Another 42 percent of those surveyed forecast sluggish growth, while the rest were evenly split between strong growth and recession. The survey of the group's members, who include economists from a broad range of U.S. companies, found that demand for products and services increased markedly in the fourth quarter and more than compensated for a third quarter slowdown. Despite the higher demand, businesses have had difficulty raising prices in a competitive business environment, the survey showed. Only 21 percent reported increased selling prices for their goods and services, while 14 percent reported falling prices. Continued shortages of skilled labour were reported at about half of the firms surveyed. Despite the lengthier expansions of recent years, most of the economists surveyed "still firmly believe in business cycles," the group said. "Business economists don't believe the business cycle is dead, it's merely slumbering," said the NABE's Dadd, who is also chief economist for AT&T Corp.
MCAT	LIFFE coffee futures regained some strength after early sharp falls to end Tuesday mixed with some nearbys returning to the positive territory. Traders said a technical upward reversal in New York after Monday's heavy sell-off also inspired renewed buying in London in the afternoon. "We may have seen lower levels in New York. The market needs a short-term correction on the upside," said one trader. London's benchmark May was driven to an intraday low of $1,610 a tonne before staging a rebound to a peak of $1,708. It closed just $8 up at $1,698. Other traded positions were $40 down to $12 up. The market had earlier failed to meet its pre-opening expectation of $100-$200 down based on the steep decline on the New York arabica futures overnight. Roasters stepped up buying in the morning as prices made their way lower. Jobbers were seen on the selling side but they retreated as the market turned around. "This initiated speculative buying and roasters also paid up," said one trader. "Funds which had been selling in last few days were not willing to sell at higher prices." The market's volume reached a modest at 5,099 lots. Active May/July switches were traded from $3 to $12. On the charts, May faces a key support at $1,600 and the upside target is seen at the double top of $1,820-$1,825. Broker GNI said earlier on Tuesday the recent retail price increase by major U.S. and European roasters could be a dampener to the recent explosive rally in bean prices. "We have been saying for some time that prices are due to fall due to the recent roaster price increases," it said in a commentary. "The question now is how far can they fall before trade buying comes in and the specs start going long ahead of the (Brazilian) frost season." The U.S. Green Coffee Association data released after the New York market had closed on Monday showed a larger-than-anticipated rise of 204,000 60-kg bags to 1.54 million bags in February from January. The market had anticipated an increase of 50,000 to 100,000 tonnes. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985
MCAT	*Dlr/yen down but above 112.90 low. Treasury's Rubin supports strong dollar after early Bentsen remark knocks below 113. *Dealers see good appetite for dollar/yen at lows, Japan public fund rumored bidding for dollars on way down. *Dlr/mark, Swiss lose ground after early long liquidation. *U.S. assets turn down, hurting dollar, despite good jobs data. The dollar closed lower against most leading currencies after former United States Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said a stronger dollar could harm U.S. exporters. Bentsen, in an interview with Reuters Financial Television, said he was "comfortable" with the dollar's current strong exchange rate. But, referring to the dollar's value against the yen, he added: "If it continues to rise and goes substantially above this, of course, it puts us at a competitive disadvantage. I would prefer not to see it increase in value." After briefly trading below the important 113 yen threshold, the dollar recovered somewhat when Robert Rubin, the administration's current Treasury chief told reporters at a press conference "we believe in a strong dollar." "Bentsen's comment pushed it lower but then Treasury Secretary Rubin made a comment which took the dollar back up," said Kisoo Park, senior foreign exchange dealer at Bank of Boston. "I would presume Rubin carries more weight." The dollar ended at 113.35/45 yen on Friday, down from 113.67/70 yen at the open and at 1.5135/45 marks, off from 1.5185/90 marks. Bentsen served as Treasury Secretary for the first two years of the Clinton Administration. During his tenure at the Treasury, many currency traders thought he favored an informal cap on dollar/yen around 113. Bentsen gave some the impression of adhering to a policy of benign neglect of the dollar, believing a weaker U.S. currency would force trade concessions from Japan and spur sales of U.S. goods there. But while traders said Bentsen's remarks may have a fleeting impact on the market, they come amid a recent chorus of complaints about the dollar's strength. "The only thing it does signal is that there is still a body of opinion in the United States that does think the dollar is too strong at the moment," said Chris Iggo, an international economist at BZW/Barclays Bank in New York. Many large U.S. coroporations, particularly the three largest U.S. auto manufacturers, have recently voiced concern over the damage a strong dollar could inflict on foreign demand for U.S. made goods. The dollar was lifted earlier against the mark and extended its recent advance against the Swiss franc to a 20-month high at 1.2778 Swiss after a tame report on U.S. payroll growth briefly hoisted the U.S. bond market. The Labor Department showed that the unemployment rate remained steady at 5.2 percent, while non-farm payrolls increased 210,000 in October, after falling 35,000 in September. The data was very close to Wall Street forecasts. "The dollar got a slight boost from the bonds, but I don't think the bonds turning (lower) made the dollar go down," said Mark Remigio, a vice president at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi. The dollar could not hang on to gains versus the mark, which firmed in Asian trade after a German central banker, speaking in Singapore, said there was no need for a mark-damaging reduction in German interest rates. The dollar fell to 1.2690/00 Swiss francs from 1.2715/25 and to Canadian $1.3335/40 from C$1.3366/71. The pound touched $1.6445, its highest level since March 1995, but closed at $1.6360/70, off from $1.6373/80. The Australian dollar stood a $0.7889/94, up from $0.7883/88 at the open. -- Alden Bentley 212 859 1667
MCAT	Shares ended higher in massive volume on Tuesday with the HEX index tacking on more than two percent after Nokia powered up on its report of sharply higher first-quarter earnings, brokers said. The general HEX index rose 2.51 percent to 2,930.53 points and volume was a very lively 1.26 billion markka, 71 percent of which was in Nokia. The FOX derivatives and portfolio benchmark rose 2.33 percent to 1,019 points. "This has been Nokia's day," one broker said. Nokia added 20.90 markka, or more than six percent, to close at 321.90 markka. Both Nokia shares were traded heavily, with the combined volume rising above 900 million markka, to account for more than 70 percent of total bourse turnover. A higher open from U.S. stocks and bonds, and for Nokia on Wall St, bolstered sentiment late in the session, brokers said. "This now looks very bullish. If U.S. bonds stay up there and stocks follow them, then tomorrow could be quite a day," one broker said as the U.S. markets opened higher with help from Q1 employment cost data. Forestries, banks and metal shares added width to the rise, with the sub-indices up 1.07 percent, 4.06 percent and 0.98 percent respectively. Steel group Rautaruukki added 2.70 to end at 46.50 in heavy 65 million markka volume after it yesterday set its share offering price at 42.00 markka per share. As the market closed, Rautaruukki said it would up its public offering from four million shares to 7.4 million. Insurer Pohjola ended 1.00 markka higher at 148.00, helped by news that it was pursuing its plans to absorb Suomi insurance by buying Suomi's Salama shares, brokers said. The largest banking group Merita closed 0.80 markka higher at 17.20 after touching 17.20 in fairly lively trade, helped by the downward shift in interest rates late in the session, brokers said.
ECAT	Singapore has revised its forecast of 1996 gross domestic product (GDP) growth down to about six percent, and the city state registered annual growth of 3.2 percent in the third quarter, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) had previously forecast 1996 growth at between seven to eight percent, and in the first and second quarters the economy grew at annual rates of 11.4 percent and 7.5 percent respectively, according to revised figures released by Lee. Lee was speaking at a trade awards ceremony.   Lee said MTI expects 1997 growth of between five to seven percent, assuming the key electronics industry picks up in second half 1997, as the industry consensus forecasts. A recent Reuters poll of 11 economists had found their forecasts averaging 6.4 percent growth for 1996 GDP. Most expected growth in the third quarter to average slightly over 3.0 percent year-on-year. Export-driven Singapore has been hit by a worldwide slowdown in the critical electronic sector, which accounts for 44 percent of value added in Singapore manufacturing.   "A major reason for this downturn is the weak performance of manufacturing, particularly the electronics industry and related supporting industries," Lee said. He said several other manufacturing industries are also weak, including ship-repair, printing, petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lee said the MTI assessed the current slowdown as cyclical rather than secular. "It reflects a cyclical slowdown in external demand, rather than structural problems in the Singapore economy."   He said: "Externally, there are also positive signs that the current slowdown will not be too severe or prolonged," citing expected growth in the United States, Japan and China and an industry consensus the electronics slowdown has hit bottom. Given that assessment, Lee said there was no need for drastic policy adjustments, although the situation should be monitored. "Meanwhile we should maintain an even course, and accept slower growth for a few quarters until external demand picks up again," Lee said.   "The current slowdown has not changed our longer term assessment -- that Asia is set to boom for the next 20 years, that we are well placed to take advantage of this regional prosperity, and that we can aim to grow by 6-8 percent per year over the next decade," Lee said. -- Singapore newsroom 65-8703080
CCAT	Shares in Ascend Communications Inc dropped by nearly two points in after-hours trade Tuesday after the networking solutions company released earnings results that were under expectations, traders said. Dealers said Ascend traded at 52 after the bell, below an unofficial close of 53-7/8. The company posted second quarter earnings of $0.31 per share before merger costs, compared with $0.23 per share for the year ago period. According to First Call, analysts' consensus forecast the earnings results would come to $0.36 per share.   Also causing commotion after the bell was Intel Corp, the world's largest semiconductor manurfacturer. Dealers said Intel traded at 83 after-hours, well above an unofficial close of 80-29/32, also after releasing second quarter earnings performances. The company reported earnings of $0.92 per share on revenues of $6.0 billion, compared with $0.59 per share on revenues of $4.6 billion for the year-ago period. Analysts had forecast that Intel would post earnings of $0.90 per share.   Elsewhere, Amgen Inc edged downward by 1/4 point, hampered by second quarter earnings of $0.72 per share, compared with $0.64 for the same period in 1996. Dealers said the biotechnology company's stock price fell to 57 during a busy after-hours trading session, down from 57-1/4 at the U.S. market close. "It's still pretty heavy after the bell," a trader said late in the session. The accelerated trading followed an equally busy day on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 53 points to close at 7976, while the Nasdaq Composite added 18 points, rising to 1542. The New York Stock Exchange said session one volume was 40,400, compared with 104,600 on Monday. Session two volume fell to 629,189 from 3,801,339 the previous day.

ECAT	Early economic indicators all point to a steady first quarter gross national product (GNP) growth, a senior Philippine official said on Tuesday. Socorro Zingapan, director of the National Planning and Policy Staff of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), said although it was too early to predict the first quarter GNP growth rate, early indicators showed steady growth. "We have a good export growth rate in the first two months of the year," she told Reuters. Merchandise exports rose by 55 percent in the first two months of the year to $4.685 billion from $3.014 billion a year-ago. She said the agriculture sector, which contributed substantially in last year's growth, did not suffer from drought nor heavy flooding during the period. "There's no bad news coming out from the agriculture sector. There's no request to import," she added. The preliminary figures are scheduled to be released by the end of next month. Earlier, NEDA director-general Cielito Habito said he expected first quarter GNP to expand by between six to 6.5 percent. Zingapan said the government did not scale down its full-year GNP growth projection of between seven to eight percent for this year. Philippine GNP grew by 6.8 percent last year, the highest growth rate since 1990. -- Manila Newsroom (63 2) 841-8938 Fax 817-6267
MCAT	Investors should seek value at the short end of peripheral European curves as prospects for further monetary easing swell, analysts said on Thursday. Little change is likely after Thursday's monetary meetings in France, Switzerland and Britain, while in Sweden too rates are likely to remain on hold. But in Italy and Spain expected easings near term offer the most investor opportunities. "Investors should be looking at the short ends in continental Europe for curve steepening trades," said Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW in London. "This trend can continue across the board but the most interesting will be the Spanish and Italian front ends." Key Spanish inflation data due on Friday and a good inflation performance in Italy have led many analysts to expect rate cuts in the near future. Reed said if the Spanish consumer price index was in line with expectations there could be an intervention rate cut as early as Tuesday. "In Italy the government is not out of the woods completely, but there is a mini-budget which opens the door to further Bank of Italy easing especially given the inflation performance," she said. Teis Knuthsen, international economist at Frist Chicago in London, agreed. He said while both the Italian and Spanish markets had seen some curve steepeninng over the past few days, the interest rate futures were still too conservatively priced. At 1041 GMT, LIFFE June Eurolira futures were at 93.04, down 0.03 on the day. But Huw Roberts, European bond strategist at NatWest Markets in London said to a large extent a rate cut had been priced in in Spain. "The reality of a rate cut won't have that much of a beneficial impact, it is largely discounted already," he said. "Italy is a little more difficult to call. It has steepened up quite aggressively over the last week or so but that is as much of a reaction to dramatic curve flattening over January and February." Knuthsen said in Sweden too there was the possibility that the Riksbank would cut rates, but not until after the government announces its budget on April 15. "If there is a favourable reception it is very likely the Riksbank will cut rates once more," he said. But some analysts said there was an argument to be made for buying into Swedish bonds now. "In an international context Sweden is in an enviable position on its public finances," said John McNeill, bond market strategist at I.D.E.A. in London. "All the fundamentals are in place...and the market is very undemandingly priced." Elsewhere in Europe, analysts said the Bank of France may cut its 5-10 day rate but that was likely to have little impact. "If they cut by 10 basis points it will be at 4.5 percent, which is where the German Lombard rate is so will harmonise their short term interest rates. It is more likely to be on that side than the intervention rate," said Roberts. Reed said there was scope for a small cut in the intervention rate, which is currently at 3.10 percent. "The French franc is firm enough to allow for such a thing. It may not be today, but any time now," she said. Knuthsen said aside from Italy, Spain and Sweden it was difficult to be too bouyant for European interest rate futures. "For core Europe we are now past the point where further rate cuts can be expected," he said. "We will get into a period where gradually markets will start to price in the first tightening. If anything the chance is that the markets will be too aggressive in anticipating rate hikes in core Europe which are very unlikely to appear in 1997." --International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 4041

CCAT	Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) managing director David Murray, buoyant after a surprisingly strong profit result, said on Thursday that CBA had decided to expand its presence in Asia and New Zealand. Murray also said CBA had submitted a first-round non-binding bid to buy Axiom Funds Mangement, which manages A$17 billion of funds and is being sold by the New South Wales state government.   "We've already expanded our presence in Asia and we're about to start our joint venture bank in Indonesia, but I think there's more up there for us to do and we've decided to seek out some fresh opportunities," Murray told reporters after addressing a Securities Institute function. "Our focus has been Indonesia, China, Vietnam and India because they are countries whose financial systems are still evolving because the Australian system, which is one we know very well, is quite mature," he said.   "We're looking in each of those countries for joint venture opportunities," he said, adding such joint venture arrangements would not require significant capital injections from CBA. CBA announced an 11 percent rise in net profit for the six months to December 31 to A$602 million and increased its interim dividend by seven cents to 45 cents per share. The result was well above expectations and fired a four percent rally in CBA's share price to A$13.90. The stock closed up two cents at A$13.93 on Thursday as the overall market rallied another one percent to an all-time high.   Murray said CBA was looking to diversify and expand in New Zealand as well as Asia, and was examining acquisition opportunities and the potential for organic growth of its ASB Bank unit there. He said CBA had been successful in New Zealand with ASB Bank, but that it still had only a relatively small presence. "So if we had any opportunities to expand any further, we'd like to take them, because we know the market and we think we could provide a pretty good service there," he said.   Murray agreed that the only large bank in New Zealand not already owned by CBA or its Australian competitors was the National Bank of New Zealand Ltd, which is owned by Lloyds TSB Group Plc. Murray said CBA had enough capital on hand to handle routine expansion and therefore would continue with its current high dividend payout ratio. CBA would go back to shareholders either to adjust its dividend payout ratio or to raise capital through a share issue if it wanted to make a larger than routine acquisition, Murray said. He would not specify how big a war-chest CBA had.   Meanwhile, Murray said the squeeze in home loan margins from about 300 basis points early last year to about 150 basis points now may have reached its limit. CBA stunned the home lending market on Wednesday when it cut its key variable home mortgage rate to 7.55 percent from 8.25 percent, its second unilateral rate cut in less than a year. A similar sized unilateral cut in May last year was seen as the catalyst to a significant cut in big bank home loan margins. "We're either at or fast approaching a margin which is very competitive in world terms for home mortgages," Murray told reporters.   "I therefore believe that the process from here will be incremental." Murray also took the opportunity to dismiss speculation that CBA was about to securitise its entire home loan portfolio and return the then un-necessary capital to shareholders. He said the global trend  mutual funds would increase the pressure for funding mortgages through securitisation. "This does not mean that we are going to run out tomorrow and securitise our whole home loan book because there is not enough buyers out there and enough funds to take it because of their asset allocations," he said.   -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
MCAT	Toronto stocks finished mixed on Wednesday after weak bonds offset gains in most sectors, including a rumor-driven rally in transportation. The TSE 300 Composite Index rose 11.88 points to close at 5163.77. But declining stocks outnumbered advancers 447 to 421, with 302 issues ending flat. Trading was active, with 72.17 million shares changing hands for a total value of C$926.85 million (US$676 million). "It wasn't too bad in light of the fact that the bond market had another weak day," said John Kellett, vice-president of equities for Royal Bank of Canada. Canadian bonds finished weaker along with a sluggish U.S. market as investors await key U.S. jobs data on Friday. Trading was heavier on the TSE than Tuesday's post-holiday session, but Kellett said some investors are still sidelined. "Too many people recall that September and October are not great months and they're not prepared to get too aggressive at this stage," he said. Among the TSE's 14 sub-groups, transportation added over 100 points. Other strong sectors included energy, banking, base metals and conglomerates. --- HOT STOCKS --- * Waste and transport giant Laidlaw Inc. class B topped the most-active list, climbing 0.35 to 13.50 on 3.8 million shares. Laidlaw rallied on market speculation that Republic Industries was planning to buy Laidlaw's solid waste unit. Both companies denied the rumors. * Thomson Corp. pulled down the communications group, losing 0.45 to 24.35, despite news that the publisher won a television license for a new business news channel. * Newbridge Networks Corp. jumped 2.15 to 82.80 after releasing industry studies which named Newbridge the market leader in network switch sales.
MCAT	Calcutta shares prices moved within a narrow range on Thursday to close mixed with neither speculators nor foreign funds showing interest in blue-chips, brokers said. They said speculators retreated from the market not sure of short-term trends, ahead of Saturday's new credit policy announcement by the Reserve Bank of India. Analysts said that marginal lowering of interest rates was expected, and that would trigger a short-term rally. "... but the medium term outlook for the equity market seems very bleak. There may be speculative gains but large fresh investments will continue to be scarce. Indices in western markets are on the rise and foreign funds are focussing more on those markets than investments in emerging markets like India," said an analyst with brokers C. Mackertich. -- Calcutta newsroom +91-33-4746544
CCAT	Norfolk Southern Corp said Monday that it is talking with CSX Corp about their respective offers to acquire Conrail Inc. "The basis for NS's participation in these discussions is its commitment to provide strong competitive service in the East for rail customers," Norfolk said in a release.   Norfolk Southern has been vying with CSX to acquire Philadelpha-based Conrail. Last week Norfolk sued to block CSX's proposed $8.4 billion merger with Conrail, after launching an unsolicited $100 cash per share bid for Conrail.
GCAT	If Canada's John de Chastelain is named head of a body to disarm guerrillas in Northern Ireland he is likely to find himself drawing heavily on his ample military and diplomatic experience. Cool under fire and expert at smoothing ruffled feathers, John Gardyne Drummond de Chastelain worked himself up from private to four-star general and Canada's top soldier during 40 years in the military before retiring at the end of 1995. But he also served during 1993 as Canada's ambassador to the United States, and during his time in the military he had to deal with touchy hot spots, from Cyprus and the Gulf War to a military standoff at home with Canadian Mohawk Indians. "If anybody could be said to be ideal for the job, he'd be the guy," commented retired Brigadier General Jim Hanson, who worked under de Chastelain. De Chastelain is already on a three-man commission led by former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell that is trying to bring peace to Northern Ireland, and his name is most often mentioned as a potential head of an arms-decommissioning panel. Born in Romania on July 30, 1937, to British-American parents who worked for Allied intelligence during the Second World War, he went to boarding school in Scotland and then in 1955 joined the Calgary Highlanders in Canada as a bagpiper. Hanson suggested he might need his sense of humor and individuality to survive among the hardened parties in the Northern Ireland conflict, where the Irish Republican Army (IRA) is seeking an end to British rule. De Chastelain still dons a kilt to play the bagpipe or to join Scottish country dancing. He displayed a delightful sense of bravado in his five years as chief of defense staff -- the top military position -- when he frequently parachuted into Canadian bases as a way of meeting ordinary soldiers and showing who is in charge. "A lot of people thought I shouldn't have been jumping, that I'd break a leg or something," he recounted four years ago to the Financial Post. "Some people would say, 'How come they let you?' And I'd say, 'Who's they?'" He did receive a black mark in July from an independent Canadian commission that looked into Canada's botched mission to Somalia, during which peacekeepers shot two unarmed Somalis in the back as they fled, killing one, and tortured to death a teenager. Those incidents took place when he was ambassador. But the report said he had not put adequate controls in place or ensured the peacekeepers were prepared for deployment. The soldiers were members of Canada's elite Airborne Regiment, which was eventually disbanded after the killings and after details of foul initiation rituals were revealed. "General de Chastelain's primary failure may be characterized as one of nonexistent control and indifferent supervision ... that fostered more failings among his subordinates," the commission concluded. Hanson sought to excuse the general by saying the whole military system tended to function by trusting subordinates. But he did say of his work in Northern Ireland: "What he'll have to be is extremely cautious, and to see everyting in writing or hand-carved." De Chastelain himself recognizes the difficulties. He spoke this month about the damage the years of fighting has done to the confidence each side has of the other. "There is a lack of trust on the part of some of the parties, in particular the Unionist parties (pressing for continued British rule), that Sinn Fein and the IRA are really serious," he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
ECAT	Big tax cuts without spending reductions would risk taking the U.S. economy back to where it was five years ago where the budget deficit was one of the major barriers to global growth, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said on Friday. "Large-scale, multi-hundred billion dollar, tax cuts -- if not paid for with spending reductions -- would...do tremendous damage by taking us back to the situation five years ago where the U.S. budget deficit was one of, if not the, largest problem thwarting the healthy growth of the global economy," Summers told bankers at a luncheon in Singapore.   Summers said it was a political as well as a social judgement rather than an economic judgement whether there are ways of cutting spending acceptable to the United States as a society that would be consistent with those large cuts. "On the evidence of the spending cuts that were necessary to finance (U.S. House Republican Speaker) Newt Gingrich's tax cuts...I don't think that there is a politically or socially acceptable way of financing very large-scale across-the-board tax cuts," he said. He added it was unfortunate that large scale tax cuts were advocated without specific details of which programmes would be reduced to pay for them.

GCAT	A century by captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul frustrated the Indian bowlers after they had made a mess of Guyana's upper order batsman during the second day of their four-day match on Saturday. Guyana had been reduced to 95 for five when the West Indies test batsman came in. An unbeaten 103 by Chanderpaul allowed Guyana to reach 214 for six at the close in reply to India's first innings total of 341 all out. Chanderpaul and Vishal Nagamootoo, who was not out 20 at the close, added 83 runs in an unbeaten seventh wicket partnership. Dodanarsiah Ganesh was the pick of the Indian bowlers with three for 46 off 15 overs. Earlier, India, resuming at 294 for five overnight had, not for the first time during their tour, collapsed after appearing to be in a dominant position, losing their last five wickets for only 47 runs. Paceman Reon King, who took three wickets on Friday, was the scourge of the Indian batsman, taking a further four to finish with figures of seven for 82.
CCAT	Only eight percent of German retailers plan to lengthen their store hours in November to take advantage of a more liberal law, according to a survey by a business information agency. Of the 1,800 retailers surveyed, 37 percent plan not to extend their hours at all, while the remainder will wait and see how things develop, said Helmut Roedl, president of the Verband der Vereinte Creditreform. The change will do virtually nothing to create new jobs, Roedl said. Most retailers plan to use part-time employees to meet greater demand, rather than hire new full-timers. The German government, hoping to boost the economy, enacted a more liberal shop opening hours law in June, over objections from the industry and unions. -- Terence Gallagher, Bonn newsroom, 49 228 26097150
MCAT	This week's active U.S. Plains feedlot cattle sales broke week-to-date record high levels, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Texas Panhandle/western Oklahoma feedlots by Wednesday had posted a week-to-date figure of 141,600, topping the previous record of 136,800 set for the week ended February 22nd this year, USDA said. Kansas feedlot sales for the week through Wednesday were 118,800, above the 115,059 level set the week ended July 28, 1995, according to USDA. Daily record highs remained intact despite Wednesday's active sales. The record high level for daily sales in the Panhandle area is 104,800 set February 22 this year, and the daily record high in Kansas at 88,000 was set last September. There were 96,600 head reported sold Tuesday in the Panhandle and 70,100 in Kansas. Cattle marketing weeks run from Friday through Thursday and one reason for this week's big volume was large purchases of cattle Friday last week left over from the previous week's showlists, USDA marketing sources said. About 20,000 head were sold in the Panhandle area on that day and 35,000 in Kansas. Cattle sales on Fridays are typically light, sources said. --Bob Janis, 312-983-7347--
MCAT	Interbank rates were mostly unchanged on Monday with very few borrowers and lenders in the market, dealers said. Market liquidity had improved further following maturities of a 420-million ringgit long term government bond issue and a 500-million ringgit Bank Negara bills issue last week, but borrowing by some large banks, which were believed to be short of funds, had kept rates steady. "I don't see much movements over the next few days. There's no new Bank Negara bills issue or maturity this week," said a dealer with a Malaysian bank. One-week money was at 6.50/90 percent against 6.5/7.0 on Friday and three-week was unchanged at 7.10/20 percent. One-month money at 7.25/30 percent, three-month at 7.30/35 and six-month at 7.35/40, were all unchanged. Dealers said maturity of a 900-million ringgit long term government bond issue on May 15 could exert some pressure on rates again. "If the issue is not rolled over, rates may come off again," said another local bank dealer. There have been rumours that the central bank will announce a fresh Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) issue. The overnight interbank rate is expected to trade between 6.0 and 7.0 percent. It closed on Friday at 6.5 percent. The overnight rate shot up to 8.7 percent last Wednesday due to borrowing by big banks. Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were also steady. At 0300 GMT, the benchmark three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) December contract was unchanged at 92.66, or an implied yield of 7.34 percent. June and September were untraded. -- Syed Azman (603-206 2323) .
GCAT	U.S. special envoy Bill Richardson will fly to Paris on Wednesday to consult with France about the "endgame" in Zaire, as rebel forces approach the capital Kinshasa, a State Department spokesman said on Tuesday. Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has been shuttling between the Zaire factions and neighbouring countries trying to avert a bloody end to the Zaire conflict. He was in South Africa on Tuesday for talks with Vice President Thabo Mbeki. "We want to make sure we're coordinating with the French during the endgame in Zaire," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told Reuters. "It's only a matter of time. The writing's on the wall," said Burns, who was accompanying Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on a trip to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. The rebel forces of Laurent Kabila say they are less than 50 miles (85 km) from Kinshasa and have appealed for government troops to surrender to avoid a bloody takeover of the capital. Diplomatic sources say the front line is more like 125 miles (200 km) from Kinshasa. Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko, whose resignation the rebels have demanded, will travel to Gabon for an African mini summit on Wednesday but a spokesman said he would return to his capital two days later. U.S. officials say their differences with France over Zaire have narrowed in recent weeks as Paris has moved away from its long-standing support for Mobutu. Despite seizing the diplomatic initiative by sending Richardson to Zaire, Washington has appeared anxious to pay homage to France's traditional role in the region. France on Tuesday expressed deep concern over rebel threats to take Kinshasa by force if necessary and renewed its appeals for a peaceful transition.
ECAT	The Australian economy was mixed, with some areas including the manufacturing sector flat, Prime Minister John Howard told Perth radio. He had been asked about interest rates and whether the economy was weak.   "The economy is mixed. There are some areas that are flat, some areas of manufacturing are flat," Howard said. "Parts of the service industries are good; there are some signs of a housing and construction recovery but areas of manufacturing are flat and retailing, to say the least, is modest," he said.   Asked about the possibility of the Reserve Bank cutting interest rates following its monthly board meeting today, Howard said, "If the Senate passed our budget intact that would help the interest rate climate." "Having said all of that prime ministers always like to see low interest rates, but what happens with monetary policy is ultimately a matter for the Reserve Bank," he said. Asked about claims that the economy was weak and a rate cut was needed, Howard said: "The things that drive interes rate levels are myriad -- the level of inflation, the rate of wage increases, as well as activity and views about employment."   "They are all things that have to be taken into account and I don't think it probably helps the process of orderly decision making for me to be talking about what ought to happen with interest rates tomorrow," Howard said. On Monday, opposition Labor Treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said it was clear economic activity was very subdued and the Reserve Bank should cut interest rates immediately to kickstart jobs growth. Official cash rates were last cut by 50 basis points to 7.0 percent on July 31. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
ECAT	Investors have largely ignored the efforts to liberalise the economies of the 12-member Southern African Development Community (SADC), officials said on Wednesday. Now the trade group, struggling for a place in the global market, is looking beyond the recipes of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) for improvement. "Most SADC member states have implemented policies which according to the World Bank and the IMF are necessary for the positive contribution of foreign investment to economic development of the SADC countries," said Phakamani Radebe, Deputy Director of SADC's Finance and Investment Sector Coordination Unit (FISCU). "What we have now learned is that although liberalising our economies is essential, in itself it is not sufficient, and SADC countries need to build domestic and regional productive capacity as the basis for their own long-term development," he added. Radebe believes SADC needs to find out why the desired level of direct foreign investment has not been achieved. Fresh from preliminary discussions in advance of the 1997 SADC consultative conference, being held in the Namibian capital Windhoek, Radebe said most regional economies still suffered from lack of basic infrastructure and from a narrow production base. "The current environment in the SADC region is too weak to guarantee that the region will benefit from globalisation", he said. This year's conference, which formally starts on Thursday, will put a special emphasis on improving productivity. "Productivity levels and trends will be crucial in attracting foreign investment and enhancing the competitive edge of southern African companies", SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende said. SADC's finance and investment sector has conducted three studies to help lay the foundation for further development in the region. These include a study of macroeconomic policies in the region, the possibility of a regional bank or financial mechanism to close the funding gap when donor money dries up, and the promotion of investment in the region. Radebe said a study on the setting up of a regional bank would be completed in June. Abraham Pallanayo, director of SADC's trade and industry sector said the region also needed to expand trade among its own members as well as cross border investment. He said although the volume of trade among member countries had improved since South Africa joined SADC, more was needed towards establishing a free trade area within eight years. SADC countries signed a trade protocol last year which is aimed at establishing a regional free trade area in the next eight years. SADC comprises Mauritius, Angola, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Malawi, South Africa and Botswana.

GCAT	The United States has recalled its ambassador to Belarus for consultations and will soon announce further steps to protest the expulsion of a U.S. diplomat, the State Department said on Tuesday. Spokesman John Dinger said ambassador Kenneth Yalowitz would arrive in Washington Thursday to report to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. U.S. relations with Belarus have worsened sharply in recent weeks. Last week Washington said it had cut off $40 million in aid to the former Soviet Republic of 10 million people because of its human rights record. The latest flareup began when authorities in Minsk arrested U.S. first secretary Serzh Alexandrov, of Belarussian origin, at an opposition rally protesting against the pro-Moscow policies of hardline President Alexander Lukashenko. About 70 other people were arrested during the rally which erupted in clashes on Sunday. Alexandrov was detained several hours and told to leave within 24 hours. Belarus accused him of "provocative" actions. The embassy said he was carrying out his normal diplomatic duties. "We have recalled our ambassador from Minsk. He is expected to arrive back in Washington on Thursday for consulations," Dinger said. "Beyond that, there will be an appropriate response to the expulsion of Mr. Alexandrov which we hope to announce soon and we are still considering the full range of possibilities." He said the expulsion of Alexandrov was just the latest in a series of actions by Belarus against U.S. citizens. The United States has been a vociferous opponent of Lukashenko's increasingly authoritarian rule.
ECAT	The Monterrey National Chamber of Commerce (Canaco) on Tuesday came out against possible tax hikes during the next fiscal year. "We will not accept any increases in taxes, or in wages," Canaco president Jose Mario Garza Benavides told reporters. "Over the last ten years, it has been business and workers that have made the sacrifices," he said. Garza said that the Monterrey Canaco will make proposals for the national Confederation of Chambers of Commerce in order to defend its stance with the government. The proposals include tax breaks on fixed assets for businesses, Garza said. Workers would meanwhile need to have tax breaks extended from four times to ten times the minimum wage in order to offset losses in purchasing power, which Garza estimated at 28 percent over the past 21 months. -- Debora Montesinos, Monterrey newsroom, +528 345-7677

MCAT	Wall Street stocks were seen holding steady with a mild upward bias at the market open on Thursday, but investors were expected to be cautious ahead of tomorrow's key U.S. unemployment data, analysts said. The stock market could get an initial lift from short-covering and as bargain hunters searched for buying opportunities among technology sector, recently battered by several profit warnings, one analyst said. But trading could then settle, with markets unsure what unemployment data would mean for U.S. interest rates.   "The market remains somewhat cautious although it looks like we're set for a slightly higher opening," Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments said. "The highlight will be tomorrow's unemployment report." U.S. nonfarm payrolls, which were due out at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT on Friday, were expected to be up 219,000 in May versus a previous 142,000 rise. The unemployment rate was expected to be five percent in May compared to a previous 4.9 percent. Stronger-than-expected data could give new life to lurking fears that the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates in order to keep inflation at bay, analysts said.   "It could be a rocky session tomorrow but today we will be in a cautious trading range," Cardillo said. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was off 2/32 at a 6.89 percent yield and the Standard & Poor's 500 futures index was up 1.55 points at 843.65. On Wednesday, the Dow industrials finished down 42.49 points at 7269.66. The Nasdaq composite was hurt by pressure on technology issues and ended down 5.24 points at 1379.67. Analysts said bargain hunting could boost technology shares on Thursday, but the sector remained sensitive to all company and industry commentary during the session.   "Right now, techs look like they are leaning higher," Larry Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential Securities said. "After that, it will depend on commentary and trends during the day." On Thursday, the stock market was hit by worries that personal computer makers were suffering from declining demand and would issue profit warnings. Japan's Nikkei-225 index finished off 123.41 points at 20488.15. In London, the FTSE 100 was up 1.9 points at 4559. U.S. stocks were steady there as many European investors stayed on the sidelines before U.S. unemployment data.   The dollar slipped against the yen in Tokyo, trading at 115.87/92 yen. In Europe, the dollar at 1.7285/95 marks. The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column said troubles at U.S. retailer Kmart Corp might not be over, according to some analysts. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report May same-store sales grew as little as 2.5 percent, well below its plan of four to six percent. The New York Times said in its Market Place column that while Microsoft Corp executives have cautioned that the company's growth could slow and that multiples were too high, the share price remains strong.

MCAT	Hong Kong shares edged lower in quiet London trading on Thursday, amid profit-taking and concerns about recent speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar and other regional currencies, dealers said. The Hang Seng London Reference index fell 50.83 points or 0.3 percent to 15,658.40, after the Hang Seng fell 29.58 or 0.2 percent to 15,709.23 after initially reaching a record 15,880.57. Dealers said attention on Friday would likely focus on a meeting of Asian central bankers in Shanghai to discuss the region's currency woes. "Everyone is waiting for the central banks meeting," said one dealer, "people want to hear what Japan has to say and tomorrow is D-Day." The dealer said Hong Kong could not be completely insulated from the turmoil gripping currencies in the region and noted that it had already nudged up lending rates to help deter speculative selling of the currency. Elsewhere the market was quiet with prices pulled lower by a weak start on Wall Street. "There is nothing spectacular, we are just following the Street lower...it is just another quiet day in London," said another dealer. -- David Holmes, London Newsroom +44 171 542 4367
GCAT	The Oakland school board, responding to a storm of criticism, voted Wednesday to alter parts of a plan that recognised black English or Ebonics as a distinct language. After three hours of heated debate that ended just before midnight, the board unanimously approved an amended version of its December resolution that sparked national controversy. The new resolution removed references to Ebonics as "genetically based" and as the "primary language" of many African-American students. The board also deleted part of the resolution that -- despite the board's denials -- was widely taken to mean that it wanted African-American students to be taught in Ebonics. The new resolution said studies had shown that African Language Systems had origins in West and Niger-Congo languages and were "not merely dialects of English." The board recognised the existence of black English and said "these are language patterns that many African-American students bring to school." It urged school officials to draw up an academic programme to help students master English "while respecting and embracing the legitimacy and richness" of Ebonics. Board president Jean Quan said implementing the policy would be "the real hard work." "Wordsmithing the resolution is not going to really make that much difference," she said. Later, she told reporters that the changes in the wording did not alter the intent of the resolution. Ebonics, derived from "ebony" and "phonics," describes speech patterns used by some African Americans. Opinions differ as to whether it is a language, a dialect or slang. The Oakland school district is the only one in California where black students are in the majority. During a heated 90-minute public comment period, some speakers criticised the board for changing the resolution while others opposed it in any form. Quan repeatedly appealed to the noisy crowd to allow people to speak and once threatened to cut short the meeting. Robert Moody, a member of a group called Africans United for Self Help, opposed changing the original resolution, saying: "We need to stand on our own two feet ... I defy anyone of another race to tell us how to speak." "America, you've got to wake up. You can't tell us what to do," he said. Deborah Wright, who said she was a former candidate for Congress, attacked the board's efforts. "Your policy that attempts to legitimise poor grammar and identify it with black America will set us back 100 years," she said. Ann Johnson, assistant principal of Franklin elementary school in Oakland, supported the amended resolution, saying Ebonics was an effective classroom tool. "It is a sound initiative," she said. Some black leaders, local officials and the Clinton administration sharply criticised Oakland's original resolution, adopted by the board on Dec. 18. Oakland school officials insisted all along that the policy had been misunderstood and they would not teach Ebonics in place of standard English. By recognising Ebonics, they said they hoped to improve the way black students are taught to read and write standard English.

Vietnam News Agency said in a brief despatch that the decline in the deficit could be attributed to government measures such as controlling inflation, promoting exports and limiting imports.
MCAT	U.S. Treasuries extended gains in late afternoon trade on continued buying after the release of a lower-than-expected Employment Cost Index (ECI) triggered a strong rally, analysts said. By 1450 EST/1950 GMT, the 6-3/4 percent 30-year benchmark Treasury bond was quoted up 1-26/32 at 100-22/32. Its yield dropped to 6.70 percent, the lowest level since the August 12 close.   The Employment Cost Index released on Tuesday posted a 0.6 percent rise against an expected 0.8 percent jump. The report suggested inflation pressures remain mostly tame, bolstering the view that the Federal Reserve might keep interest rates unchanged at its November 13 meeting. "The market got the news it was hoping for," said Kevin Flanagan, economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc, referring to the market-friendly ECI report. A drop in consumer confidence to 106.2 in October from 111.8 in September also provided underpinning. -- Jose Paulo Vicente, 212-869-1676
MCAT	Cocoa futures eased further after Friday's losses to end Monday midsession lower but trading was extremely slow traders said. Traders said there could be some fund selling earlier on. "But volume was not sufficient to put a hand on anything today," said one trader. Further sterling's advance against the German mark could have weighed down on sentiment, traders said. Benchmark September stood 13 stg lower at 1,027 stg a tonne after gapping 10 stg down and well below pre-opening expectations of two or three stg down. It touched an intraday-low of 1,026 stg, the lowest level since July 8. After the immediate floor at 1,024, the contract faces a key support at 1,000. But the upside potential seemed limited. Traders said with New York testing the $1,525-$1,550 area basis September amid negative chart signals, London could be looking at the 1,020 stg region soon. Sterling/mark hit 3.0258, the highest since October 1990 on Monday, amid broad mark weakness before trading nearly 1/2 pfenning lower by midday in London. Sterling's jump also came at the back of persistent expectations of higher UK interest rates. With little supply/demand fundamental inputs, traders said the outlook for the cocoa futures hinged on the direction of the sterling. Volume reached a paltry 793 lots, centred on September contract. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985

GCAT	Some 800 people have been evacuated as a precautionary measure from homes in eastern Cuba as heavy rains lashed most of the island, official media said on Thursday. The bad weather, which began at the weekend and was expected to continue at least for the next 24 hours, followed extensive damage to crops last month when Hurricane Lili hit western and central areas of the country. The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said 800 people were evacuated from low-lying areas of eastern Holguin province, most of them from the town of Sagua de Tanamo. Six houses collapsed in Baracoa, in Guantanamo provice, after constant rain for the last few days, the agency said. While the worst of the weather hit eastern provinces, Havana was also lashed by rain and wind. There have been numerous power cuts in the capital in the past three days, apparently because of fallen electricity cables and transformers.
MCAT	The foreign crude market in the key U.S. Gulf Coast refining center was subdued on Monday amid a UK bank holiday, traders said. With benchmark Brent crude out of action, buyers and sellers were reluctant to engage in serious negotiations, traders said. Delivered Brent on the Gulf Coast was assessed notionally around 70-75 cents under West Texas Intermediate/Cushing. Among other North Sea grades, a Norwegian Oseberg for mid-May arrival was available around WTI/Cushing minus 75 cents a barrel on a delivered basis. A cargo each of Heidrun and Troll were also looking for homes at discounts of $1.50-70 and 60 cents, respectively, for June 1-5 delivery. In Latin America, attention was focused on Colombian state Ecopetrol's awarding of two early June cargoes of Cusiana to two separate U.S. refiners late on Friday, trade sources said. The refiners paid a discount of between $1.20 and $1.40 a barrel to WTI/Cushing on an fob basis, a price that was higher than market expectations partly as a result of softened Caribbean freight rates. The cargoes load on June 3-7 and June 5-9. Traders were closely watching this tender to set the tone for six other Cusiana cargoes loading in June. An equity producer had the next Cusiana loading June 7-11, traders said. --Patricia Garip-Bertuol NY Energy Desk ((+1 212 859 1620))

ECAT	Ukraine's central bank cut its key refinancing rate to 18 percent from 21 percent, effective today, the bank's press secretary Dmitry Rikberg told a news conference. The central bank last cut the rate on May 26 to 21 percent from 25 percent. Early last year the rate was 105 percent.   Central bank chief Viktor Yushchenko told journalists late last month that the bank would cut the rate in early July if forecasts that inflation would ease came true. The statistics ministry says monthly inflation fell to 0.1 percent last month from 0.8 percent the previous month. Inflation stood at 5.3 percent in the first six months of this year and 39.7 percent for the whole of last year. --Natalya Zinets, Kiev newsroom 38 044 244 9154
GCAT	Ex-Formula One drivers Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson, along with Danish co-driver Tom Kristensen, held a narrow lead after the first hour of the Le Mans 24 Hours race on Saturday. Less than 40 seconds separated the leading ten cars but Albereto, driving the Porsche-Joest prototype which started in pole position, recorded the fastest lap with a time of three minutes 48.386 seconds at an average speed of 214 kph. Alboreto, who broke the 13.6-km course record in qualifying on Friday, was being trailed by the Nissan R390 of Belgian Eric van de Poele, supported by another Italian former F1 driver in Riccardo Patrese and Aguri Suzuki of Japan. The factory Porsche 911, second on the grid and driven by Frenchman Bob Wollek with Le Mans veterans Hans Stuck of Germany and Thierry Boutsen of Belgium, was slightly less than half a minute behind in ninth place. But another works Porsche driven by former winner Yannick Dalmas of France -- with compatriot Emmanuel Collard and German Ralf Kellners -- was third, followed by the McLaren of 1995 winner JJ Lehto of Finland, Brazil's ex-F1 champion Nelson Piquet and Briton Steve Soper. Two of the 48 entries pulled out with mechanical problems in the first hour of the race which began (at 1400 GMT) under menacing skies. The weather forecast was for heavy showers during the night and fog in the early morning.
CCAT	CRA Ltd managing director Leigh Clifford said on Thursday that its deal to sell the Century zinc project to Pasminco Ltd would be off if talks with aboriginal groups could not be resolved. "In effect, if there was to be no lease issued (under native title provisions) the deal does not get completed," Clifford told reporters after RTZ-CRA announced Pasminco's plan to pay A$345 million for the Queensland zinc project.   The issue of the mining lease is dependent on the successful outcome of talks with indigenous groups who claim ownership of the land under the national government's native title provisions. There is no clear time-frame for an outcome of the talks but the Century project is scheduled to begin production in mid-1998. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

ECAT	Former Federal Reserve Board Governor and consummate inflation hawk Wayne Angell said the U.S. central bank will likely keep interest rates steady as inflation is not expected to accelerate. Speaking to the U.S. cable television network CNBC, Angell said, "I think it would be prudent to raise rates if we get some signal that the Federal Reserve is providing excess liquidity, and that wouldn't show up in the stock market; that would show up in the commodity market ... I'm not looking for that to happen this year."   Angell, chief economist at Bear, Stearns and Co Inc, said the case for a Fed tightening now is not as strong as it was in July of last year. "In July, they (Fed policymakers) were expecting 2.25 percent growth and we ended up with 3.25 percent growth, and now they're expecting 2.25 percent growth and (they) are suggesting maybe rates should go higher," Angell said. The Bear, Stearns economist said Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was "talking tough" earlier Wednesday during the first leg of his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins address before Congress, adding that he does not expect the Fed Chairman to hike rates at its next policy confab on March 25. Angell said commodity prices are "fairly well behaved," and that with no run-up in oil or food prices, the Fed should stand pat on rates. "... I just do not believe that when they come to the March meeting that they'll be raising rates, so I think he's talking tough because he's not going to act," Angell said. (( -- N.A.

CCAT	Taiwan's Formosa Chemical & Fibre Corp said on Thursday it would issue T$4 billion in seven-year unsecured corporate bonds to help finance its parent Formosa Group's US$9 billion naphtha cracker project. "We will issue the bonds in the near term, probably in November, to help finance our sixth naphtha cracker project," a company director Lee Hsien-ning told Reuters. The bonds would bear a coupon rate of about 6.54 percent, he added. Formosa Plastics Corp launched its US$9 billion sixth naphtha cracker project in 1993 in central Taiwan.   Construction of the complex, including a naphtha cracker and oil refinery, will take six years to complete.

MCAT	U.S. spot natural gas prices for May eroded below last week's levels Monday as ample storage supplies and seasonable weather weakened demand, industry sources said. May Louisiana Gulf Coast prices at the Henry Hub fell an average of six cents to $2.08-2.10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), still up about 25 cents from April indices. Meanwhile, prices at the hub for Tuesday delivery eased by more than 10 cents to about $2.08 as warmer-than-normal weather moved into the region and was expected to continue through week's end.   Similarly in south Texas, May prices lost about four cents to about $2.00-2.02. Incremental demand may escalate later in the week as some air-conditioning needs surface in western Texas, market sources said. In the Northeast, where normal to above-normal temperatures are expected most of this week, May New York city-gate prices were still talked in the $2.40s. Prices for Tuesday, which is forecast to be the coolest day of the week, were five to 10 cents softer at $2.35-2.40. Appalachian prices for next month were quoted at $2.32-2.36 on Columbia and $2.33-2.38 on CNG. At the Chicago city-gate, May gas traded mostly around $2.17, while prices for Tuesday fell about 10 cents to $2.10-2.13. Detroit city-gate prices were at $2.20-2.32 for May, market sources said. Elsewhere in the Midcontinent, May prices erased last week's gains to about $1.94-1.96, with Demarcation quoted mostly in the low-to-mid $1.90s. April prices in the Midcontinent were for the most part in convergence with May in the low-to-mid $1.90s. Further west, Permian basin prices for May 1 slid five cents to $1.83-1.89, still holding about a 25-cent premium to April 1. San Juan gas traded in the low-to-mid $1.80s. Swing Permian prices were talked in the mid-to-high $1.80s, about even with May baseload. At the southern California border, May prices were talked about five cents lower at $1.95-2.00. Warmer-than-normal temperatures are expected to blanket the Southwest through the week, Weather Services Corp said. ((--H McCulloch, New York Power Desk +212-859-1628))
GCAT	In a show of support, Argentine President Carlos Menem on Tuesday flew his cabinet for their weekly meeting to a town in the Patagonian Andes that has been struck by the lethal Hanta virus. "Solidarity is not shown by words but by deeds, that's why we've come here to work and find solutions for these people," the Peronist leader said in a speech upon his arrival in El Bolson, an idyllic town in the foothills of the Andes. Ten people have died around Bolson and the nearby ski resort of Bariloche in the latest outbreak of Hanta virus, a lethal disease spread by mouse and rat droppings which causes kidney failure and has a high death rate. With farmers and tourism operators complaining that the local economy was being ruined by spreading fear of the virus, Menem said he had come "to show the truth about a load of stories that have nothing to do with scientific opinion." Two U.S. infection experts, Brian Hjelle and Steve Simpson of the University of New Mexico, arrived in Bariloche last week to help local officials combat the spread of the virus. Hjelle called Hanta "a really strange virus" and said the strain found in Argentina was very different from the strain isolated in the United States. There have been cases of Hanta virus reported in Argentine towns as far apart as Oran, in the extreme north, and Rosario, just northwest of Buenos Aires. Argentine scientist Daniel Stamboulian said a vaccine would be easy to develop, but laboratories were unlikely to spend resources on such a rare disease. "The problem with the vaccine is that technically it is possible, but since it would be a vaccine for small towns, no laboratory or company is going to study it," he said. Viral specialists say Hanta cannot be spread by rats in cities. The virus was first isolated during the Korean War near the Hantaan river, from which it gets its name.

ECAT	An Organisation of African Unity trade fair planned for Nigeria in November has been postponed until March 1997, a government minister said on Tuesday. "The venue and date of the fair had to be changed for logistic reasons," Rear Admiral Jubrila Ayinla, minister of commerce and tourism, told reporters. Ayinla said the fair had been moved from Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub, to the northern city of Kaduna because facilities in Lagos were sub-standard. The fair is due to last from March 29 to April 6. At least 350 million naira ($4.38 million) are to be spent upgrading Kaduna's trade fair complex and international airport. The fair, held every four years, aims to increase trade between African countries, as well as encouraging outside business. The last was held in Zimbabwe in 1992. ($1=80 naira)

MCAT	Tokyo rubber futures ended higher on Monday, helped by the yen's weaker tendency against the dollar, traders said. Prices ranged from 0.4 yen to 1.7 yen per kg higher. Benchmark August was up 0.9 yen at 156.0 yen. Activity was thin as private investors were tending to put money into more volatile commodity futures such as grain, after closing positions in rubber futures. The market opened firmer on short-covering. "The market was basically directionless. Weak physical demand in producing countries may put a lid on prices," one trader said.
GCAT	Bosnians supporting opposition politicians in the northwest of the country around Bihac are so frightened of reprisals they may not vote in upcoming elections, a U.N. spokesman said on Wednesday. "U.N. monitors... believe that this intimidation may continue up to the elections," U.N. spokesman Alex Ivanko told reporters in Sarajevo. "It will have dire consequences for the whole election process because people that support opposition parties will prefer, for security reasons, not to exercise their right to vote." U.N. police operating in the Moslem-controlled Bihac area reported eight explosions there in the past week, all of them directed at people supporting candidates or parties in opposition to the ruling Moslem nationalist SDA party. "If the local authorities in Bihac are interested in having free and fair elections they only have weeks, if not days, to get their act together, although their committments are doubtful right now," Ivanko said. Active harassment and intimidation of the political opposition in the Bihac area began in June when an SDA loyalist struck Bosnia's former Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on the head with an iron pipe. Silajdzic resigned his government position and broke with the SDA in January, forming his own party to run in opposition to the SDA for a seat on Bosnia's collective Presidency. Ivanko said U.N. monitors in the Bihac area had received a letter from one of the local opposition parties accusing nine police officers and eight SDA supporters of intimidation. Last week, U.N. police Commissioner Peter Fitzgerald met interior ministers from Bosnia's Moslem-Croat federation and its Serb republic who agreed to instruct local police to support free and fair elections. "They (the interior ministers) either failed to issue these orders, which is possible, or there was some bogus communication breakdown throughout the country, which I think is not very much possible," Ivanko said. Ivanko said commissioner Fitzgerald would contact local police directly to get his message across even though "we have some unconfirmed reports that people are being intimidated by local policemen". Political intimidation also took place in Serb-controlled Teslic earlier in the week. Ivanko reported that a factory director was forced from his job on Monday because of his opposition to the ruling Serb nationalist SDS party. He was the second factory manager in Teslic to be replaced in the past week -- both by SDS supporters.
MCAT	The state-run Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) said on Saturday it had invited bids by June 7 for the import of 25,000 tonnes of white refined crystal sugar for delivery at Karachi port or nearby Port Qasim by July 31.   The TCP said it would also accept bids received by June 7 to supply the same quantity of sugar for delivery by August 15, but an official said this was an alternative delivery date and the corporation would buy a total of only 25,000 tonnes. The TCP bought 25,000 tonnes of sugar at $334.34 per tonne C&F last week after its May 11 tender for 50,000 tonnes. The Pakistan Sugar Mills Association says domestic sugar output reached 2.367 million tonnes by April 30 compared to 2.439 million tonnes at the same time a year ago. -- Karachi newsroom 9221-5685192
GCAT	Separatist Tamil Tiger rebels launched a fierce attack on Sri Lankan troops advancing north along one flank as part of a major thrust into rebel territory on Thursday, military officials said. Troops which advanced from the northern frontline town of Puvarasankulam met stiff resistance from Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at Kuruvikulam, west of the government-held town of Vavuniya, on Thursday morning, they said. A military official said at least 12 rebels were killed and more were believed wounded in the Kuruvikulam battle. The number of army casualties was uncertain, he added. Meanwhile, soldiers which had advanced on another flank to capture the rebel-held town of Omanthai on Wednesday, were consolidating, the Defence Ministry said on Thursday. Troops, backed by artillery, tanks and helicopter gunships, broke out of their bases in Vavuniya, 220 km (135 miles) north of the capital Colombo on Tuesday, launching an offensive code-named "Jaya Sikuru", or "Sure of Victory", into the rebel-held northern Wanni heartland. LTTE transmissions monitored by the army said at least 100 rebels had been killed or wounded in the battle for Omanthai, a Defence Ministry spokesman said. He said army casualties in Omanthai and elsewhere stood at 18 dead and 31 wounded in the three-day-old offensive. LTTE rebels are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in predominantly Sinhalese Sri Lanka's north and east. The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the war, now in its 14th year. The LTTE says the toll is higher. Analysts said the aim of the fresh offensive was to open a land supply route linking Vavuniya with the Jaffna peninsula, about 100 km (60 miles) further north. Vavuniya lies 220 km (135 miles) north of the capital Colombo. The military has been tight-lipped about where the troops were heading. But the LTTE's international spokesman in London accused the military of killing Tamil civilians and destroying their properties under the guise of opening up a supply route. "Army artillery has been raining down on Tamil civilians and on their homes and in most cases they were nowhere near the supply route the army wants to open," Anton Raja told Reuters by telephone. He said droves of civilians have begun to abandon their homes and seek shelter in mosquito-infested jungles. "The Chandrika (Kumaratunga) government is blatantly violating a plea by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to protect civilians in war," Raja said. The ICRC earlier this month appealed to the government and rebels to spare civilians and respect humanitarian law during times of war. Military officials said LTTE positions in the Wanni region came under heavy attack on Thursday when the army fired shells from bases at Welioya, Kilinochchi and Elephant Pass in the north, officials said. An international aid worker in Vavuniya told Reuters at least 10 civilians were killed and more had been wounded from the artillery shelling of Wanni. But other aid workers said they had not seen large scale civilian movement as during previous offensives. A large number of civilians, anticipating the offensive, had already moved to safer locations, they said.
CCAT	The collapse of Barings last year has exposed the weakness of the Bank of England in supervising banks that are rapidly expanding into volatile international security markets, a member of parliament's Treasury Select Committee said on Tuesday. Conservative MP Tim Yeo avoided direct comment on a report the panel will publish on Wednesday into the collapse of Britain's oldest merchant bank under the weight of more than $1 billion in losses chalked up by Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson. But the MP told BBC radio it was clear from the evidence that the all-party committee heard that the central bank's traditional supervisory activity was now "rather stretched" by banks' growing concentration on securities markets. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that the Treasury committee would conclude that there may be a case for an independent banking supervisor. It said there may be a conflict of interest between the Bank of England's ambition to make London the most competitive financial market in the world and its supervisory role. Yeo said the Bank of England's primary duties were to protect the currency and the stability of the financial system. "These are duties which don't lead them directly always to look out for malpractice within any individual bank," he said. Yeo said the Barings affair had also exposed "the difficulty of regulating activities which take place in other markets, and the lack of communication between regulators in one country and another". Britain's banking regulator, he said, should have the necessary powers to liaise with its overseas counterparts. "It would need to be effective at international liaison and be able to pull together all the different activities of the banks, not just lending, but also operating in derivatives markets and a variety of other markets as well. "It needs to be a multi-function regulator. It would have a big job to do. That is why the report is not unduly critical of the Bank of England, because it recognises the difficulties which have been created by the changing activities of banks themselves," Yeo said. The Bank of England said it could not comment as it had not yet seen the committee's report. -- London newsroom 44-171-542 7767
CCAT	French defence firm Thomson-CSF, which the government has decided to sell privately after a bungled privatisation attempt last year, called on Wednesday for its sale to go ahead as fast as possible . "The management of Thomson-CSF takes note of this decision and is pleased that it answers some essential concerns of Thomson-CSF," a company spokesman said after the government announced the sale plan on Wednesday.. "We hope the timetable for the sale will be as short as possible because the world is moving around us," he said, referring to defence sector restructuring already taking place in the United States and Europe. Thomson-CSF, fearing it might be swallowed up in a larger grouping by the privatisation, had lobbied for a public flotation. But this attitude changed after the government announced it would sell Thomson-CSF by private placement and issued terms and conditions. Thomson-CSF said it welcomed the plan for it to become a world-scale defence electronics company, while keeping a "golden share" in state hands. The government said in a statement it was seeking to bring together many industrial capabilities around Thomson-CSF as part of the restructuring of the European defence industry. The decision to keep a golden share would allow it to "protect national defence interests and avoid any dismantling of the company", the statement said. The government is relaunching the privatisation of Thomson-CSF, which is 58 percent held by state-owned Thomson SA group, after cancelling its previous plan to sell the entire group in December. The government had previously expressed a preference for a bid by Lagardere for the Thomson group over a rival bid by Alcatel Alsthom. Alcatel has since acted to reinforce its position since last year by lining up a joint bid with state-owned aircraft and defence firm Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation for Thomson-CSF. The Thomson-CSF spokesman said the company was pleased that employees would have access to its shares under terms similar to those available if it had been privatised through a public share offer. Ten percent of shares sold are to be reserved for employees of Thomson and its subsidiaries. Thomson-CSF also applauded a government commitment to associate the company closely with all stages of the sale. Thomson-CSF shares climbed on the government announcement, trading by late morning up 4.56 percent at 183.5 francs ($32.10), the highest level this year, even though the blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 0.05 percent. Traders said the government's decision to sell the company by private placement should lead to a better share valuation. "The privatisation will go ahead through a private placement, quickly, and, no doubt, at a better price than through a public offering, a fund manager said. "A public offering would have scattered the capital, whereas here, they are selling control of the company and that has a cost." Traders also said Thomson shares were benefiting simply from the fact there had been an announcement. "The government has finally given its opinion and traders are reassessing the project," a trader said. -- Paris Newsroom +331 4221 545 ($ = 5.718 French Francs)

CCAT	Barclays Plc shares slid lower on Tuesday after the bank announced 1996 pretax profits at the lower end of market expectations, including a slump in its investment banking unit BZW. The shares were quoted 25p lower at 1174.5p at 1150 GMT, having hit a low of 1131p, after news that pretax profits rose by 13 percent to 2.36 billion pounds ($3.82 billion), including an exceptional 70 million pounds gain on disposals. This was at the low end of analysts' forecasts and included a 29 percent fall in operating profits at BZW to 204 million pounds. The group, which has already performed more than one billion pounds of share repurchases in the last 18 months, said it would return 500 million pounds to shareholders in the next 12 months and raised its dividend by 21 percent to 31.5 pence, in line with forecasts. Chief executive Martin Taylor mounted a spirited defence of the results and his strategy at BZW, saying that the British banking figures were "cracking" and that Barclays was investing for the future at the investment bank. "You have to be careful not to be frightened by your own shadow," Taylor told Reuters in an interview. "The reason that the returns are depressed (at BZW) this year is that we're spending so much." Taylor said that if Barclays had invested less in BZW, the unit's profits would have been higher, but that without the investment, BZW would be a weaker firm. In a statement earlier, Barclays reported underperformance by BZW in the fixed income market, with the exception of sterling, and in foreign exchange, in which said it had performed poorly in an increasingly competitive market. Taylor said BZW would continue to incur quite high costs in the first half of the current year and would then face the disruption of moving its offices to Canary Wharf in London's Docklands. "I would hope that the second half would be a lot better," he added. BZW has had a turbulent time in the past year, which started with the death of its chief executive, David Band, and has included high-level management shake-ups. It has also been involved in what have been perceived as some high-profile problems with clients. The biggest of these was its takeover defence for Northern Electric against U.S. energy group CE Electric, which is being investigated by Britain's Takeover Panel. The late disclosure by BZW of a 250,000 stg discretionary fee clause meant that CE's offer was extended and it captured Northern by the slimmest of margins. But Taylor said that well-publicised events last year, such as the Northern Electric defence, had not done BZW damage. "I think Northern Electric showed BZW behaving very energetically to try and prevent a client being taken over and almost succeeding," Taylor said. "We very nearly saved it." On the share price reaction, one broker's head of equity sales said, "The results were very disappointing and there will be some downgrades as a result. "The trials and tribulations at the investment banking arm look as if they will probably be continuing into the next year," he said. Taylor said Barclays was looking for the best way to return the bank's excess capital to shareholders but rejected the idea of a special dividend, saying that share repurchases help non-sellers to concentrate their position. He noted that earnings per share had risen by 25 percent to 104.2p. Taylor also rejected the notion that Barclays was devoid of ideas because it wanted to return capital. He said the bank would make acquisitions if they added to shareholder value but could see none on the horizon at present. "We're already growing very quickly right across our personal sector business," Taylor said. "Both the personal bank and the business bank have had a cracking year."
GCAT	Kiwi Frank Nobilo successfully defended a title for the first time in his impressive career when he won the $1.9 million Sarazen World Open by four strokes Sunday. Nobilo began the final round four strokes behind Scott Hoch, but he was on the good end of an eight-shot swing as he reeled off six birdies in a bogey-free six-under-par 66 in crisp, cool conditions at Chateau Elan. "My focus was brilliant," said Nobilo, who finished at 16-under 272. He received $342,000, as well as a trophy from tournament host Gene Sarazen, one of golf's all-time greats.
CCAT	Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc said Friday that Oclassen stockholders approved the merger of Watson and Oclassen Pharmaceuticals The transaction was completted February 27, through the issuance of 3,857,000 shares of Watson Pharmaceuticals common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of Oclassen and rights to acquire capital stock of Oclassen, and will be accounted for as a "pooling of interests" and a tax-free reorganization.  Going forward, Oclassen will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Watson.
CCAT	Baldwin Piano & Organ Co said on Wednesday its board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan to assure that shareholders are treated fairly if there is a takeover attempt. The board set a dividend distribution on September 10, 1996, of one common share purchase right for each outstanding share of Baldwin's common stock, the company said. The rights have a ten year life, and may be exercised if a party acquires 15 percent or more of Baldwin's common stock, or announces a tender offer to do so, without the consent of the Baldwin's board, the company said.
MCAT	New Zealand Minister of Finance Bill Birch said on Monday he expected the New Zealand dollar to fall further towards the end of 1997. Asked if he would be concerned if the New Zealand dollar fell any further, Birch told Reuters in an interview: "I expect we will see it come down. They (the Reserve Bank of New Zealand) are foreshadowing further easings towards the end of this year so you are likely to get a little more easing."   Birch said he was more comfortable with where the currency was today than where it was last week. The New Zealand dollar has fallen sharply in recent weeks after a period in which it has been perceived as over-valued. "From the point of view of the mix between interest rates and exchange rates the rebalancing has been very positive, I think, in terms of long term growth," he said. Birch said he believed an export-led recovery would give New Zealand a much longer growth cycle and that if rates were too low it could cause a speculative burst of investment which would put pressure on the economy.   "You don't want interest rates so low that you are going to cause a burst of investment that might be speculative or drive up tradesmens' wages as house prices rise. That caused quite a lot of pressure on our economy last time round," he said. Birch said he believed New Zealand exporters were in a strong position to bounce back quickly after the recent fall in the currency. "They (exporters) have actually been through a couple of years of pretty hard times and they've maintained thier export levels. They've captured efficiencies during that period," Birch said.   Birch earlier told a Trans-Tasman Business Circle luncheon that the New Zealand government would place an increased emphasis on improving access for its exporters to international markets. Birch said he had spoken with Australian Treasurer, Peter Costello about Trans-Tasman taxation and approval required on investment between Australia and New Zealand. "Most Australian businesses would say they were confident of getting approval to invest in New Zealand, or the other way around, but there is a pretty big cost in the delay for those approvals," Birch said.   The next step to improve this process was to discuss possible changes in the present arrangements with business, Birch said. -- Michael Stapleton, Melbourne Bureau 61-3 9286-1435
GCAT	A bomb blast killed a seven-year-old girl and her mother in a community near Srinagar, the summer capital of India's troubled Jammu and Kashmir state, police said on Saturday. At least eight Indian soldiers were injured in the explosion which occurred late on Friday, they said. The bomb, planted in a scooter by separatist guerrillas, wrecked a passing army vehicle in Elahi Bagh area of Bachepora, 12 km (7.5 miles) northeast of Srinagar, police said. The bomb had been detonated by remote control, they added. Harkat-ul-Ansar, an Islamic militant group, claimed responsibility for the blast. "Our Mujahideen in a bomb attack near Bachepora completely destroyed an Indian army vehicle killing all on board," a Harkat-ul-Ansar statement in Urdu and delivered to local newspaper offices in Srinagar on Saturday said. India says Harkat-ul-Ansar is linked to the shadowy Al-Faran group which kidnapped four Western tourists as hostages on July 4, 1995. Harkat-ul-Ansar denies the charge. Harkat said that the girl and her mother were killed in retaliatory fire by Indian soldiers after the blast. Residents of the area said that scores of houses were ransacked by Indian solidiers and two of them were set on fire after the bomb attack. Witnesses said Indian troops fired in the air and beat up local residents. More than a dozen militant groups in Kashmir are fighting for independence from India or for closer ties with neighbouring Pakistan. Police and hospitals say more than 20,000 people have been killed in a six-year-old rebellion in the Himalyan region, which broke out in January 1990. A new government led by chief minister Farooq Abdullah's National Conference party assumed office on Wednesday after local polls held last month gave them sweeping majority in the state assembly.
ECAT	Queensland and New South Wales, the third and first most populous states, are leading the Australian economy, according to trend data issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday. Queensland's gross state product grew at a trend quarterly rate of 1.1 percent in constant price terms in the December quarter. New South Wales' grew 0.9 percent in the quarter. The national economy, measured by a different methodology, grew at a 0.4 percent or 0.6 percent trend rate in the same period, depending on the measure chosen.   The other three main states showed similar trend growth rates: 0.7 percent in Victoria and 0.6 percent in South Australia and Western Australia. heavily driven by resource developments, has vied with Queensland as the fastest-growing state. The trend data, moving averages that iron out bumps in the highly volatile seasonally adjusted series, is subject to revision. Further, the bureau warns that its constant-price measure is only experimental.
MCAT	CBOT soyoil futures ended firmer but off the day's highs as funds bought at least 2,000 lots, traders said. Soymeal futures closed mixed with nearbys down on fund long liquidation ahead of first notice day Friday. "We just crushed the March/May spread," one trader said, referring to soymeal. "Funds were getting out of the March." Traders said they did not expect any deliveries to be posted against the March soymeal contract but soyoil deliveries were expected to be heavy. Floor sources estimated at least 2,000 lots would be posted for delivery Friday. "The cash basis is 1.50 (cent per lb) under the March. Why wouldn't you deliver?" one floor source said. Meanwhile, cash soymeal prices remained strong with prices at Decatur, Ill., quoted at $7 over March futures on Thursday, cash sources said. On the day, Smith Barney and Rosenthal Collins each bought 800 lots May soyoil and E.D. and F. Man International bought 600 lots May, traders said. Soymeal closed $3.70 per ton higher to $0.60 lower with March down $0.60 at $255.60 a ton. Soyoil closed 0.35 to 0.11 cent per lb higher with March up 0.11 at 24.00 cents.

MCAT	Shanghai soybean futures ended mostly up in slow trading on Thursday on speculative buying from retail investors, traders said. The key January 1997 contract did not trade, with both long and short position holders having liquidated all their positions on Wednesday. The March contract rose two yuan to 3,142 yuan per tonne, May rose eight yuan to 3,188, July rose one to 3,251, November climbed three to 3,368, and September fell 10 to 3,278.   Combined volume fell to 9,200 tonnes from 33,200 on Wednesday. Traders said the market trend changed little despite today's gains. "Retail investors dominated today's trading, but that didn't change the mood of uncertainty over the short-term market trend," one trader said. "Most investors are liquidating their positions gradually with the approach of the Chinese new year holiday." Analysts expected soybeans to continue moving in a narrow range in the short term.

CCAT	Robust Asian copper demand will form the backbone of sales for Chilean mining giant Codelco over the next few years, the general manager of its second biggest mine said on Tuesday. "For all of our business, Asia is our future," Fernando Riveri, general manager of Codelco's El Teniente mine, told reporters at a briefing. He was in Singapore for the signing of a copper smelter agreement with a Thai company.   The Chilean company will help operate the smelter in a deal worth US$50 million over the next three years, Riveri said. The Codelco official said production in El Teniente, second only in size to the massive Chuquicamata open pit mine, should reach 350,000 tonnes for calendar 1996. Output at El Teniente in the first nine months of the year reached only 252,600 tonnes against 238,000 tonnes in the same period last year. Total production last year at El Teniente reached 322,000 tonnes and Codelco had earlier forecast that output in 1996 will range between 342,000-360,000 tonnes.   Codelco's total production for 1996 is expected to touch 1.5 million tonnes. The company is pursuing three projects in Asia on which it hopes to conclude an agreement in the first half of 1997, Riveri said, declining to elaborate on the companies or countries involved. Codelco will sign on Wednesday an agreement to provide technical expertise in the startup of the Rayong copper smelter of Thai Copper Industries Ltd.   "We are very sure of 350,000 tonnes this year. We hope to produce 350,0000 tonnes in 1997," he said. "We don't have any problems for November and December." He forecast that copper prices in 1997 will range between $0.90 to $0.95 a lb, although he would prefer $1.00 a lb. Asked if the price next year is adequate for Codelco, he said: "Ninety-five cents is a good price for us." -- Singapore Newsroom (65-8703305)
ECAT	Britain's trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed sharply in October as exports were snapped up, the government said Tuesday. Britain's trade deficit was pared to 454 million pounds ($760.1 million) in October from 1,059 million pounds ($1.5 billion) in September, the Office for National Statistics said. But more up-to-date figures for Britain's trade with non-European Union nations showed a deficit of 639 million pounds ($916 million) in November, well above October's 418 million pounds ($599 million) shortfall. Treasury minister Phillip Oppenheim welcomed the figures and said they showed exports were on a strong upward path. Britain exported goods worth 14.62 billion pounds ($20.9 billion) to the rest of the world in October. In September, total exports were just below 14 billion ($20.1 billion). "These figures again show that growth is broadly balanced and illustrate the growing success of the British economy," Oppenheim said. The ONS said the erratic pattern of trade figures made a trend difficult to discern. But it said its latest estimate suggested the global trade gap was narrowing.
MCAT	CME lumber futures were under pressure from the start, reflecting slow cash trade and tumbled to lower to sharply lower closes in most months on reports mills were lowering asking prices, traders said. Lumber ended $8.40 per thousand board feet lower to $1.10 higher with January off $8.00 at $400.50 per tbf and March off most at $403.60. Only September posted a gain. Active cash trade never materialized after the holidays as had been expected and poor weather conditions cut further into usage. Mills have begun to lower asking prices to spark some interest, traders said. "It's a weather market - retailers have no need to buy," said Neil Schmaedick, Smith Barney Forest Products analyst. General selling developed in futures and prices moved down into late sell stops before meeting support around $9 lower in active March. Liquidation continued in limitless January ahead of its expiration Wednesday. Pressure may continue in nearbys as weather conditions are not expected to improve any time soon, traders added.

MCAT	Gold prices are trading in an increasingly narrow $340-$346 range, but the market could be gearing up for a breakout, analysts said. The more volatile platinum group metals (PGM), meanwhile, are closely watching Russia-Japan supply talks for direction.   GOLD - With the focus of the precious metals complex concentrated on platinum and palladium, gold has been tethered to a relatively narrow range in recent weeks. But it may be getting ready to break out, analysts said. "The coiling is getting tighter and tighter within the limits. I would expect is to start moving shortly," said analyst Karen Jones of Credit Suisse First Boston. Market sentiment is being swayed by developments in Germany's plan to revalue gold reserves and signs that European Monetary Union may be delayed. But traders are also wary that forward selling by Australian gold producers could soon pressure the market. At 0900 GMT spot gold was indicated at $344.00/$344.40, compared to Monday's New York close of $343.30/$343.80.   SILVER - The market is clearly rangebound in a $4.60-$4.92 band, and needs to break above the top end of the band to negate any downside bias, Jones said. At 0900 GMT spot silver was indicated at $4.74/$4.76, up three cents from Monday's late close. PLATINUM/PALLADIUM - Both markets are extremely volatile within thin volumes, and will remain so until the Russian-Japanese supply saga comes to a close, analysts said. "Palladium has had a major reversal in the past few days. It got up to $202 and then came back to major support at $165," Jones said, adding that $162 was a key support level for the white metal. Palladium was last at $180.00/$184.00, up nearly $10. Platinum, meanwhile, should find good support in the $385-$390 area. Platinum was last indicated at $403.00/$406.00, compared to $399.50/$402.50 at the previous late close. --Lida Poletz, London newsroom +44 171 542 2936

ECAT	Finance Minister Theo Waigel said on Friday Germany's high unemployment justified an increase in the 1997 budget deficit contained in the 1997 supplementary budget. "The high unemployment justifies the rise in the 1997 deficit," Waigel told a news conference after Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet approved the 1997 supplementary budget.   The cabinet approved Waigel's 461 billion mark ($263 billion) draft budget for 1998 and a supplementary budget for 1997 that enlarges the deficit. The supplementary budget for this year raises the projected deficit to 71.2 billion marks from an original plan of 53.3 billion, but the government has said it still expects to qualify for European economic and monetary union (EMU). The cabinet approval sets the stage for parliamentary debate on the bills, expected in special sessions in August or September. Opposition Social Democrats have already attacked the government bills as shaky and lacking in credibility. Since the 1997 deficit exceeds government investment, the government must now, under the constitution, make a declaration that the excessive deficit is being used to combat an imbalance in the economy. -- Bonn newsroom, 49+ 228 260 97150
GCAT	Sri Lanka will launch a $4 million campaign to attract investors and tourists by stressing that a 13 year-long ethnic war has been largely limited to the country's north and east. Media and Tourism Minister Dharmasiri Senanayake told a news conference on Thursday the government had to counter moves by separatist Tamil guerrillas to tarnish Sri Lanka's image. "Presently we suffer from a problem of disinformation," he said. "These reports are exaggerated." Tourist arrivals to the Indian Ocean island dropped by 39.6 percent in April from a year ago, the Ceylon Tourist Board said. Sri Lanka had 403,101 tourists last year. The armed forces have battled the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam since 1983 in a war largely contained in the north and east and away from attractions such as the southern beaches, the central hill country and the ancient kingdoms in the north-central region. The rebels, however, have also hit economic targets. A suicide bomb attack on the Central Bank in Colombo in January killed almost 100 people.
ECAT	The Bank of Israel will raise its key lending rate by 0.5 percentage point at the end of the month, Israel Discount Bank said in an economic forecast released on Monday. The base rate stands at 12.7 percent on an annual basis. Economists at Discount said real short-term rates calculated according to the capital market's inflationary expectations had dropped from 6.5 percent in mid-June to 4.2 in late July. This, coupled with the 15-percent rise in M1 money supply in the last 12 months, would prompt the central bank to raise its lending rate, it said. "These developments point to a significant erosion in the level of monetary restraint," said the bank. "For this reason, economists at the bank estimate there is an increased chance the Bank of Israel will raise its monetary tender rate already at the end of this month by around 0.5 percent," it said. Discount expects the consumer price index to rise 0.7 percent to 0.8 percent in each of the next two months. It said 1997 inflation would reach 9.5 to 10 percent. The government has set a 1997 inflation target of seven to 10 percent. Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman said on Sunday inflation this year was running at 9.5 to 10 percent. The bank forecasts the 1997 budget deficit at 11 billion shekels ($3.1 billion), or about 3.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). That would exceed the government's 2.8-percent target by 1.5 billion shekels. It said partial second-quarter economic figures point to continued GDP growth of 2.5 to 3.0 percent. "Gross domestic product is expected to grow in the second half of 1997 and in 1998 at a three-percent annual rate," the bank said. - Jerusalem newsroom 972-2-5370502 ($ = 3.518 Israeli Shekels)

MCAT	Taiwan's central bank said on Friday it would issue T$3 billion in 14-day negotiable certificates of deposit later in the day. Bids would close at 11.15 local time (0315 GMT), a central bank official said. The issue coincides with a long bull run in Taiwan's stock market, where the index has pushed to a series of seven-year highs in recent weeks on record-breaking turnover. The central bank's repeated NCD issuance has been seen widely as a bid to cool the sizzling stock market, which has siphoned huge flows of liquidity out of the banking system.   The central bank has said repeatedly it would not adjust monetary policy merely to cool the red-hot stock market, but would continue to use issues of NCDs and treasury bills to fine-tune money supply. The stock market closed sharply higher on Thursday with the weighted index rising 251.36 points or 2.68 percent at 9,632.42. On Friday, the stock index opened higher by 103 points or 1.07 percent at 9,735.50. -- Taipei Newsroom (886-2-5080815)
ECAT	Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Saturday Israel's failure to implement its peace promises with the Palestinians had deterred his country's business community from cooperating with the Jewish state. Mubarak, who was speaking at a joint news conference with Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, said the Israeli government must work to create an atmosphere of peace if it wanted its Arab neighbours to normalise relations. Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 but has recently joined a loud chorus of Arab disapproval of the policies implemented by Israel's right wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu was elected on a platform that rejects trading Arab lands for peace -- a principle of a 1991 Madrid peace conference -- and he has infuriated Arabs by lifting a ban on building Jewish settlements on occupied territories. "The state cannot order the people in the private sector to invest with Israel or to normalise relations. It is a question of people's feelings under the current circumstances which depend on the political situation," said Mubarak. "There were joint projects between Egypt and Israel. There was cooperation and visits between businessmen from both sides but these have now been reduced as a result of the (Israeli) policies in place," he added. Egypt hosted the Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference earlier this month, which Israel also attended. The Egyptian president said the EU had an important part to play in the peace process but that the main role still belonged to the United States. Egypt along with other Arab states has welcomed an increase role for Europe in the peace process along with the United States, which is regarded by many in the region as being biased in Israel's favour. Scalfaro said his country supported the principle of trading land for peace. "Italy's role is not just to support President Mubarak in his work towards peace but it is also a role to unify the voice and work of the European Union for the sake of peace," said Scalfaro.

GCAT	Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Monday reacted to Malaysia's crackdown on a East Timor human rights conference by telling Australians they had to live and let live. "Let me simply say that different countries do things differently," he told reporters. "We do things our way, other countries do things their way." Malaysia on Monday deported 10 foreigners who participated in a banned political conference in Kuala Lumpur that was closed down by pro-government demonstrators on Saturday. Thirty-six others were deported on Sunday. An Australian bishop was among the 46 foreigners detained at the conference. An Australian journalist covering the event for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was also arrested and reported on Monday she had been held in "appalling" conditions. "If we are to have sensible relations with the nations of the region we ought to understand what they are and also what they are not," Howard said. "There is a tradition of free public assembly in Australia which is almost unique in the world. We are always going to be different on things like that, I think proudly different. But if we are to live in this region we have to all of us sort of understand that." Australia, with old democratic traditions, has had a sometimes uneasy relationship with regional neighbours, but Canberra heavily promotes the need for the country to integrate itself with Asia. "I don't see my role as the prime minister of this country to give endless moral lectures to the rest of the region," Howard said. Differences between Australia and its neighbours have been emphasised since an independent member of parliament, Pauline Hanson, stirred up a debate on Asian immigration. However, both sides of Australian politics have rejected Hanson's call for an immediate halt to immigration and her warning that Asians were swamping the country.
ECAT	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor has indicated a softening of interest rates in view of the government's efforts to moderate the rate of growth of its borrowing programme, the Business Standard newspaper reported on Wednesday. "The pressure on interest rates can ease only if the extent of government borrowing comes down," the paper quoted RBI governor C. Rangarajan as saying. "I think there is a clear indication now that the fiscal deficit will go down from five percent to 4.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)," it quoted him as saying. "I think that is the most important thing which will have a bearing upon the level of interest rates," Rangarajan said. Current prime lending rates of foreign banks are 17-17.5 percent and 14.5-15.5 percent for local banks. -- Bombay newsroom +91-22-265 9000

"Eased concerns over the rubber stocks encouraged sentiment," one trader said.

GCAT	At least four people were killed and several injured on Friday when police opened fire on a violent mob in India's commercial hub of Bombay, police officials said. They said the situation was later brought under control at Ghatkopar, about 15 km (10 miles) from the city centre.   Police said trouble started when a statue of leader Bhimrao Ambedkar, known as the father of the Indian constitution, was found garlanded with shoes, viewed as an insulting gesture. A mob surrounded the statue and pelted police with stones when they tried to push through the crowd to the statue. The mob held up traffic on a busy highway during the morning rush hour and set fire to at least two private vehicles, police said. Ambedkar is treated like a god by lower classes in India's rigid Hindu caste society.
MCAT	Britain's FTSE 100 index opened mixed on Monday, with sterling's strength, interest rate concerns and continued pre-Budget nerves keeping investors wary, dealers said. Attention was focused on the futures market, they said, after the September contract dived to a discount to spot on Friday, dragging down the FTSE. The blue-chip index opened 3.1 points firmer at 4,597.0, helped higher by a leap in National Westminster Bank shares, up 30p at 776-1/2 on press reports that it could be the subject of a bid from Barclays Plc .
GCAT	Safer techniques for the diagnosis of certain prenatal disorders may be on the horizon, according to an article on Friday in the British medical journal, The Lancet. A study of 43 pregnant women revealed the presence of foetal genetic material in the mother's plasma, a location that previously had been overlooked, according to researchers from Britain, Italy and Hong Kong. As a result, it should become possible to screen women early in pregnancy for abnormalities carried by the father using a simple blood test, the researchers wrote. "It would mean that a proportion of women might be spared an invasive genetic diagnosis," said Dr. James Wainscoat of John Radcliffe Hospital near Oxford. A common invasive technique for detecting foetal abnormalities is amniocentesis. Under this procedure, foetal cells are obtained by inserting a long, hollow needle into the womb. This procedure carries the risk of miscarriage. In their study, the researchers sought to find out whether the blood of pregnant women could provide the same type of genetic information for detecting abnormalities as had been discovered in the blood of cancer patients. Wainscoat said the study's findings were "very surprising" in so far as they highlighted the importance of the mother's blood plasma as a source of information. "People had never anticipated that DNA (genetic material) from the foetus is mostly present in the plasma rather than in the cellular part of the blood," he said. Traditionally, the plasma has been discarded in certain research protocols, he added. Wainscoat said the study's findings could result in the use of simple, harmless screening tests for foetuses thought to be in danger of inheriting an abnormality from the father. However, if the foetus were found to be at risk, a further and probably invasive diagnosis would be necessary. The screening test would not be effective if mother and father carried the same abnormality, he added.
CCAT	Chubb Corp declined comment on a published report that a company run by Patriot American Hospitality Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Paul Nussbaum has agreed in principle to acquire the assets of Chubb's real estate unit. The Wall Street Journal said Patriot American Management & Leasing Co, a private firm, had agreed in principle to acquire Chubb's Bellemead Development Corp for about $1 billion. Patriot American was not available for comment.   Last Friday Chubb said it had entered into an agreement with a prospective buyer to perform due diligence and that it anticipated executing a contract for the sale of substantially all of its commercial properties. In October Chubb said it had hired Goldman Sachs to help it evaluate strategic options for its life insurance and real estate businesses. Last month Chubb reached a definitive agreement to sell its life insurance business to Jefferson-Pilot Corp for $875 milion cash.
MCAT	COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended lower Tuesday, despite rumors of central bank activity, with the volume in COMEX copper exceeding the volume in COMEX gold. "There was very little of note going on in precious metals today, other than some rolling of May silver positions into the July contract," FIMAT New York trader John Tyree said. COMEX June gold settled down $1.50 an ounce at $343.40, after trading a $345.10-342.90 range. Estimated total COMEX gold volume was only 11,000 lots.   Bullion banks were the main sellers, rather than the funds, traders said, amid rumors of unconfirmed rumors of European central bank activity, traders said. But the Dutch central bank denied it had been selling gold. In January this year the Dutch central bank confirmed it had sold 300 tonnes of its gold reserves in late 1996. Daily momentum oscillators in June gold, such as a standard nine-day relative strength indicator (RSI), have recovered from the oversold levels seen after last week's slump to contract lows, but the momentum downtrend had not yet reversed, analysts said. Meanwhile, the contract's five-day moving average remained well below both its 21-day and 55-day average, suggesting the renewed downtrend was still intact. In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted $341.10/60 compared to the London Tuesday afternoon fix at $341.60 and the New York close Monday around $342.70/10. While physical offtake is seen robust below $340 an ounce, concerns about the possibility of another rise in U.S. interest rates at the next Federal Reserve FOMC meeting on May 20, as well as worries about further European central bank activity are likely to limit any advance in gold, analysts said. In producer news, South Africa's Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd Freegold said Tuesday a fire at its Western Holdings No 1 shaft had hit about six kilograms of production and there could be further losses. Meanwhile, workers went on strike at South Africa's East Rand Propietary Mines Ltd. COMEX May silver ended down 2.0 cents at $4.715, after seeing a $4.770-4.705 range. Estimated total COMEX silver volume was 21,000 contracts. Open interest in COMEX silver fell a sharp 2,130 lots Monday to 99,266 contracts, after climbing to its highest levels since August last year on Friday at 102,323 contracts. Silver prices have also changed little in the past few days, after finding support around $4.70 in the bullion market last week, following a slide to two-month lows. Fundamentals in silver are more bullish than for gold, analysts said. Despite rising mine production since 1995, consumption is expected to reach record levels in the U.S. and India this year, while COMEX stocks have declined by nearly 50 percent since 1994. NYMEX July platinum ended down $4.10 an ounce at $376.40, while NYMEX June palladium lost $1.00 to $154.75, on light profit taking, but the physical market remained very tight, traders said. PGM lease rates remained high in Zurich, traders said, with the physical market likely to stay very tight until Russian supplies to Japan resume. The fundamental outlook for PGMs remains the most bullish of any metals in the precious metals complex, analysts said. Heavy supplies of platinum and palladium from Russia last year swamped the market, but Russian PGM exports have fallen sharply this year after the breakdown of the Russia/Japan supplycontract talks in December. The large supply/demand surpluses of the past three or four years are now being absorbed and automotive demand is rising quickly, analysts said. --email: clive.mckeef @ reuters.com ((Clive McKeef, New York Commodities Desk,+1-212-859-1641))

CCAT	Stock in MCI Communications Corp was six percent higher on Friday on renewed rumors that either GTE Corp or British Telecommunications Plc was to buy the company. None of the companies would comment, citing policy on market speculation. MCI stock was 1-1/2 firmer at 26-5/8 at 1200 EST/1700 GMT and topped the Nasdaq actives list. "I've heard this GTE rumor before and it doesn't make sense," said analyst Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. He said GTE is already offering long distance to its own customers and does not want to buy MCI's customer base.   Analysts see more logic to the BT side of the rumor, as the British carrier already has a 20 percent stake in MCI and the two companies share Concert, a joint venture serving multinational corporations' communications needs. However, BT is blocked from increasing its MCI stake very far by a federal rule on foreign ownership of U.S. telecommunications and media assets, they said. "I don't think you can get around rule 310 B however you do it," Klugman said of the 1934 legislation that bars a higher stake.   -- Nick Louth, New York Newsroom 212 859 1712

MCAT	ARA spot fuel oil bunkers rose again on Friday, drawn upwards by firmer paper numbers rather than strong fundemental demand. Marine diesel and gas oil prices were also higher, boosted by recent IPE futures gains. Dealers said Rotterdam 380 cst was seen around $103-104 delivered with 180 cst about $3-4 higher. Spot bunker enquiries were seen to be around 10,000-15,000 tonnes. Hamburg market followed on the tail of higher ARA prices, but demand was slow. "I don't know whether they (shippers) have been scared off (by the higher prices) or whether it's a typically quiet Friday," said one trader. In the Mediterranean, bunkering was steady, but unexceptional. Prices were broadly unchanged, but holding a firmer tone. Some shortages were seen in Italy and Spain and there was little sign of suitable spec cargoes. Fujairah bunkers were firmer, buoyed by good demand and congestion difficulties until the end of next week. Cape Towan was out of fuel and will not be quoting until the second week of September. Durban prices were also stronger up at $107-$111 ex wharf. -- Matthew Jones, London Newsroom, +44 171 542 8980
MCAT	Base metal prices ended an uncertain Tuesday LME session mixed, although market-leaders copper and aluminium were softer with sentiment turning negative, traders said. Elsewhere, the volatile nickel market was firmer, tin continued its correction, but lead and zinc were unimpressive as summer slowdown factors held sway. "The mood and the good sentiment has disappeared from the metals," one said. Nickel was the major mover today, and trading remained volatile during the afternoon. Prices continued to whip around, albeit above support levels to finally end at $7,180, up $155. Traders said the wide price moves were due to opposite fundamental developments, with overnight news of the strike at Inco's Sudbury facilities driving the market higher. Subsequent news that Russia's Norilsk was looking at a 20 percent increase in production this year took the heat out of the rally. But in the short-term, caution over the Inco strike is likely to restrict the downside, they said. Copper also fluctuated throughout the session, but in a tighter range and mostly towards the lower end of the band. There was reasonable support around $2,470/75 again, but a covering rally in mid-afternoon was soundly rebuffed around $2,500. "These bounces are getting smaller and not too convincing," the trader said. Talk that China may be a seller of copper, rather than a hoped-for buyer, was an unnerving factor, with some saying stocks may rise in the Far East soon. Last three months trade was at $2,479, down $6 from the previous kerb. Cash/threes was marginally softer at $56/60 backwardation. Aluminium was pummelled by fund liquidation and spread lending operations, against a background of increased availability in Europe. Again, the market was unwilling to hold a key upside level at $1,600, and by the close prices were back at $1,578, an $18 loss. In lead, there was little significant action, with price movements dictated by the overall trend. Last business was at an unchanged $626. Zinc met good buying ahead of a test of anticipated support around $1,310/15, although there continues to be concern over Chinese deliveries in Singapore. Nevertheless, last trade was at $1,334, up $4 from Monday. Tin continued to build on Monday's corrective rally from 14-1/2 month lows, helped by the upturn in consumer business those levels fostered. However, the market is wary of talk of Russian stockpile metal being shipped to the West. Last trade was at $5,680, up $40. The alloy market was stable, and closed at $1,475/80 a tonne. --Martin Hayes, London Newsroom 44 171 542 8080

GCAT	A Red Cross official walked into the besieged Japanese ambassador's house in Lima early Saturday and was still inside over half an hour later, witnesses said. The man, wearing the white vest of the Red Cross, was seen by reporters as he strolled into the residence, where Marxist rebels are holding 72 hostages, just before 2 a.m. local time. There was no explanation for the visit at such an unusual hour, and an official at the Red Cross office in Lima gave no information. Reports varied as to whether the man was carrying anything. In the past, visits by Red Cross doctors to the residence have led to speculation about ill health among the hostages or the roughly 20 Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels holding them. None of the hostages have been reported acutely ill recently. But a few suffer from diabetes, heart disease or other chronic illnesses, and several are reported to be suffering from stress-related disorders.

CCAT	The profits of three of the four major petrochemical companies in eastern China dropped sharply in 1996 due to duplication of facilities, the official Economic Daily said on Wednesday. However, officials attributed the profit drop to reasons such as sluggish market demand and rising international prices for crude oil. Over capacity and lack of cooperation had reduce the competitive strength of the four petrochemical firms based near Nanjing, capital of eastern Jiangsu province, and eroded profits, the Economic Daily said. However, the newspaper did not give figures for the decline in the profits of Yizheng Chemical Fibre Co Ltd, Yangzi Petrochemical Co and Jinling Petrochemical Co. The Nanjing Chemical Industrial Corp reportedly made a profit. Citing problems of over capacity, the newspaper said Yizheng Chemical Fibre, under the Chinese General Association of Textile Industry, planned to expand its PTA capacity to 600,000 tonnes before the year 2000 from a current 20,000 tonnes a year to meet its own demand, it said. Yangzi Petrochemical Co, a subsidary of the China National Petrochemical Co (Sinopec), with 600,000 tonnes of existing PTA production capacity could not sell its output to Yizheng and was now devloping its refining capacity, it said. However, the refining capacity of Yangzi had already reached 5.0 million tonnes a year while Jinling Petrochemical Co, also a Sinopec subsidiary, had refining capacity of 7.0 million tonnes, it said. Both were already unable to work at full capacity because of shortages of raw materials, it said. However, an official of Yangzi attributed the drop in profits to sluggish market demand rather than overlapping output. Pre-tax profits of Yangzi fell to 1.554 billion yuan this year from 4.5 billion yuan in 1995, he said. The pre-tax profits of Jinling declined to 1.414 billion yuan this year from 1.8 billion yuan in 1995, a company official said by telephone. He said rising international prices of crude in 1996 and heavy loan repayments had cut into profits last year. The profits of Yizheng dropped sharply in 1996 compared with the previous year, a company official said in a telephone interview. He refused to give a reason, saying the final profit figure would be issued in April. -- Beijing Newsroom (8610) 6532 1921
MCAT	Dealers marked down prices of some Russian shares in the hope of speculative gains later after news President Boris Yeltsin had ordered a complete government reshuffle on Tuesday, but traders said the fall was short-lived. At 1130 GMT Rostelekom  slipped off its early highs of $4.10 to $4.02, LUKoil  fell to $14.40 from $14.43 and Norilsk Nickel was $6.56 after $6.75. Yeltsin ordered a full reorganisation of the government, leaving only Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais in place. The bulk of the government will be formed within one week, he said in a decree. Traders said the news was a good opportunity for short-term speculation for Russian brokers. "Shares went down while people are having lunch. When New York opens we shall go up again," said IFCI-Moscow Partners chief trader Alexei Abdurakhimov. "Chernomyrdin and Chubais are staying and the rest of the people in the government are not very important for the market." Traders said Western investors were not worried by the coming reshuffle, taking no action on the market. "Prices are changing in different directions. I have an impression that price changes are not connected to the presidential decree. I canot see any hasty actions on the part of investors," said Regent European Securities trader Alexander Fonarkov. --Olga Popova, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520

ECAT	District of Columbia said its sale of $168.87 million general obligation bonds was postponed to Oct 3 from Sept 26. "The District expects that the sale of the bonds will occur on or about Oct 3 and close on or about Oct 8," Anthony Williams, chief financial officer for the city, said in a press statement. Williams said the city will announce the extended sale date and closing date over news wire services at least 24 hours before the sale date.   The sale was postponed to give Congress more time to enact a bill that would waive a current 30-day congressional review requirement for pending D.C. bond sales. Questions should be directed to Thomas Huestis, deputy chief financial officer for D.C., at 202-727-6055. --Vicky Stamas, 202-898-8314
GCAT	President Mobutu Sese Seko supports sending a multinational force to Zaire to help get relief to refugees and help them return home to Rwanda, a U.N. envoy said after meeting him on Wednesday. Envoy Raymond Chretien quoted Mobutu as saying he would do his utmost to maintain calm in his country to let the multinational force work.   "President Mobutu told me Zaire would do everything possible to maintain this period of calm so that the multinational force discussed in Nairobi may be able to rapidly allow for food to reach refugees and help them return to their home countries, including of course Rwanda," Chretien said. "He was very clear, very categorical," Chretien told reporters after the meeting at Mobutu's French Riviera villa. He said the period of calm Mobutu mentioned referred to the unilateral ceasefire declared by Rwanda-backed Tutsi rebels fighting Zairean troops. An eight-nation African summit in Nairobi on Tuesday called on the United Nations to send a "neutral" protection force to create havens from which refugees could go home along safe corridors.
ECAT	Australia's prospects for improved growth through 1997 were enhanced on Friday when February retail trade data showed that consumers appeared to have returned to the stores following a disappointing Christmas. But while improving, there was no danger that the economy was accelerating at such a speed as to require the brakes to be applied in the form of a rate rise yet, economists said. Retail trade rose 0.8 percent in Feburary, official figures showed. It was seen as a strong figure because it followed a very large 2.7 percent rise in January retail trade.   "Today's result represents the second consecutive month of strong retail sales, suggesting that consumers have now returned to the shopping malls they deserted in the second half of 1996," Nomura Research senior economist Andrew Pease said. Economists said the data fitted in with anecdotal evidence that spending had picked up from early in 1997, and which had remained strong into March and April. "Consumer spending has been the missing link in the economic recovery," Commonwealth Bank senior economist Michael Blythe said. "It looks like it's coming back strongly."   The February rise took retail trade to 4.4 percent above its trough of last September. Over the past year, retail trade was up 3.3 percent, its highest annual increase since last August. "Numbers like this indicate that we've passed a turning point in the economy and an acceleration is underway," SBC Warburg senior economist Guy Bruten said. The strong start to the year in retail trade follows trade data on Thursday showing that exports have also been strong in the first two months of year, and economists said both should make solid contributions to first quarter growth.   However, the data on the day was not all one-sided. The retail trade data showed some patchiness across sectors, and seperate figures showed the building approvals fell 3.7 percent in February. A small fall had been expected after the very strong 10.4 percent rise in January but not only was the fall larger than expected, the composition of the fall suggested more weakness than economists had been factoring in. The January rise was dominated by rises in multi-dwelling approvals, which had been expected to unwind while approvals for private houses were expected to strengthen.   Instead, private houses were down 5.6 percent while other dwelling units fell 1.6 percent in February. "There is a housing recovery out there,it just isn't very robust yet," Bankers Trust chief economist Chris Caton said. The net result, economists said, was that while growth would lift through 1997, it would not be at a rapid pace. Accordingly, there was no need for monetary policy to be adjusted. "Economic conditions are improving but are still a long way short of justifying anything other than a 'leave rates on hold' stance from the Reserve Bank," Westpac economist Stephen McNabb said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
CCAT	Northern Telecom Ltd Chief Executive Jean Monty said on Tuesday the company's revenues should grow by 15 to 20 percent in 1997. "We still maintain that we can meet our targets and that the revenue growth will be in the minimum mid-teens. So it's probably going to be between the 15 and 20 percent range," Monty said in a telephone interview. He said Nortel's balance sheet looked solid in the first quarter and added that the company should soon announce the sale of customer financing debt, including the US$1.2 billion vendor financing of the Sprint Corp wireless contract.   "The balance sheet remains very strong with a low debt ratio at 26 percent. We will announce pretty soon the layoff of major customer financings, which will give us even more dry powder for the longer term in terms of doing more business," Monty said. "(The Sprint deal) is done. We're going to announce that in the next couple of weeks," he added. Monty said the long delay in getting the financing deal done was due to its complexity. "It's a billion dollar deal," he said.   "And what's interesting about that is when you compare that to Lucent (Technologies Inc's) growth...they showed their growth in the U.S. market for operators at around 21 percent," Monty said. Nortel's earnings per share were US$0.41 versus US$0.32 in the prior year period. Monty said he was pleased with the growth rate given that it was paired with strong sales growth. "So earnings, after-tax margins, remained solid at the same level as last year even in the face of significant growth in revenues. Usually when you grow your busines that fast, you can see some softening of margins," Monty said.

CCAT	The Slovak branch of the Czech-based Ekoagrobanka a.s. has been sold to Slovakia's Dopravni Banka a.s., Ekoagrobanka's controlling shareholder Czech Union Banka a.s. said in a statement.   Josef Rericha, spokesman for Union Banka which holds a 99.7 percent stake in Ekoagrobanka, said the Slovak branch had been sold in an agreement signed on Wednesday, but he did not disclose any further details of the transaction. Union Banka a.s. in September closed its Ekoagrobanka branches temporarily to protect deposits soon after the Slovak central bank revoked its operating licence. Union Banka, which took majority control of Ekoagrobanka after it had been under forced administration of the Czech central bank since January, said then it would appeal against the National Bank of Slovakia's (NBS) move, calling it unjustified. The Ostrava-based Union Banka bought its stake in Ekoagrobanka from the state-run Czech Konosolidacni Banka which assumed control of Ekoagrobanka when it was put into forced administration in January. Ekoagrobanka's forced administration officially ended last Friday, Union Banka said. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003
CCAT	Western Resources Inc may need a partner if it wants to retake the offensive in its hostile bid for ADT Ltd, analysts and investment bankers said. Western's stock and cash offer of $3.5 billion, or $22.50 a share, is competing against Tyco International Ltd's friendly stock agreement, worth $29 per share, or a total of $5.6 billion.   The Tyco deal, disclosed Monday, is structured as a reverse merger, which neutralizes Western's "dissenter rights," or its option to take cash for its ADT shares at a court-supervised appraisal. As a result, Western's best hope of prevailing is to top Tyco's offer, investment bankers and analysts said. "Outside of Western offering $30 per share, or a considerably raised cash component, which I don't think they can do, they would have to find a big partner," said Jeffrey Kessler, a Lehman Brothers analyst who follows ADT, which installs and services electronic security systems.   Under a complex arrangement, Tyco agreed to merge with a unit of ADT; the ADT parent company would then be renamed Tyco International Ltd, Tyco said. Dissenter rights allow shareholders who disagree with a proposed merger to go to court to obtain an appraised market value of their shares. They then would be offered cash for their stock based on that appraisal. If Western had such rights and took cash for its shares, it could destroy the pooling-of-interest accounting, a condition necessary for the Tyco deal to proceed.   "The Tyco agreement is much closer to our valuation of what ADT is worth, which is far more than $22.50 per share, because ADT is moving from being an electronic security company to one providing a gateway to the home to control all kinds of sensors," Kessler said. Western, a Kansas-based utility company, already owns 27 percent of ADT, or 38.3 million shares. It acquired the stake in multiple transactions for $589 million, which equals a cost basis of $15.40 per share, a Western spokesman said.   With its ADT stake, Western also stands to walk away with an estimated $500 million gain under the current offer by Tyco, a diversified maker of industrial and commercial products. While the sources did not know of any ongoing discussions between Western and other possible partners, they said companies that would make the most sense as co-bidders include Ameritech Corp and MCI Communications Corp.   Ameritech could join Western in sweetening its offer for ADT, though any cooperation would have to be structured around limitations imposed on Ameritech's buying additional alarm-monitoring companies, as mandated in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, according to analysts and attorneys. While Ameritech is barred from acquiring additional companies such as ADT, it is allowed to acquire select assets of electronic alarm businesses, according to a Washington attorney who helped write the act while on the staff of the House Commerce Committee.   Ameritech can "grow the business, acquire customer lists and so forth," he said. Western and Ameritech have declined to comment on a possible joint bid for ADT. A partnership with MCI would expand an existing relationship initiated when Western acquired Westinghouse Security. The latter provides home and business security monitoring bundled with other MCI telephone services. An MCI spokesman declined to comment on the speculation, but said the company "is not aggressively marketing the security products at this time." ((--Wall Street Desk, 212-859-1734))

MCAT	Shortages of platinum and palladium in world markets pushed the white metals' prices higher again Friday, while dealers and manufacturers needing the metal wait for Russian shipments to resume after a five-month suspension. "There is extreme supply tightness, which has virtually brought the physical market to a halt," Refco New York analyst Tim Porter said. "And NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange) futures trade in the metals has been hampered." The shortage forced German catalytic converter maker Degussa AG to warn Friday that production curbs were possible in another three to four weeks if supplies did not improve. Degussa produces about 20 percent of the world's catalytic converters, which are installed on cars to filter pollution from emission systems and typically use platinum or palladium. The supply squeeze is resulting in delivery periods on spot physical transactions being negotiated out to 30 days, instead of the usual two days, to avoid defaults, traders said. NYMEX July platinum jumped $18.30 to $454.90 an ounce after setting a contract high at $473.80. In the physical market, spot platinum was around $465 an ounce at the close, after touching $500, the highest level since 1990. NYMEX June palladium, which expires June 25, rose $13.85 to $214 an ounce after touching $224 an ounce. The more active September palladium contract gained $5.85 to $179 an ounce. In the physical market, spot palladium was around $225 an ounce, after setting a 17-year high earlier this week. Meanwhile, relief was unlikely from South Africa, which produces about 60 percent of the world's platinum. "I don't believe South African producers have stocks of metal," said Barry Davison, the managing director of Amplats, the world's largest supplier. "I don't think relief can come from here. The relief can only come from a resumption of Russian supplies and dis-hoarding of the metal." Russia produces about 20 percent of the world's platinum and about 60 percent of its palladium. The German bank Dresdner called on the U.S. Defence Stockpile to release some of the 431,000 ounces of platinum and the 1.3 million ounces of palladium it holds. But the stockpile's manager, Peter Roman, said on Thursday that congressional approval was needed for another sale and it could not be obtained before the end of summer. Earlier this year, the stockpile sold 10,000 ounces of platinum and 15,000 ounces of palladium from the U.S. strategic reserve. Russian officials told Japanese traders on Wednesday that Russian platinum and palladium exports would resume June 20, but Friday the head of the precious metals division of Russia's Finance Ministry warned that exports to Japan in 1997 would be a little below the levels seen last year. The supply squeeze has been exacerbated by hedge fund accumulation of the metal, analysts said. New York-based Tiger Management is believed to have acquired a stockpile of about 1.5 million ounces of palladium, representing about 20 percent of 1996 world supply.

MCAT	U.S. Midwest direct hog prices Monday were seen selling steady with a weak tone amid ideas weekend rainfall may stall fieldwork and free farmers to market hogs, resulting in large runs, livestock dealers said. Cash hog prices also were said to be vulnerable as this week's price advance outran pork gains and eroded packer operating margins, which could lead to slaughter cutbacks, they said. Hog marketings also could escalate Monday if early prices are lower, dealers said. Lower prices could spark panic selling of hogs producers may have been holding back.   "Nothing like a $0.50 or $1.00 lower opening after a week of higher prices to get people to unload the hogs they've been holding back," one hog buyer said. Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota top prices for hogs delivered to plants on Monday could range from $57.00 to $57.50. Friday's price of $57.50 was $3.00 higher than a week ago, USDA statistics showed. Illinois top prices at plants were seen steady at $57.50. Friday's top of $57.50 was $2.50 higher for the week. Indiana/Ohio top prices for hogs delivered to the plant could also range $57.00 to $57.50. The Indiana/Ohio cash hog top of $57.50 Friday also was up $2.50, compared with a week ago.

CCAT	The Colombian government sold its 46.58 percent stake in the sprawling Cerro Matoso nickel mine to a subsidiary of South Africa's Gencor Ltd for 178.4 billion pesos ($165.8 million) Tuesday, a senior Finance Ministry official said.

The mine is the fourth largest producer of nickel in the world with an annual output of about 65 million pounds annually.   Billiton's was the only bid for the plant in an open auction conducted simultaneously through the country's three stock exchanges in Bogota, Medellin and Cali, said Clemente del Valle head of public credit at the Finance Ministry. The company bought the entire packet of 5.38 million shares at the base price of 33,148 pesos, Del Valle said.

GCAT	Failure is something both sides are refusing to contemplate with so much at stake when Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain clash in the key match of the French league championship on Sunday. Neither coach is prepared to announce his line-up until the last minute for fear of his opposite number taking the slightest advantage. Confidence has been the word on the lips and in the minds of players determined that this season they will make up for the failures of the previous seasons in their bid for the first division title. "We're going to play to win... In our heads we have remained positive. Let's think of victory, the title. A team like Paris can only have that in their heads," said PSG's Brazilian Rai. After a string of poor results, will heads roll if PSG lose and fall a massive seven points behind leaders Monaco? A poker-faced manager Ricardo, who had his resignation turned down by PSG after last week's 6-1 humiliation by Juventus in the European Super Cup, is not giving his feelings away. But PSG chief executive Michel Denisot said: "I don't think there'll be a resignation, I don't want to believe that." Monaco's Brazilian Anderson, lifting a silence he imposed on himself earlier in the week, said he would not be affected by the PSG syndrome that spoilt his game when the two sides met in Paris and drew 0-0 in September. Linked with PSG since the off-season, Anderson complained of the pressure in the build-up to the Parc des Princes match badly affecting his concentration. Now more settled in Monaco and saying he will stay if they win the title, Anderson fears PSG's ability to react positively to their adverse situation. "They're a big club and we know that in this kind of match a big club can find its identity again," Anderson said. With his compatriots in the PSG side including his idol Rai in mind, Anderson added: "They have the players with the mentality to surpass themselves ... and allow PSG to rediscover their earlier confidence and we must beware of that." Anderson said the match would be decided in midfield where both sides have gifted technical players. Monaco welcome back Belgian Enzo Scifo from injury with a new attitude to contribute to Monaco's bid for a first league title since 1988. "I'm back to my best, I no longer have any apprehension. If I had any worries due above all to the difficulty of finding my rhythm... the intense preparation for this re-start (after the winter recess) has borne its fruits," Scifo said. Normally accustomed to the leading role in the side, Scifo said the team has been playing very well in his absence and he is "keen to behave like a worker." "There are players capable of taking the creative role, Ali Benarbia does so marvellously and I like playing beside him as long as I can contribute in another role. "I have the feeling today of being in a great club, there is everything to achieve... everyone is concentrated, we are conscious of our strength " he said. Defender Emmanuel Petit, also back from injury, compared the current Monaco side with that which last won the title under Arsene Wenger in 1988. "We have become aware as a team that we can and must win something this year and we know today we're better than the team of the last few years," he said. "Only the side in which I made my debut with (Glenn) Hoddle and (Dominique) Battiston can compare in terms of the new spirit," added Petit, who said he has been linked with Tottenham Hotspur in the past and would like to play in England. "The match will be hot, that's for sure. I just hope that what's at stake won't predominate over a good game as is too often the case in this kind of match," said Petit, who is expected to play in a four-man defence. Meanwhile, PSG's other Brazilian Leonardo is fighting to get fit for the match after a bad bout of flu. Probable teams: Monaco - 1-Fabien Barthez; 2-Patrick Blondeau, 5-Franck Dumas, 4-Martin Djetou, 6-Emmanuel Petit; 15-Sylvain Legwinski, 7-John Collins, 8-Ali Benarbia, 10-Enzo Scifo; 9-Anderson, 12-Thierry Henry.

CCAT	About 250 angry investors gathered outside the offices of a local businessman in this former Dutch colony on Thursday after he said he could not pay back money they put into his pyramid saving scheme. Police held back the crowd amid fears that the crisis over get-rich-quick schemes could become violent. Local economists say the saving schemes -- which rely on ever increasing numbers of depositors to pay off old investors -- contain at least half the amount of savings in commercial banks and that many investors have borrowed heavily to take advantage of the 120 percent annual interest rates on offer. Local banks offer rates of less than 20 percent per year. One man brandishing a wooden stick was thrown out of the building of Roepsingh Ramtahalsingh's NV Roep. "If I don't get my money back within three weeks, I'll blow up the place," another man in his 30s, dressed in T-shirt and jeans said. Thursday's events were the first sign of violence in a crisis which has been brewing for more than two months. Roep began to run into difficulties in April when the collapse of similar savings schemes in Albania led to mass rioting and focused attention on pyramid banking. The flow of new investors dried up and Roep said he could no longer pay interest. Roep has now asked for between one and three years to pay back savings as he sells off his other businesses. Investors said on Thursday they would form an action group to force Roep to pay and asked the government to intervene. "It's time the government did something," one elderly man said. "They should lock Roep up because he's a thief." Government officials in the South American country of 430,000 people have made no comment on the crisis, which local economists have called a timebomb, other than a vague commitment to protect small investors.
MCAT	LIFFE coffee futures opened sharply lower on Wednesday, with July down $120 at $1,700 per tonne and then quickly extending its losses. July's drop to the lowest since May 2 came after a weak close in New York on Tuesday, when panicky speculators dumped their holdings on forecasts of milder weather in key producer Brazil. July closed down 35.35 cents at 217.95 cents per pound on Tuesday after hitting a one-month low.   Brazil had seen some chilly nights recently, which had raised fears of a damaging frost like that of 1994, when prices last soared, traders said. But such worries were eased when weather forecasters said temperatures in the country's key coffee regions should edge up in coming days and no damaging cold was foreseeable in the near term. September robusta coffee broke initial support at $1,772, a 61.8 percent retracement of its bull run dating back to January. It also broke next support at $1,710.

Their controversial report, compiled by the WTO's usually cautious secretariat, said only negotiation among the trade body's 123 members could provide the "global and balanced framework" for such a deal. The outcome of such talks -- rejected by several key emerging economies -- "will have an important impact on the efficiency with which scarce supplies of capital and technology will be employed in the next decade and beyond," it declared. "If there were multilateral rules in the area of foreign direct investment and countries could bind their FDI regime in the WTO the way they can bind their tariffs and certain other things, then this would reduce the amount of uncertainty surrounding investment across international frontiers," Richard Blackhurst, director of WTO's economic research division and joint author of the report, told a news conference. "Companies always have the option to invest at home. Private investors always have the option of putting their money in an investment that is domestic rather than international. "So if you can reduce the amount of uncertainty facing investors making investment across borders where the payoff period for the investment can be as long as 20 or 25 years -- they have to predict policies that far out -- then to me it is inconceivable that there wouldn't be more FDI than there would otherwise be," said Blackhurst, an American economist. The team of analysts said that investment and trade were mutually supportive in a joint process "central to development strategies and, more generally, to worldwide efforts to increase wealth and raise living standards." WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero has already said the report makes a compelling case for tackling in the trade body the fast-growing volume of FDI flowing into national economies. The European Union, Japan and Canada want agreement on some sort of WTO talks on investment rules to be included in a declaration to be issued by the flegling trade body's first ministerial conference in Singapore in December. Their proposal has been fiercely resisted by some developing countries -- primarily India, Malaysia and Tanzania but also Indonesia -- which argue that WTO rules would make it impossible for them to pursue national industrial policies. "Member countries face a certain policy decision. In the short-run, the policy-decision is what to do at Singapore -- whether to create a working party to begin not to negotiate but just to examine the issues, to explore in more depth what we have begun to explore in the study," Blackhurst told reporters. "We make it very clear in the study that we are not prejudging that. It is a decision that the member countries have to take," he added. Any accord in the WTO, which replaced the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in January 1995, would be based on the principle of national treatment -- or setting the same rules for both foreign and domestic investors. Last week a senior Indian official told an investment forum at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) that his country, although opening up its once state-dominated economy, could not accept such restrictions. Major powers argue that the size of FDI in the global economy -- soaring to an estimated $315 billion last year from $60 billion in 1985 -- makes a global agreement vital.
ECAT	July producer price index data, released at 0900 GMT, failed to excite South African markets on Monday, coming in bang in line with the Reuters consensus forecast, up 6.6 percent year-on-year. But the breakdown of the figures confounded many analysts with no perceptible price pressure from imports during the month. The month-on-month rate of increase in imported products was nil, giving an annual rate of 4.9 percent. Some economists had predicted the imported component would rise over six percent, reflecting the sharp fall in the rand this year. Locally produced items, however, increased 1.1 percent month-on-month, or 7.3 percent year-on-year. The Central Statistical Service said there were relatively large monthly increases in the price indices for agriculture (up 1.4 percent), fishing (+4.6), food at manufacturing (+2.0), beverages (+2.1), leather (+1.4), footwear (+6.4), wood (+2.2), paper (+1.4), chemicals (+1.8) rubber and plastic (+3.4) and gas and water (+10.2). -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003
MCAT	The Venezuelan bolivar closed marginally off in quiet trade as the Central Bank hung back from selling dollars into the market, traders said. The unit closed Thursday at 487.50/488.50 per dollar, which remains the Central Bank's reference rate until Monday due to the U.S.'s Independence day holiday. "The Central Bank didn't sell much ... and with the fall in interest rates this week the exchange rate's come under a bit more pressure," said one trader. Yields on benchmark six month TEMs, used to set wider interest rates, fell nearly one point to 20.78 percent in the Central Bank's regular Wednesday auction. Venezuela's foreign exchange market is unusual in that the Central Bank is its largest single supplier of dollars, which blurs the difference between the Central Bank supplying liquidity and intervening.

GCAT	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked Palestinian President Yasser Arafat for a meeting as soon as possible because of clashes that have killed at least 50 people, an Israeli official said. A senior official who flew with Netanyahu to Israel from a European trip which cut short by the violence told reporters traveling on the plane from Germany that Netanyahu had made the request in a phone call to Arafat.
ECAT	Finance Minister P.Chidambaram said on Saturday that India was capable of raising its annual economic growth rate to eight percent by the end of the century but needed to remove remaining controls over business to eradicate poverty. "There is no doubt that we can easily sustain seven percent growth and by the turn of the century we can achieve eight percent growth," Chidambaram told a meeting of business leaders in the capital. In the 1996/97 fiscal year that ended on March 31, India's gross domestic product grew by 6.8 percent. Over the past three fiscal years, average annual GDP growth has been seven percent, up from about 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, and 5.5 percent in the 1980s, he said. The finance minister said that despite the strengthening of India's growth since free-market economic reforms were launched in 1991, some continued to hold the belief that a more robust economy, particularly industry, will not alleviate poverty. "In the past year and a half, the debate about liberalisation has acquired a very sharp edge," he said. Chidambaram cited "very sharp differences" within Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's 15-party centre-left coalition which ranges from free traders like himself to communists. "A lot of well-meaning people genuinely believe that growth, particularly growth led by industry, will not abolish poverty in this country," he said. "I don't share this diagnosis. Unless we meet this argument, it will be difficult to move forward." Citing Thailand and Malaysia, Chidambaram said other countries had abolished poverty in far fewer than the 50-year period during which India has been independent. Chidambaram called on industry to help convince the nation liberalisation will spur growth and wipe out poverty by 2020. "We can do that only by accelerating growth," he said, adding that China had proved that a country can maintain a double-digit economic growth rate with low inflation. "The higher growth, the higher capacity the government has to appropriate money to make a frontal attack on poverty." The finance minister said the government needed to press ahead with removing controls over agriculture, services including insurance, and industry. "We need to deregulate sectors that are highly regulated," he said. "I am confident that we will inject a measure of competition into the services sector, including insurance," he said, noting that the government recently failed to muster enough support in parliament to defeat a measure that would bar foreign insurers. Chidambaram said sectors which continued to be highly regulated -- coal, power, petroleum, roads -- performed poorly in 1996/97. "We must continue de-monopolisation for higher productivity," he said. The finance minister said poverty could be eradicated if the economy grew at an average of eight percent a year. "At the end of the next 20 years, if we continue to grow at seven to eight percent, we would not only have made India the fourth largest economy in the world, we would have also abolished poverty as we have known it for 5,000 years."
GCAT	Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said on Friday the United Nations had no immediate plans to send an interim peace-keeping force to the Afghan capital Kabul but would continue trying to broker peace. "We are studying the situation now in Kabul and we are thinking about the idea of the demilitarisation of the city," Boutros-Ghali told journalists after presiding over the launch of an international maritime law tribunal in Hamburg. The U.N. would continue to seek ways to demilitarise the city, which the Taleban militia took three weeks ago, but he stressed all warring parties would have to agree to it. Ousted government military commander Ahmad Shah Masood urged the Taleban on Friday to quit Kabul and let the U.N. pave the way for all-party talks on a broad-based government. "Maybe we could be able to send observers there to participate in the ceasefire. But nothing has been decided." Masood made clear the alternative was war. "If the Taleban are not ready to cooperate with us, we cannot avoid fighting," he told Reuters in Jabal os-Siraj near the Salang Pass. Boutros-Ghali said all parties would have to accept a peace-keeping force and the Security Council would have to approve it and earmark funds for it. "For the time being our action must be more a diplomatic action than a military or a paramilitary action," he said. The U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, German diplomat Norbert Holl, has been negotiating with the different parties since the Taleban seized the capital on September 27. Taleban fighters brought a measure of peace to areas under its control, but it imposed a fundamentalist version of Islamic observance at variance with Afghanistan's traditionally easy-going Moslem culture. A Taleban evacuation of Kabul has been floated at the United Nations. The United States called it "probably premature", although State Department spokesman Nicholas Burms said a proposal to demilitarise Kabul was "an important idea". There was no immediate reaction from the Taleban on Friday, the Moslem day of rest, but they rejected the earlier Masood ultimatum and vowed to defend Kabul.

GCAT	The Urawa Red Diamonds of Japan's J.League are in contract negotiations with former England captain and Arsenal midfielder David Platt, a team spokesman said on Thursday. "We are in negotiations with Mr. Platt and hope to reach an agreement to enable him to join the team before the July 30 start of the second stage of the 1997 season," the spokesman said by telephone. He declined to discuss possible contract terms or say when the negotiations began. The Red Diamonds, based in the Tokyo suburb of Urawa, were tied for 10th place in the 17-team J.League after the first stage, which ended on Sunday. Platt joined Arsenal for 4.75 million pounds ($7.74 million) from Italy's Sampdoria in 1995. ($1.63=one pound)
GCAT	Kabul's Taleban rulers gathered about 500 civil servants and residents to stage a protest against what they called foreign interference by neighbours on Thursday. The protesters, who marched more than one mile (km) through the city centre to the Iranian embassy and the U.N. political office in Kabul, slammed Russia, Iran and India as the main culprits. "Death to interventionists! Down with Iran and Russia!" chanted a Taleban preacher, standing on a car roof, through a megaphone.   It was the first such demonstration under the Taleban administration in Kabul, and was clearly staged with its blessing. Armed Taleban fighters guarded the procession and were often the only ones shouting slogans through most of the march. Very few of the other marchers seemed enthusiastic or echoed the slogans. Among them was a group of 30 women and children, one of whom said that the Taleban movement should lift its restrictions on work and education for women. "We ask the Taleban to provide education and job opportunities for women of Afghanistan," said the burkha-clad woman, who taught for 40 years in Kabul until the Taleban takeover last month. Some said they had been summoned for a morning meeting and then had been told to join the march. "It is like a spontaneous demonstration. We didn't know anything about it," one participant said.

GCAT	German police said on Tuesday they had searched 10 apartments belonging to Algerian nationals suspected of possessing explosives in four German cities in raids coordinated with French police. A spokeswoman for the German Federal Prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said the apartments were searched because authorities suspected the Algerians of acquiring explosive materials for Algeria's rebel Armed Islamic Group (GIA) "The federal prosecutor's office is investigating Algerian nationals who are suspected of acquiring explosives for the GIA," said spokeswoman Eva Schuebel. But she said no explosive materials were found in the raid, which was closely coordinated with police in France. One person was arrested for an unrelated matter, she said. The German raids took place in Cologne, Offenbach, Frankfurt and Wiesbaden. Meanwhile, French anti-terrorist police detained 22 suspected Islamic militants in dawn raids in the Paris area, eastern France and the Riviera on Tuesday, the French interior ministry said.
MCAT	Premiums for European Union (EU) white sugars have remained at low levels so far this year despite steady pre-Ramadan buying by Middle East consumers and a number of tenders, physical brokers said on Friday. "The premiums are quite low and EUs are having to compete with sugars that are not of the same quality. There are fewer quality homes," said one broker. EU sugars were quoted at $3/6 bid/offer over March futures for February/March cargoes from northern Europe's four main ports, broadly the same as a few weeks ago. Premiums were not vastly different for further forward months, sources said. One broker quoted a January cargo at a $2 premium. Middle East buyers have been active over the past month, with Iran importing 45 ICUMSA whites and also raws for refining. Traders said Iran bought one cargo of Feb/March whites at a reported price of $306 per tonne this week, another for March at $303.25 and 30,000 tonnes of February raws at $264. Syria and Libya both issued buying tenders this week, while Algeria and Morocco have been importing raw sugar. But a number of bearish factors have combined to put a lid on any rise in EU premiums, market sources said. "The Indian and Turkish sugar that is being put on the market obviously helps to put a dampener on the whole thing," said one. Traders cited the gradual release of India's massive stocks onto the market, coupled with Turkey's recent tender to sell 50,000 tonnes of whites. The new Middle East refineries are also poised to carve out a hefty portion of the EU's market base in the region. So supply of quality sugar should not be a problem in the future, especially as the EU is forecast to turn in a good 1996/97 crop. Turkey agreed with Iran in December to sell it 50,000 tonnes of sugar and later said the amount could be raised if necessary. Last month, Turkey said it was told by a senior delegation from Tehran that Iran needed to buy about 600,000 tonnes of sugar this year, some of which could come from Turkey. Local Turkish companies are reported to have bought the offered sugar and possibly sell it on to Iran, further undercutting European producers. "They've taken away a bit of the (EU's) export market," a trader said. Other London traders said they expected Turkey to issue more selling tenders as it moved to rid itself of unwanted stocks, because a high beet support price removed the need to hold high strategic stocks. "They're talking a lot about de-stocking some of their sugar so we may see another couple of selling tenders from there," the broker said. Latin American cane producers such as Mexico are also turning out white sugar but much of this is thought to be destined for west African buyers, who are importing higher quality sugars. "Mexico whites are mainly 45 (ICUMSA) plus some other stuff...it's going into west Africa, Colombo and so on," said another physical trader. "But EU freight rates are working relatively competitively too in west Africa," she said. Traders quoted Mexican 45 ICUMSA cargoes at a $2 discount to London futures after a $10 discount around a month ago. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8064
ECAT	U.S. Trade Representative nominee Charlene Barshefsky said Wednesday that without "fast-track" negotiating authority, it would be difficult for the United States to get a free trade agreement with Chile. Barshefsky told the Senate Finance Committee a trade pact with Chile had been a goal of several U.S. administrations, but it would be hard without fast-track authority which allows a straight up-or-down vote on the pact in Congress.   "The Chileans have also made it clear that in the absence of fast track, it is very difficult for them to take the very hard decisions to open their markets in certain ways," she said. "I think the absence of fast track leaves a vacuum in our own hemisphere with respect to leadership and with respect to the rules of trade in our hemisphere," Barshefsky said. "What the absence has done has been to lead to an agglomeration by other countries of other trading partners in our own hemisphere, as a means of building their own little unit or system of rules and obligations," she added.

ECAT	California's unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.8 percent in January, according to a state report Friday. The number of people employed in California increased by 88,000 over the month and rose 368,000 compared with year ago figures, the state Employment Development Department reported. "Not even the most optimistic economic forecasters would have predicted a year ago that we would see 400,000 new jobs created over 12 months," Gov. Pete Wilson said in a statement. "The results have clearly surpassed our best expectations."   Motion picture production added 24,800 jobs in the state since January of 1996, a 23.3 percent increase. The construction industry gained 7,400 jobs in January and 34,000 over the past 12 months, the Employment Development Department reported.
MCAT	Malaysian and Indonesian buyers will probably jump into the market after the overnight release of a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report which sent corn futures prices soaring, dealers said on Wednesday. The USDA estimated on Tuesday that U.S. 1997 corn production would be around 9.276 billion bushels, sharply below its forecast of 9.7 billion in July. The September corn futures contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) closed the 12-cent limit up, ending at US$2.61-3/4 a bushel. December was also up 12 cents at $2.65-1/4 a bushel.   "I was very surprised by the numbers. It's already spooked buyers here," a dealer for a U.S. commodity house told Reuters. "Everybody was surprised. I don't think people can hold back on buying too long. We're a long way from the next crop report and we're coming into September when they have to make decisions on their last quarter needs," anther dealer said. Prices of U.S. corn coming into Southeast Asia rose sharply and were seen by the trade at around $145-$150 a tonne C&F on a Panamax for October-December shipment against a quote last week of $138-$142 a tonne C&F.   One analyst was a bit more cautious about buyers chasing corn supplies, saying they would probably come in if prices dipped. "I don't think consumers are going to run and go crazy. I would be surprised to see people chasing corn," he said. But most of the trade believes otherwise. "This thing will scare people. It will definitely spook the buyers," one said.   Traders said Indonesia, which recently bought around 150,000 tonnes of corn mostly from China for September delivery, may need to buy another 250,000 tonnes because of a drought which appears to have blighted the crop on Java. The crop has taken a pounding from dry conditions believed precipitated by the El Nino weather phenomenon. "The Indonesians are already looking at new crop corn. If they start buying, that would be the number they're looking at -- 200,000 to 250,000 tonnes," one dealer said.   Malaysian feedmills will also be looking to pick up an estimated 100,000 tonnes of corn for September-November delivery and a further 150,000 tonnes for December. "The 100,000 tonnes for September to November is the minimum the Malaysians will need. I think it will be more than that," a dealer said. "The Malaysians are not going to be happy about this. They should be buying soon," a trader added. Thailand, on the other hand, is believed to be close to securing most of the 150,000 tonnes of duty-free corn the government has allowed into the country.   "Their corn harvest is coming in so they will not probably need any new shipments immediately," one trader said. One grains analyst said buyers in Malaysia and Indonesia would try to get Chinese corn, although supplies from there are seen drying up towards the end of the year. "For November-December, they will have to look at U.S. corn," a dealer said. A drought in China would also curb its corn exports going into next year, he added. In the oilseeds business, bearish USDA numbers and expectations of a bumper soybean harvest in the U.S. drove buyers to the sidelines.   The USDA forecast a record soybean crop of 2.744 billion bushels, up from from trade expectations of 2.607-2.731 billion. "I'm pretty comfortable with the bean number. The rain is there, the plants are fine. I think it's (the soybean crop) going to be bigger," a dealer said. "The buyers will say the USDA figures is bearish and ask for really low prices," another trader said. "They can sit back and wait for prices to come closer to their level." -- Singapore Newsroom (65) 870-3080; Fax (65) 776-8112 -- Email: singapore.newsroom@reuters.com
CCAT	Telco Communications Group Inc., one of 10 largest U.S. long distance companies, said Tuesday it has a definitive agreement to acquire the voice network assets of Advantis for about $170 million cash. The assets include about 100,000 network miles of fiber optic capacity, five Nortel switches, and other ancillary network equipment. Telco, based in Chantilly, Va., said the switches can support its move into the local phone service market. The company said it expects the deal to close in mid-April and that it will boost earnings per share slightly for 1997. Advantis, based in Schaumburg, Ill., is a partnership of International Business Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck & Co. Telco's stock fell 37.5 cents to $18.25 on Nasdaq.
MCAT	CSCE coffee futures shot up on Wednesday, surging to fresh contract highs across-the-board, as speculators bought heavily on near-term supply concerns, traders said. A prolonged dock workers' strike in Colombia and continued speculation about the size of the Brazilian crop exacerbated supply worries in the U.S., where coffee inventories are already at extremely low levels. "This is still a reflection of underlying bullishness linked to a tight situation," said Dean Witter analyst Steve Platt. "It will persist if the the Brazil crop comes in lower as most people suggest." CSCE March delivery jumped to a new life-of-contract high of 137.05 cents a lb before settling at 135.30 cents a lb, up 5.65 cents -- or more than four pecent -- on the day. On the continuous weekly chart, March's finish was the highest since September 1995. Second-position May ended up 4.85 cents, to 130.85 cents, while the outer months closed 3.75 to 4.75 cents higher. Volume was heavy, at an estimated 15,897 lots. After posting gains seven sessions in row, traders said today's rally was sparked by a report from Wall Street firm Merrill Lynch suggesting the tight supply situation could drive prices to as high as 200.00 cents a lb by mid-1997. The report said aggressive purchasing by European roasters had absorbed the new crop supply of coffee and caused U.S. inventories to dwindle. "Total supplies have not been this tight in 20 years," the report said. "Although it is hard to prove statistically, we believe arabica supplies might be the tightest on record." Merrill Lynch said the market outlook hinged on the Brazilian 1997/98 coffee harvest and the response of the Brazilian government to release holdings should the crop be reduced. Preliminary forecasts by the Brazilian government have pegged the country's 1997/98 coffee crop between 18 million and 20 million 60-kg bags compared with an estimated 25 million bags the previous season. "We have a balanced situation with a larger Brazilian crop," Dean Witter's Platt said. "With a smaller crop, you are looking at an explosive situation." Traders said other factors, such as the port strike at the Colombian port of Buenaventura and uncertainty ahead of a meeting Thursday of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries meeting in Rio de Janeiro, also underpinned the market. Dock workers will resume talks with government officials and cargo handling operators to resolve the strike this afternoon. The work stoppage, which entered its eighth day, has blocked shipment of more than 300,000 60-kg bags of coffee exports. ((--Patricia Avidan, New York Commodities Desk +1 212 859 1640))
CCAT	The U.S. sugar confectionery market has slowly convinced consumers of its advantages over chocolate by using products low in fat and sugar, management consultant Datamonitor said. "Sugar confectionery manufacturers have seen the future and it is low fat," it said in a statement issued on Monday. Citing its new report "U.S. confectionery 1997", Datamonitor said sugar confectionery had increased its market share partly because the chocolate category was regarded unfavourably from a health standpoint. It had also been been slow to react to the burgeoning low fat market, the statement said. While chocolate still accounted for the lion's share of the confectionery market at around 60 percent, the approximate 20-percent share of sugar-based products had gradually risen since 1992, a Datamonitor chart showed. Gum accounted for most of the remaining share. Sugar confectioners had developed new products to cater for the health market while the chocolate category lacked low-fat products, thus presenting producers with the problem of balancing taste and content, it said. Datamonitor noted that four manufacturers -- Hershey Foods Corp, M&M/Mars, Nestle SA and Brach -- controlled more than 75 percent of the U.S. confectionery market and were keeping private label sales to a minimum. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8064

GCAT	The leader of Turkey's militant separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) said in interview excerpts broadcast on Friday that he was calling an end to violent protests in Germany. The PKK has staged a number of violent rallies in Germany to support its cause, most recently in March, when hundreds of people were arrested. Authorities blame it for many dozens of attacks on Turkish property in Germany, where Kurds make up just under a fifth of the 2.2 million-strong Turkish population. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan told national ZDF television: "Even if the differences between us and the German government are very big, we will no longer use violence in Germany...We have told our organisation and supporters." Ocalan has made similar announcements in the past via German media, only for the PKK to lapse back into violence, accusing Germany of supporting Turkey's action against the Kurds. However, there have been no major incidents since May, when Ocalan said he regretted the March riots and suggested Germany could mediate between Turkey and the Kurds. The PKK, fighting a 12-year-old guerrilla war against Ankara for autonomy in southeast Turkey, has been banned in Germany since coordinating violence in dozens of cities in 1993. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's security services coordinator, Bernd Schmidbauer, welcomed Ocalan's remarks. "We take seriously such comments, which are new in this form and clarity," he told ZDF. But he added: "We have heard such signals in the past. We will be keeping a close watch in this." ZDF broadcast excerpts of the interviews in a news bulletin on Friday and said it would transmit the full interviews on Sunday.
MCAT	Greek equities settled 0.64 percent higher on Wednesday on moderate volume with construction shares gaining 4.97 percent recovering from oversold levels, market watchers said. They expected buying interest to continue to be limited in view of the Greek Orthodox Easter holidays. The Greek bourse will be closed on Friday and Monday. "The market is neutral in view of the Easter holidays. The general share index will continue to trade at current levels for the next couple of weeks," said analyst Vassilis Kletsas, at Telesis Securities. Investors are awaiting the release of preliminary forecasts on such macroeconomic figures as inflation and state revenues, usually released at the end of the month, he added. "The construction sector has underperformed up to now. Its stocks were oversold and because people are turning away from banks, we saw construction shares jump towards the end of the session," he said. The Athens general share index ended 0.64 percent or 9.22 points higher on Wednesday, at 1,442.19, after opening at 1433.08. It had closed at 1,432.97 on Tuesday. The session's high was at 1,433.15 points. Turnover was 14.0 billion drachmas on 4.5 million shares traded. Advancers led decliners 149 to 71, with 20 stocks unchanged on 240 traded. There were block trades in Alpha Credit, Macedonia-Thrace Bank, Dias and Aluminium of Greece. Sectoral indices were mixed. Constructrion shares led, climbing 4.97 percent.

MCAT	Dealers said the most direct comparison for today's deal was the 10-year bond Argentina issued in March at 475 b.p. over Bunds which has since tightened to 410 b.p. over. Only Argentina's small, illiquid September 2003 deal was in line with today's spread, they aded. A syndicate manager at CSFB countered: "Argentina has got an unparalleled franchise in the mark sector. They've established a curve this year and have a following in Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux." DMG reported good initial response from its regular outlets for Argentina paper.   Last week Argentina tapped international markets with a 600 billion lire 10-year financing and a 50 billion yen six-year Samurai transaction. The deals came after comments in early November by Argentine finance secretary Pablo Guidotti that it was considering issuing up to $2.0 billion in bonds this year to finance 1997 spending.

ECAT	Australia's small business sector is at its lowest point in four years, with trading conditions steady but flat, unchanged since June 1995, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants (CPA) said. The CPA said its CPA Small Business Health Index was at its lowest point in 15 quarters since the index began in April 1993. The index, which tracks the health of small business, also showed that the big four banks continued to make healthy returns from small business lending, handling 74 percent of small business loans, the CPA said.   The index has dropped to 103.6 for the December 1996 quarter, down from the previous low of 104.1 in June 1995 and down from the September 1996 quarter of 106 points. The CPA said that for only the second time since the index started, the 450 businesses surveyed reported a worsening in their performance during the quarter. It said the survey showed the average rate of interest paid by the 63 percent who said they had borrowings was 11 percent, three to four percentage points above the current home mortgage rates. About 37 percent of those surveyed said they had no loans or no interest payments, it said.   The CPA said that most borroweres were paying interest of 11.25 percent despite Reserve Bank of Australia data for December which indicated that the mean variable rate available to small business was 10.25 percent. CPA national president Scott Henderson said in a statement that the ongoing economic flatness was becoming entrenched. "As long as people are living with job insecuity they won't spend," Henderson said.   "Unemployment figures haven't changed and the government appears reluctant to deal with interest rates. In these continuing circumstances, small business is disinclined to invest and employ," Henderson said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

MCAT	The dollar started trading on Monday off its overnight lows but still down from levels seen in Europe late on Friday, with attention in Europe focused on cross trading after the first round of the French election. Dealers said the mark was stronger overall due to concern about the sharp swing to the left in the first round of the vote in France. With most votes counted in metropolitan France, the Interior Ministry said the combined left had polled 40.1 percent, the RPR-UDF coalition and other right-wing candidates 36.5 percent and the National Front 15 percent.   Most of the 577 National Assembly seats were set to go to a run-off, where the behaviour of Front supporters and of the 31.6 percent of voters who abstained will be crucial. The franc weakened by as much as five pfennigs on the news, but stabilised to around 29.62 marks per 100 francs in morning trade. Dealers warned, howevver, that there could be a larger sell-off if next week's poll confirmed the trend to the left. "If this trend is confirmed next week then it would signal the euro is in danger," one trader at a German bank said, adding that the natural response would be a firmer mark.   Trade on the dollar was quiet, with volumes thinned by holidays today in Britain and the United States. "It is likely to remain quiet today," one trader said. The dollar was trading at 1.6853/63 marks at 0825 GMT after bouncing off overnight lows of 1.6770/80 marks. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525

MCAT	NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures ended lower Thursday in an active session, pressured by a deteriorating technical picture and eroding cash prices amid mostly-mild U.S. weather, industry sources said. November tumbled nine cents to close at $2.485 per million British thermal units. December settled 12 cents lower at $2.556. Other deferreds ended down by 3.5 to 12.1 cents. "Natgas is becoming a weather play, and right now, warmer temperatures are expected and there's not going to be any load in the Northeast," said one Midwest trader, noting physical prices lost more than a dime today.   Traders said forecasts calling for mostly seasonal to above-seasonal U.S. weather into early November set a bearish tone ahead of bidweek next week. And with reports of some East Coast utilities already turning back gas, few expected much upside in cash or futures near-term though most agreed the approach of an uncertain winter should temper the bears. Technically, traders noted December settled below the near-term up trendline, making a move to next support in the $2.46-47 area likely. Resistance was seen at the recent $2.76 high. Cash sources said Gulf Coast prices skidded almost a dime Thursday to about the $2.50 level. Midcon pipes were down a similar amount to the mid-$2.30s. New York city gate gas prices, pressured by mild East Coast weather, fell about 15 cents to the low-$2.80 area. The 12-month Henry Hub strip fell 7.8 cents to $2.207.

GCAT	Belgian police made their twelfth arrest on Tuesday in the scandal of child abduction, sexual abuse and murder that has shaken the country to the core. Marleen De Cockere was charged with criminal association and drug trafficking. Belga news agency said she was also implicated in the illegal imprisonment of children. De Cockere is the companion of Jean-Michel Nihoul who has been under arrest since August 16 on charges of criminal association. Nihoul, whose lawyer admits he takes part in orgies with consenting adults, has since also been charged with abduction. Belgium has been in shock since August 16 when the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo were found on a property owned by convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux in Sars-La-Buissiere near the southern city of Charleroi. The two children had been kidnapped by associates of Dutroux 14 months earlier. He said they starved to death around the start of this year. The discovery followed the rescue of two other girls -- Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, -- from a secret dungeon in another house owned by Dutroux in Marcinelle, a suburb of Charleroi. On Friday Belgian television showed the first pictures of the one metre by three metres (three feet by nine feet) dungeon in which Julie and Melissa died, hidden behind a heavy, soundproofed steel and concrete door set in the wall in the basement. Two more teenagers -- Eefje Lambrecks and An Marchal -- were found dead two and a half weeks later at the home of Frenchman Bernard Weinstein, an accomplice whom Dutroux admits killing. Belgian television said several people had been questioned on Tuesday. Dutroux, who was also involved in an international car theft ring, and accomplice Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment. Dutroux's second wife Michelle Martin has been charged as an accomplice. Three other people have been charged in relation to the child sex and pornography ring -- including Annie Bouty, a former companion of Nihoul. Four others -- including Georges Zicot, a chief detective specialising in tackling car theft -- have been charged in connection with the stolen cars. All but two of the 12 are being held in custody while investigations continue.
GCAT	Ernie Els won a nerve-wracking war of attrition at Congressional Country Club on Sunday, overcoming three determined rivals on the final holes to win his second U.S. Open golf championship. The broad-shouldered South African made a string of six successive pressure-packed pars after taking the lead with a birdie at the 12th hole that broke a four-way tie for the lead. Els, who won the 1994 U.S. Open in a three-way playoff at Oakmont Country Club, finished the day with a one-under-par 69 for a winning total of four-under 276. Briton Colin Montgomerie finished second, one stroke back. The burly Scot, who also competed in the Oakmont playoff, was tied with Els until he bogeyed the par-4 17th, missing a five-foot putt for par. Tom Lehman, the reigning British Open champion, was third at two-under. He fell back after posting bogeys at 16 and 17 as he fired at flags in search of a birdie. Jeff Maggert, the last member of the battling quartet, finished poorly after falling behind Els and ended up one over par after being within one shot through 15 holes. "It was great competition out there today. It was really tough," said the 27-year-old Els. "I'm unbelievably delighted." Els earned $465,000 for the victory.

CCAT	Revenues of China's railways soared by 20 percent last year although the number of passengers declined, the official Xinhua news agency said on Thursday. Revenues could continue to rise this year, spurred partly by huge fare increases, but the number of travellers on the sprawling rail network was expected to decline further, it said. Rail transport generated revenues of 75.6 billion yuan ($9.1 billion) last year, up by nearly 20 percent compared with 1995, it said. The figure is expected to rise to 78.5 billion yuan ($8.8 billlion) in 1997, Xinhua said. Xinhua attributed the increase in revenues to a fare hikje of nearly 50 percent last year. However, the number of passengers was falling, with China's trains carrying 942 million passengers in 1996, down by 12.3 percent from 1995, it said. More Chinese were choosing to travel by air, bus or waterways because these were either faster or cheaper. About 920 million people would travel by rail in 1997, Xinhua quoted figures issued by the Railway Minstry as showing. Rail freight was expected to be 1.61-1.62 billion tonnes in 1997, compared to 1.62 billion tonnes in 1996, a rise of 1.4 percent compared with the previous year, it said.
ECAT	The Bank of England said it continued to see the need for a moderate tightening of monetary policy to ensure the government's 2.5 percent inflation target can be met two years ahead. "The Bank's central projection for inflation two years ahead is close to three percent and rising," it said in its quarterly Inflation Report. "In the near term, the rise in the exchange rate leads to a fall in the central projection because of lower import prices. But monetary policy must look beyond these short-term effects and ensure that underlying inflation is consistent with the target." "In the light of the central projection and the risks surrounding it, the Bank continues to see the need for a moderate tightening of policy." The report did not specify how big a rate increase the Bank would like to see. But deputy governor Howard Davies said on Tuesday the Bank favoured an early quarter-point rise from the present 6.0 percent, perhaps followed by another rise later this year. The Bank's chief economist Mervyn King told a news conference that the longer the delay in raising interest rates, the greater the increase would have to be to achieve the same effect. The Bank said that in recent months, there had been little sign of any further acceleration of demand. "But the case for some tightening in policy does not depend upon a further acceleration. The growth rates of money and demand that have been seen for some time now cannot be sustained for long if the inflation target is to be met two years or so ahead,"it added.   It was now more likely that 12-month RPIX inflation (the underlying rate which excludes mortgage interest payments) would fall below 2.5 percent some time this year. "The central projection for inflation in two years time is close to that made in November: the adverse effect of lower net external demand is balanced by slightly higher domestic demand and the reversal of some of the earlier falls in import prices," the Bank said. The uncertainty surrounding the central projection was slightly greater than in November. "The risks are a little skewed towards the upside. That reflects the risks around the outlook for final domestic demand -- the chances of consumption and investment growing more rapidly than in the central case are higher than the chances of slower growth." "The uncertainty about the speed of pass-through from the exchange rate to retail prices has increased the risks in the near term in particular, simply because the change in the exchange rate since last summer is larger," the Bank added. The report said both demand and output were now growing at above-trend rates. The picture had been complicated by the appreciation of sterling, which would lead to a fall in inflation in the short term as import prices fell. "But that is primarily a one-off impact on the domestic price level," the Bank said. "The rise in sterling will also lead to a deterioration in net trade performance." It said the yield curve at the short end had already moved up, anticipating a rise in official interest rates and helping to moderate the expansion of demand. "If official rates do not rise, the yield curve will fall back, further stimulating the growth of domestic demand," the Bank added. -- Richard Murphy, London Newsroom 44 171 542 2774

ECAT	A man walks through a crowd. He looks entirely ordinary. A heartbeat quickens and gets louder. The cross-hairs of a telescopic sight zero in on him. "The choice is yours," a voice rumbles. "File your return." There was no mistaking the message of the advertisement on Russian television on Monday. The taxman has you in his sights. It was the latest in an intimidating series of spots as the March 31 deadline arrived for Russians to file 1996 tax returns. The campaign also has hair-raising footage of the heavily armed Tax Police in action -- Kalashnikovs and tear gas grenades are in this year, brown suits and briefcases are out. It seems to have worked, as more people filed returns. But all the evidence points to evasion on a grand scale, leaving the cash-hungry government with a headache that will not go away. "We've had about twice as many returns as last year," said Lidia Grin, head of Tax Inspectorate No. 30 in western Moscow. "It's been better organised this year. The media campaign has made people aware of their obligations," she said. National forecasts mirror that trend. The central tax office said it expected more than five and half million returns -- about double the 2.8 million a year ago. That is good news for the government, which has made recovering taxes a priority after blaming persistent revenue shortfalls for the long delays in pensions and wages that sparked nationwide street protests last Thursday. Yet it is not very good news. It still means millions of Russians, the vast majority in fact, are dodging their taxes. True, many of the country's 100 million odd adults earn less than 12 million roubles ($2,100) a year, above which they must file a return. Officially, the average wage is about $1,500. But few Russians doubt nearly everyone fiddles the system. "It's nice to feel we are seeing results," Grin said. "But we still have a lot of work to do. We've learned a lot from the Americans. But our system is only six years old, not 60." The size of her task is daunting. There are about 40,000 working people in her area, but she expects just 2,000 returns. And with just a dozen or so tax inspectors, the other 38,000 citizens have relatively little chance of being caught. So why bother? The answers along lengthy lines on Monday were similar: a little bit of tax buys a lot of peace of mind. "I want to sleep at nights," said 59-year-old Alexander, a research scientist, filing a return for the first time. He was to pay 260,000 roubles ($45) on a declared 1996 income of 19 million ($3,330). The last time he paid tax was in 1990. "It saves time," said Arkady Ivanov, another scientist and first-time filer. "Doing it now means no more hassle later." "If you can get away with not paying, good luck to you," said 34-year-old lawyer Alexander, who has several jobs. "If not you're in trouble. It's better to file a declaration." Few people anywhere like paying taxes. But there is a degree of bitterness and resistance in Russia that goes beyond that, due mostly to the perception that they get nothing in return. Public employees like teachers and doctors are still getting tax demands on salaries the state has failed to pay for months. "Taxes are a waste of money," Alexander said. "The country's falling apart and people in need get nothing. I'd prefer to give them something directly. So, let's say, I 'minimise' my taxes."
MCAT	IPE gas oil futures closed 75 cents down on Monday as negative sentiment overtook the market amid talk that Iraqi crude exports were closer to resuming, brokers said. The July gas oil contract, which expires on Thursday, finished at $161.25 a tonne, three dollars off its intra-day high and nudging significant support around $160-$160.50. IPE Brent was drifting sideways and was down three cents at $18.03 a barrel at 1749 GMT. In New York the front-month WTI contract was at $19.33, down 23 cents on talk that Iraq was due to meet U.N. officials on the details of its aid plan.   "We saw some good end-user buying in the morning on the gas oil but then things slumped and we're at the bottom end of the range," said one broker. IPE Brent business was described as featureless, having slipped into negative territory from its intra-day high of $18.28 a barrel reached on short covering. "We're just drifting, there is nothing happening out there," said one broker. Dealers in New York said prices were weaker because a sell-off last week broke key trendlines throughout the oil complex and generated sell signals on Monday.
GCAT	U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her South Korean counterpart confirmed on Saturday that preliminary peace talks with North Korea would take place next month in New York. Albright and South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong told a news conference in Seoul that their governments had agreed to meet North Korean representatives on March 5 to discuss a proposal for four-party talks including China to work for a lasting peace on the divided peninsula. They spoke after several hours of talks held against the backdrop of dramatic changes in the reclusive North Korean leadership. Earlier in the day Pyongyang announced the death of its powerful defence minister, Choe Kwang. He was the third top official to disappear from the Stalinist state's ruling hierarchy in 10 days following the defection of a leading ideologue to the South on February 12 and Friday's news that premier Kang Song-san was being replaced. South Korean officials believe the changes will lead to a major shake-up in Pyongyang's ruling elite at a time of heightened tensions on the peninsula. At Saturday's news conference Yoo described the North Korean situation as "volatile", adding: "We have to avoid any active and armed clashes" between the two sides. Albright, who had earlier flown to Seoul after a whirlwind tour of major European capitals, told the conference: "I am pleased to announce that we have agreed with North Korea on a joint Republic of Korea-U.S. briefing about our presidents' proposal to conduct four-party peace talks which will take place on March 5 in New York." North Korea had announced the "briefing" plans on Friday but U.S. officials refused to confirm the meeting until after Albright's talks in Seoul with President Kim Young-sam and Yoo. U.S. and South Korean officials were burned twice before when Pyongyang scheduled and then cancelled the briefing, deemed a necessary preliminary step to substantive peace talks. A senior U.S. official acknowledged there was no certainty the North Koreans would attend this time until they actually showed up in New York. But he said that previously, Pyongyang had played "hard to get" on the briefing issue and this time "they acknowledge they want to come to this meeting". Albright and Yoo also reaffirmed support for the 1994 agreement under which Washington and Seoul would provide $5 billion in light-water nuclear reactors to North Korea in return for Pyongyang freezing its nuclear programme. Yoo said North Korea's desire to improve its devastated Stalinist economy was the "most obvious answer" to why Pyongang had now agreed to attend the New York briefing. The New York Times in an editorial on Saturday accused South Korea of deliberately fanning tensions with North Korea. The senior official said he did not agree. When North Korea announced on Friday that it would attend the briefing, some analysts saw it as a sign the communist North was trying to put on a normal face after the embarrassing defection of top ideologue Hwang Jang-yop, currently hol;ed up in Seoul's Beijing mission. North Korea had twice in the past month put off attending a peace talks "briefing" in what was seen as an effort to press Washington to provide more food aid for its hungry population. Washington insists it never promised Pyongyang a specific amount of food aid in return for the Stalinist regime's participation in the briefing. Pyongyang reneged on its promise to attend earlier briefings when it was unable to close on a deal with U.S.-based Cargill Inc. on 500,000 tonnes of grain. That deal still has not been completed. This week, however, the United States and South Korea acted to alleviate the North's food needs by pledging $10 million and $6 million in new assistance, respectively, through the World Food Programme, a United Nations agency. Washington and Seoul proposed the four-way talks last April to defuse tensions -- and eventually bring about a permanent peace -- on the peninsula. The two Koreas remain technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace pact. Asked if North Korea was manipulating the United States and South Korea with its erratic behaviour, Albright said: "I believe no country plans a famine and to be the beggar on the international stage." Yoo said South Korea's food shortage is "one of the important issues that we are dealing with". Once Pyongyang came to the peace talks, he added, serious discussions about larger food assistance could take place. After her talks with Yoo and President Kim Young-sam, Albright was due to visit the demilitarised zone between North and South, where 37,000 U.S. troops help keep the uneasy peace.

CCAT	Waterford Wedgwood is expected to announce a 30 percent rise in pre-tax profits to around 9.5 million Irish pounds when it reports half-year results on Wednesday, analysts said. Boosted by an improved performance in the UK following the purchase of Stuart & Sons Limited for 4.24 million stg in August 1995, the crystal and china firm is forecast to show earnings per share of between 1.0 and 1.1 Irish pence. "The acquisition of Stuart has worked out pretty well for the company," said Joe Burnell, analyst at Davy Stockbrokers.   Burnell forcasts a pre-tax profit of 9.5 million Irish pounds and earnings per share (EPS) of 1.0 pence for the six months to June 30. He said operating profit for the interim period should be 11.5 million Irish pounds with the Wedgwood china division accounting for 6.5 million punts of that sum. Goodbody's Dick Watson also expects a pre-tax profit of 9.5 million Irish pounds and looks for EPS of 1.1 pence. Watson forecasts an operating profit of 11.5 million punts for the six months leading to an operating profit of 40 million punts at year-end.   This compares with a pre-tax profit of 7.4 million punts, earnings per share of 0.82 pence and an operating profit of 10.1 million punts in the same period last year. "The first-half of the year is always seasonally lower than the second-half when cash-flow improves profitability," said Watson. Analysts forecast that the Waterford crystal division of the business will have performed better than the Wedgwood china division over the first six months of 1996. "We expect to see Waterford perform that bit better, partly down to the acquisition of Stuart," Burnell said.   "Waterford will also benefit from increased spending on product development, continued cost-cutting and the introduction of a new tank furnace," he added. Watson said the company had made some progress toward achieving its target of 15 percent margins. Margins were 12.6 percent in 1995. "There is a bit to go but they are getting near it," he said. "They are certainly much nearer achieving their target with Waterford than they are with Wedgwood." -- Dublin Newsroom +353 1 6603377

CCAT	Times Mirror Co said advertising revenues for Times Mirror's Newspaper Publishing Group for the four weeks ended December 31, 1996, fell 10.6 percent to $131,864,000 from $147,509,000 in the prior year. For the 1996 fourth quarter, advertising revenues totaled $434.5 million versus $434.8 million in year ago quarter. The December period and fourth quarter 1996 results reflect five fewer days than the comparable periods in 1995.   In the January period and first quarter 1996, operating results reflected six additional days compared to the comparable 1995 periods, the company said. For the fifty-two weeks January 1, 1996 through December 31, 1996, total advertising revenues rose 1.0 percent to $1,574,450,000 compared with $1,558,157,000 for the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995. The year-to-date results for 1996 contained one more day than the 1995 results.
CCAT	A natural gas tolling deal between NOVA Corp and PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd was hammered out over the last week under the encouragement of Alberta's Energy Minister, a PanCanadian official said on Monday. The deal effectively kills the threat to NOVA of a major pipeline competitor on its its traditional exclusive turf. PanCanadian vice-president Gerry Protti said Alberta Energy Minister Pat Black had made it clear to the parties she wanted a deal reached commercially before the government or regulatory authorities were dragged into the emotional battle.   "That is what we have there," Protti said. PanCanadian and NOVA unit NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd said on Monday they reached an agreement on tolls that should eliminate the need to construct the Palliser pipeline. Under the deal, NOVA would establish a "load-retention rate" of C$0.155 per thousand cubic feet of gas transported on its system for eligible shippers who had executed precedent agreements with the proposed Palliser Pipeline. The proposed rate would increase two percent per year for a 20-year term.   PanCanadian, along with partner Westcoast Energy Inc, had proposed the 1.2 billion cubic feet per day Palliser project because it believed it was paying tolls that were to high to transport its gas to the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. Much of PanCanadian's gas production lies in the southern part of Alberta. But, under a traditional NOVA toll structure called the "postage stamp" rate, it paid the same amount to ship gas to the border as producers in the northernmost regions of the province.   Industry experts said on Monday that it remained to be seen what the response of northern producers would be to the NOVA-PanCanadian deal, which included a stipulation that NOVA would join PanCanadian in reviving Palliser if an application to Alberta's Energy and Utilities Board was unsuccessful. The deal would see the postage stamp rate for other shippers raised by under a cent per thousand cubic feet from the current level of 26 cents. "A penny's a penny, so it sets a precedent," said ScotiaMcleod pipeline analyst Sam Kanes.   "So, this precedent of economic differentials is going to open the box for things changing somewhat." A NOVA official said the agreement could spell the end of NOVA's postage stamp tolls, which had been lauded as responsible for the development of remote gas fields. "To the extent that this opens the door for alternate pricing structures over the long term may well lead to an evolution in the postage stamp tolling methodology," said NOVA vice-president Eric Shelton. NOVA spokesman Paul Clark said the company could offer lower costs to all producers with the deal, something that would have been impossible with Palliser in place. Kanes said the deal was "a mild favorable" for NOVA shareholders because itss core pipeline network would remain whole, assuming there were no challenges to the agreement. Protti, who said the pact was hammered out using the services of a mediator, said he expected PanCanadian to use the funds that had been earmarked for the project on a greatly expanded exploration and production program.

CCAT	The China Construction Bank extended new loans totalling 129 billion yuan in 1996, a rise of 16.8 percent from the previous year and the biggest increase in recent years, the China News Service said on Tuesday. At the end of 1996, the bank's deposits totalled 1.1018 trillion yuan, an increase of 284.1 billion yuan during the year, or a rise of 36.7 percent, it said. The rate of increase in deposits ranked first among China's main state-owned banks, it said. The report attributed the increase in deposits to the bank's strategy to focus its services on large-scale enterpries in big cities. The bank's profits reached 2.76 billion yuan last year, it said but did not explain whether the figure was pre-tax. ($1 = 8.3 yuan) -- Beijing Newsroom (8610) 6532 1921
ECAT	Portugal's budget deficit for January and February rose a year-on-year 34 percent to 142.3 billion escudos, the Finance Ministry said.   The Finance Ministry said in its monthly budget analysis that the January to February period was not directly comparable with the same period last year since the 1996 budget only came into effect from April. During the first quarter of 1996 a supplementary 1995 budget had been in effect.   The deficit excluding interest charges on public debt rose 29 percent in the first two months of this year to 71.5 billion escudos as a result of increased capital transfers. Current revenue rose 19.9 percent to 731.1 billion escudos while current spending rose 20.6 percent to 802.6 billion. -- Lisbon editorial +(351-1) 3538254
CCAT	Like trying to squeeze more juice out of a ripe tomato, Campbell Soup Co. announced Thursday it would buy back stock, cut jobs and expand overseas in efforts to boost profits in the mature food industry. "We are poised for breaking away from our competitors in the food industry," Chairman David W. Johnson said in announcing the initiatives to securities analysts in New York. Campbell said it had authorised $2.5 billion in share repurchases, including a $1.5 billion "dutch auction," was planning to eliminate about 650 jobs, and would buy Erasco Group, the leading canned soup company in Germany. Germany ranks as the largest commercial soup market outside the United States. The announcements came a day after Campbell reported a sixth consecutive year of record sales and earnings. They follow a steady record of cost cutting under Johnson, who took over as Campbell president in 1990 and was named chairman in 1993. The company said it will close or reorganize a number of manufacturing operations across North America, resulting in the elimination of 475 jobs. It will also cut 175 positions at its headquarters in Camden, N.J. "Competition remains fierce," Johnson said, "so we must make strategic moves to maintain our leadership position and to grow Campbell to the next performance level." Campbell's stock was at $72, up $4.50, in late trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday. Analysts said the moves had a good chance to pay off. "The bottom line is that we expect earnings to improve," said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst Tim Ramey, in raising his rating on Campbell's stock to buy from hold. Paine Webber analyst George Staphos said, "They hit on several themes that are important for food companies in terms of how they can control earnings over time." "I think the prospects are good," he said. Analysts said Johnson told a meeting in New York that Campbell aimed to steadily improve earnings while increasing sales growth from recent levels. On Wednesday, Campbell said its profits rose by 15 percent to $802 million for the year ended July 28 as sales expanded by 6 percent to $7.68 billion. "What he (Johnson) would like to see is sales growth on the order of 8 percent," said Fourteen Research analyst Sally Schaadt. Ramey said earnings growth targets appeared to be around 15 percent to 16 percent annually. Campbell said it would consolidate production of Ramen noodles -- closing an operation in Georgia -- sell poultry processing plants, end seasonal production of tomato paste at a plant in Sacramento, Calif., and make other changes to improve asset use. These moves will result in an after-tax charge of about $160 million this fiscal year and will result in savings of $200 million over the next two years, Johnson said. The company will also make a number of product and marketing changes to spur growth, he said. These include a new line of premium ready-to-serve soups, new frozen soups and faster roll-out of the Franco American Superiore range of premium canned pasta products. In addition, Campbell announced plans to increase its advertising spending substantially, mainly for its soups, Pepperidge Farm snacks, V-8 vegetable juice and Swanson frozen foods. Central to Johnson's strategy is his declared aim to move Campbell's financial performance into what he called the "Best of Show" category -- outpacing the entire food industry to perform in the top ranks of branded consumer goods firms. This may be a tall order given the maturity of the industry, Schaadt said. But plans to continue seeking expansion of the soup market -- such as through the introduction of a premium line of soups in glass jars -- indicate that Campbell is thinking along the right lines, she said. "If the market itself can be expanded, he (Johnson) is going to get most of it," she said.

GCAT	At least 14 people including leftist rebels and civilians died in fighting across Colombia, officials said on Wednesday. Counterinsurgency troops killed three members of the National Liberation Army (ELN), the second largest guerrilla force, in two separate clashes in northern Cesar and northwest Antioquia provinces on Tuesday, military sources said. Meanwhile, in eastern Casanare province three insurgents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Colombia's oldest and largest rebel army, died in fighting. In the trouble-torn, banana-growing Uraba region in Antioquia, four peasants were killed by suspected leftist guerrillas, police said. The area has long been the scene of bitter conflicts between rebels and right-wing paramilitary groups battling for control of lucrative contraband routes. Three other peasants were murdered on Tuesday afternoon in unexplained circumstances near the town of Maceo, also in Antioquia province, police said.

ECAT	Saudi Arabia's real deficit in 1996 stood at 17 billion riyals ($4.5 billion), down from a projected 18.5 billion riyals, a Finance Ministry statement said on Monday. The statement said real spending in 1996 was 194 billion riyals, up from the projected 150 billion riyals. Real revenue stood at 177 billion riyals up from the 131.5 billion forecast. It said the rise in expenditure was "mainly due to the measures taken in the year to pay the dues of farmers, contractors and companies...where seven billion riyals were paid to farmers and more than 15 billion riyals were paid to individuals, contractors, importers and other companies." "These measures had boosted confidence in the national economy and were also reflected in the development the kigndom is witnessing in different sectors," the statement said. It was issued by the official media after the announcement of the 1997 budget, which forecast a 17 billion riyals deficit. The arrears had been accumulating since the 1990-91 Gulf war mostly due to the high costs of the war and the weak oil prices, but in the past year, cash payments have been made and special bonds issued to meet the dues. Economists in the kingdom say the government has started meeting current payments on time.
ECAT	South African Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said on Tuesday that the 1996 current account deficit would be well below the 1995 level of 10 billion rand.   "The deficit for 1996 was well below the 1995 level of 10 billion rand," Stals told reporters at a media briefing. "What is more important is to note that the deficit calculated on a seasonally adjusted annualised basis peaked at about 15 billion rand in the second quarter of 1996, before declining to 8.5 billion rand in the third quarter and to a level less than five billion in the fourth quarter of last year," Stals Said.   He said the net inflow of capital from abroad plunged to below five billion rand in 1996 from about 20 billion in 1995, which he said was not enough to cover the current account deficit over the calender year 1996. "The result was that the relatively low level of official gold and foreign exchange reserves came under some pressure, and a very vulnerable situation was exploited by a number of speculative attacks on the rand," Stals said.
MCAT	German Bund futures will add to their recent gains over the next few sessions, feeding off a flurry of debt-positive news released on Thursday. Analysts said data published early in the session confirmed the German economy was staging only a frail recovery, helping back up the Bundesbank's later announcement that it expected no monetary policy change in the foreseeable future. The DTB June future reached an earlier high at 101.13, but had returned to 100.88, up 21 basis points on the day, by 1421 GMT.   With a larger than expected drop in February retail sales figures earlier, and a far weaker March Ifo business climate survey than predicted, some Bund market analysts expressed surprise that the DTB future had not managed to hold its own better. But they said these two factors, combined with the Bundesbank's decision to leave its key rates unchanged at the regular fortnightly council meeting, had helped to underpin the market, ensuring it did not dip below zero for the session. "The market has been a bit of a mixed bag all day," said Robert Eller, a futures broker in at ABN Cicorp in London.   "The future has been breaking up and down through this neckline (at around 101.00 to 101.13) all session and it is making players a bit nervous," he said. But he added that he was targeting 102.27 for the June futures within the next two weeks. Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer, speaking at a news conference following a regular policy-setting council meeting, said he did not expect any change in German interest rates in the foreseeable future. Tietmeyer added that although M3 money supply growth had been strong, this was no threat to German inflation.   "Tietmeyer's complacency in saying that M3 poses no inflationary danger reinforces the perception that the Bundesbank's rates will remain on hold until into 1998," said one analyst. He said this stance was further justified by the 'fits and starts' picture of the German economy offered in the Ifo survey. The March index of business sentiment fell to 92.4 from 93.6. Economists had been forecasting a rise to 94.00. Despite a generally upbeat mood for Bunds, the 10-year cash yield spread between German and U.S. debt slimmed to 116 basis points by late European trade from 120 at Wednesday's close.   But bond strategists said there was no reason to believe this underperformance would be anything other than short-lived. With economic activity muted, interest rates on hold, and inflation under wraps, German debt would prove more attractive than U.S. Treasuries in the medium term, they said. -- Frankfurt Newsroom + 49 69 7565 1246
MCAT	The Chinese yuan closed up at 8.2982 against the U.S. dollar on Friday from Thursday's 8.2991 with little impact seen from the news that four foreign banks had been granted the right to do yuan business, traders said. The authorities announced on Monday that four foreign banks with branches in Shanghai had been granted approval to do local currency business. Dealers said the news had no influence on today's movement of the yuan which stayed in a narrow range just above 8.3000 in dull trading.   The yuan opened slightly higher at 8.2989 and hit an intra-day low of 8.2990 early in the session. It then rose slightly to move around 8.2985 before a high of 8.2980 just before the close. Trading was dull, with most done at about 8.2985, traders said. "Most people stood on the sidelines in the last session of 1996," a dealer said. "The news on the foreign banks had no direct impact." "Foreign banks beginning to do yuan business will make the foreign exchange market more active next year," a second dealer said.   Dealers expect the yuan to move around 8.2980 when trading resumes after the New Year Day holiday. The yuan closed slightly down at 7.2000 from 7.1600 in extremely dull trading against 100 Japanese yen and up at 1.0723 from 1.0726 against the Hong Kong dollar. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004

GCAT	The European Union is considering breaking off high-level meetings with Iran and excluding top Iranian officials from its borders, according to a proposal to be discussed by EU foreign ministers next week. The proposal, drafted by senior political officials from EU capitals, accuses Iran of conducting state terrorism and reaffirms the suspension of the EU's "critical dialogue" policy with Tehran. "Progress can only be made if the Iranian authorities respect the norms of international law (and) refrain from acts of terrorism," a draft statement says. The 15-nation bloc on April 10 recalled its ambassadors and suspended its policy of trying to bring Iran closer to the West through talks after a German court found that the Iranian government was involved in the murder of Kurdish dissidents. In practice, this meant cancellation of one relatively low-level meeting of officials in May. But the move represented a significant shift towards the United States' view that Iran should be treated as a pariah state. U.S. officials have been touring EU capitals to discuss Iran ahead of the foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg next Tuesday and Wednesday. Under the proposal to be put to the ministers, the EU would suspend all bilateral visits by ministers to Iran or by Iranian officials in the 15 EU countries. EU governments would also work together to ensure that visas were not granted to "certain senior members of the Iranian hierarchy" and that Iranian intelligence personnel were excluded from EU member states, implying possible expulsion. Diplomats said it was not clear how many of the new measures would be agreed by the EU ministers, although there was no question of lifting the suspension of the critical dialogue. "There are a number of states...that do not want to upset Iran," one diplomat said. He said there was concern in some EU capitals that turning up the heat on Iran while it was preparing for elections could play into the hands of Tehran hardliners. The ministers are expected to send their countries' ambassadors back to Iran. The advocacy group Human Rights Watch said on Friday it had written to the EU ministers urging them to tell Iran that the resumption of normal relations was dependent on Tehran taking steps against agents murdering political dissidents. Iranian opponents of Tehran's Moslem rulers have urged the EU to break off its remaining links with Iran and impose sanctions. They plan a large demonstration in Luxembourg on Tuesday. In Paris, a French appeals court on Friday upheld prison sentences passed last year on two men for supplying Iran's secret services with information aimed at helping to kill opponents in France. Mojtaba Mashhady, 39, a French citizen of Iranian origin, was jailed for seven years. Iranian Hossein Yasdenseta, 37, was given three years.

GCAT	Rashaan Salaam rushed for a second-quarter touchdown, Jeff Jaeger kicked two field goals and the Chicago Bears' special teams made several big plays in a 15-13 victory over the Minnesota Vikings on Monday. The Bears (3-5) trailed 3-2 after the first quarter, but scored 13 consecutive points in the second period. Salaam's one-yard scoring run, which capped a seven-play, 58-yard drive, was sandwiched between field goals of 41 and 44 yards by Jaeger that made it 15-3 at the half. Jaeger's second field goal was set up by Mark Carrier interception of a Warren Moon pass. The Bears picked up their first two points on a safety when Kevin Minniefield blocked a punt and punter Mitch Berger knocked the ball went out of the end zone. Chicago's special teams came up big again in the fourth quarter when Sean Harris blocked a field goal attempt that would have put the Vikings ahead by one. Minnesota scored the only points of the second half in the third quarter as Moon found Qadry Ismail on a 54-yard touchdown strike to make it 15-10. The Vikings added a 43-yard Scott Sisson field goal to close the gap to 15-13. Dave Krieg completed 23-of-35 passes for 187 yards with two interceptions for Chicago. Moon was 15-of-26 for 218 yards with a touchdown and interception before suffering a mild right ankle sprain in the third quarter. Chicago linebacker Brian Cox made a huge play in the closing minutes when he stripped backup quarterback Brad Johnson at the 31 and recovered the fumble himself to seal the win for the Bears. The Vikings fell to 5-3, dropping two games back of first-place Green Bay in the NFC Central Division by losing for the third time in four games.

GCAT	A Moslem guerrilla faction claimed responsibility for the killing of Algerian union leader Abdelhak Benhamouda, whose death was mourned on Saturday by Algerians who staged a one-day work stoppage in his memory. The Algerian Jihad Islamic Front (FIDA), which is widely believed to be a small Moslem guerrilla group operating mainly in Algiers, said it carried out Tuesday's shooting. "The FIDA announces its responsibility in the attack which targeted Abdelhak Benhamouda, a man who placed himself in the service of the military junta," said a FIDA statement carried by leading Algerian newspapers on Saturday. In the statement, signed by the group's military commander in Algiers, Ahmed Abu Elfida, the group vowed to stage more attacks against the government and its supporters. A better-known Algerian guerrilla group, Armed Islamic Group (GIA), has also warned it will kill more Algerian personalities, residents said, quoting GIA warnings pasted on walls recently in the Algerian capital. Local authorities, aiming at thwarting Moslem rebel car bomb attacks in Algiers, on Saturday announced that vehicles were no longer allowed to stop in the streets of Algiers during the day, Algerian radio said. Offenders of the stop ban, from 7.a.m (0600 GMT) until 7.p.m (1800 GMT), risk losing their driving licences or the police impounding their vehicles. The radio said the ban would go into effect next Wednesday. More than 55 people died in eight bombings in Algiers and surrounding towns in January, according to official statements which blamed Moslem rebels for the explosions. Employees in Algeria, except for those in emergency services like hospitals, stayed away from work on Saturday to mourn Benhamouda, Union Generale des Travailleurs Algeriens (UGTA) officials said. Benhamouda was secretary-general of the UGTA, Algeria's one-million-strong workers' union umbrella. Schoolchildren were sent home on Saturday morning and main offices and shops were closed in Algiers, said residents speaking by telephone. President Liamine Zeroual, in a move dismissing guerrilla threats, on Saturday invited legal opposition parties for talks on parliamentary elections planned for the first half of this year, his office said in a statement. The talks would be held on February 11 to discuss the formation of an independent committee to oversee the polls, said the statement carried by the official Algerian news agency APS. Algeria has been without an elected parliament since 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had taken a huge lead. The Algerian government bars the now outlawed FIS from fielding candidates to run in the next parliamentary polls. According to official figures, nearly 200 people have been killed in Algeria in massacres and bomb attacks since the Moslem fasting month Ramadan started on January 10. Algerian newspapers put the figure at more than 250. About 60,000 people have been killed since the authorities in January 1992 cancelled the general election.
ECAT	Dade Coutny, Fla., could see an $80 million cash reserve carryover suplus for fiscal year 1996, which ended Sept 30, county officials said Tuesday. A combination of increased property tax revenues and increased property tax values as well a reduced spending in some areas contributed to the projected surplus, said Alex Penelas, Metroplitan Dade County executive mayor, in an interview with Reuters here. The final tally will be known when the county makes its mid-year budget adjustment for fiscal 1997 in the next few weeks, Penelas said.   Penelas, elected to the newly created position Oct 1,  is in New York City to meet with the media, tourism groups, bond raters and investors to discuss Dade County's new government structure as well as Miami's fiscal problems. The county has sold almost $600 million in debt in recent months, including a $437 million water and sewer bond issue. The county debt is rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc and A-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp. Penelas noted that while Miami is an integral part of Dade County, its fiscal problems have not adversely affected the county's overall financial stability. The biggest challenge facing Dade County is the welfare program and how to deal with about 40,000 people coming off the welfare rolls as federal reforms begin to take effect, Penelas said. --U.S. Municipal Desk, 212-859-1650

MCAT	Mexican overnight Cetes rates ended up 60 basis points at 18 percent on Friday from an low unrepresentative previous close, traders said, adding that the rate had nonetheless closed below session highs on a strong peso and low U.S. long bond yields. "The market was very firm due to exchange rate stability," a trader said. The benchmark 48-hour peso ended 4.2 centavos stronger at 7.9070/7.9100 per dollar. The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond was up 15/32 to yield 6.88 percent.   Traders noted there was little volume during the session as many in Mexico were on vacation. Mexican financial markets closed on Thursday, May 1, for Labor Day and will close again to observe the anniversary of the battle of Puebla on Monday, May 5. "There was some dealing in the money market, but rates did not change for much of the day," another trader said. Dealers said rates also fell from initial levels on demand for paper ahead of forecast cuts in primary interest rates.   Money market analysts forecast rates on bellwether 29-day Cetes could fall by up to 75 basis points from a current 19.40 percent at next Tuesday's central bank auction of government securities. The central bank drained 1.055 billion pesos from the system through a combination of three direct Cetes sales and two repos. One of the repos was assigned at four days at a rate of 18.00 percent.

MCAT	KCBT hard red winter wheat futures settled mostly higher on bullish export data and persistent concerns about dry weather in western Kansas, traders said. Dry wheat growing areas in western Kansas may receive scattered showers late this weekend or next week, but the long-term outlook for that area remains dry, meteorologists said. "The market is at the point where it knows it's either 20 cents too high or 10 cents too cheap, and it will know which way to go after this weekend's weather," a KCBT trader said. Traders said volumes were light late in the session as the market awaited private forecasts for weekend weather. Traders cited USDA's weekly export sales report as another source of support. USDA said net combined old and new crop export sales during the week ended May 8 totaled 705,500 tonnes, exceeding expectations of 350,000 to 500,000 tonnes. Firm cash basis markets underpinned the nearby May contract, adding strength to the May/July spread. KCBT wheat settled 1/2 cent per bushel lower to 13 cents higher, with May up 13 cents at $4.68. July was up 2-3/4 cents at $4.19. ((--Greg Frost, 816 561-8671))

GCAT	Burma's military government said on Sunday it had tightened security at mosques around Rangoon as religious unrest spread to the capital for the first time since similar trouble broke out last weekend in Mandalay. More armed troops and police were posted around the city after a group of about 50 Buddhist monks vandalised a mosque at Kanbe in the northeastern quarter of Rangoon on Saturday. The monks attacked the mosque, which was under renovation, with sticks and stones, then fled before police arrived. Mandalay is still under an 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew imposed last weekend when monks went on a rampage in the city, attacking several mosques and launching street protests after reports that a Buddhist girl had been raped by a Moslem man. Analysts said they were concerned at the spread of the violence to Rangoon and noted that it was sparked to some extent by the growing number of mosques in the capital. If attacks on Moslem places of worship were not controlled quickly they could start major religious strife, they said. "We understand very well what is happening at the moment and this is not a proper way of solving any problem," said a retired Buddhist officer. "We are all desirous of peace regardless of our religions. Without peace we are all in for trouble," he added. A leader of the Burmese Moslem community told Reuters that urgent consultations were being held with the minister for religious affairs, Lieutenant Myo Nyunt, and with comunity leaders to restore calm after the mosque attack. "We have met with the minister for religious affairs and we are holdings meetings to discuss the situation," said Hadji U Thein, chairman of the Islamic Religious Affairs Council, the most influential Moslem organisation in the country. He declined to comment further and there was no statement on the latest incident from Buddhist religious authorities. A spokesman for the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) said: "Appropriate security measures to prevent similar incidents from taking place have been taken around mosques in townships. The situation in Rangoon is calm and we will protect the Moslem community." He blamed elements out to disrupt Burma's pending entry into the seven-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) later this year and those seeking to destabilise Burma. "We suspect they will now try to cause trouble between the Buddhists and Hindus next. We have contacts with ASEAN and other Moslem countries, and they have been told of the situation here," the spokesman added. Burma is about 90 percent Buddhist and about four percent of the population is Moslem. Monks play a key role in this deeply Buddhist country and have in the past lent their support to political and social causes. The All-Burma Moslem Union, a group associated with Burmese exile groups based at the Burma-Thai border, accused the SLORC of being behind the latest Buddhist-Moslem strife and said it had systematically caused trouble for the Moslem community. "The SLORC has always discriminated against the Moslems. They call them 'Kala', or aliens with no nationality," ABMU president Ra Sak said by telephone. Last December, SLORC troops tore down a mosque in Nabu village in southwest Burma, and in January, a mosque in western Jaidong town was blown up, he said. He noted that police arrived only after the Kanbe mosque had been vandalised by the monks on Saturday. "If the SLORC continues to use Buddhist monks as their proxy to oppress Moslems, an all-out religious war could break out," he said.
MCAT	The Canadian Wheat Board said Thursday it had raised by C$15.00 to C$16.00 per tonne its 1997/98 Pool Return Outlook (PRO) for wheat and also hiked PROs for durum, feed barley and designated barley. CWB said in its April report that a severe frost in U.S. hard red winter wheat growing areas, flooding in the Red River Valley, and dry conditions in Australia and the European Union had contributed to the raising of the wheat projection. The durum PRO was increased by C$16.00 per tonne, boosted by poor crop conditions in North Africa, an expected cut in U.S. acreage and dry weather in Spain and Italy Feed barley PROs were raised by C$12.00 per tonne with production seen hurt by dry conditions in the European Union, the world's largest exporter of feed barley. Designated barley PROs were up C$7.00 per tonne on dry weather in the European Union and expectations that flooding in the Red River Valley in a significant portion of the North American six-row growing area. PROs are monthly CWB estimates of crop year returns, which take into account factors such as market fundamentals, weather and exchange rates.
GCAT	Brazilian mayoral elections strengthened an opponent of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's bid for re-election in 1998, but did not seriously hurt the president, analysts said on Saturday. Cardoso was barely affected by Friday's municipal second-round nationwide vote, although candidates of his PSDB party in the major cities of Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte took drubbings, analysts said. "As in the first round on Oct. 3, these elections had a local, not a national character," said Bolivar Lamounier of the Sao Paulo Institute of Economic, Social and Political Studies. But the election of Celso Pitta as mayor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, is seen as boosting his mentor, incumbent mayor and presidential hopeful Paulo Maluf, in his bid to block Cardoso's re-election efforts in Congress. Pitta, of Maluf's right-wing PPB party, easily defeated former mayor Luiza Erundina by 57.4 percent of the vote to 34.7 percent, according to official results. As a result, "Maluf's presidential aspirations and his opposition to Cardoso's re-election will gain force," Lamounier said. Pitta, a political neophyte personally picked and groomed by Maluf to be his successor, ran a campaign promising simply to continue the incumbent's work. His easy victory gave Maluf added clout to oppose Cardoso's re-election bill and ensured him a solid base for a national campaign, analysts said. The president's efforts to amend the constitution to allow him to become Brazil's first re-elected president will take center stage next week now mayoral campaigns are over. "The only major obstacle is Maluf," one analyst said, but added the government had already gained ground on the issue by installing a special commission in Congress' lower house and had so far avoided serious challenges while winning support. Therefore, analysts said, the impact of the mayor's race was seen as limited. "I'm not saying re-election will be easy, but these (runoff) elections are not going to weigh much," Lamounier said. The president wisely stood back from runoff campaigning, including Sao Paulo where Pitta's easy victory was expected, and campaigns centered on local issues of transport, health care and crime, he added. Cardoso "is in a comfortable position because he did in the second round what he should have done in the first," wrote columnist Dora Kramer in Jornal do Brasil. "He stayed far away from the campaign and thus avoided unnecessary wastage."

MCAT	Indian call money ended Friday unchanged in the 0.10-0.25 percent range with no trades reported, dealers said. Banks do not normally borrow on reporting days as this increases their reserve requirements for the next fortnight. Dealers said three-day money was quoted in the 1.25-1.50 percent range towards close of trade. Rates opened the day in the 2.0-2.25 percent range but came down on lack of demand and good supply, they said. Dealers said prices of government securities continued to firm up in active trade. "Demand for securities remains good as call money is low," said a dealer at a state-run bank. "This has been pushing prices by a few basis points every day for the past couple of weeks." Dealers said buying interest which had been largely concentrated in short-dated securities in the past few days spread to medium-term stocks also on Friday. They said the Reserve Bank of India put some medium-term securities on its sale list on Friday and this affected the market sentiment. Traded volumes on the National Stock Exchange were around 5.40 billion rupees against Thursday's 6.05 billion, a trader at a securities firm said. The 13.50 percent 1998 government of India stock firmed up to 103.30 rupees from its last traded price of 103.20 while the 13.70 percent 1999 rose to 102.70 from 102.57, dealers said.

GCAT	Chris Johnson parred the second playoff hole with Leta Lindley to win the the $1.2 million LPGA Championship on Sunday. Johnson bogeyed the 18th hole twice in less than a half-hour, once in regulation to force the playoff and once to keep the playoff going. But Lindley struggled on the second sudden-death hole, the par-4 10th, after sending her tee shot into the trees to the right of the fairway on the par-71 course over 6,386 yards. Lindley, seeking her first career win, missed a 30-foot par putt before the 39-year-old Johnson rolled in a six-footer for her eighth career victory and first since 1995. Two-time U.S. Women's Open champion Annika Sorenstam of Sweden fired a 4-under 67 and grabbed sole possession of third place at 2-under 282. She had a chance to force a three-way playoff, but missed a two-foot par putt on the 18th hole after making a charge on the back nine. Defending champion Laura Davies of Britain failed in a bid for her third victory at this event, although a final-round 68 moved her into a tie for fourth at even-par 284. Sherri Steinhauer, who led after the second round, had a 1-over 72 to join Davies three shots off the lead. The $180,000 first prize moved Johnson into the top five on the 1997 money list with earnings of $335,029. "It wasn't very pretty," Johnson said. "But my putting really helped me, held me together. My problem was with myself (not Lindley)." Lindley and Johnson shared the lead at the start of the day, and both shot even-par 71s for four-round totals of 3-under 281. They were two of only three players to break par for the tournament, the second major championship of the year on the LPGA Tour. The former University of Arizona stars went to just the fourth playoff in the tournament's 42-year history, but bogeyed the first sudden-death hole, the par-4 18th. Johnson chipped within six feet, but had her six-foot-par putt lip out. Lindley chipped four feet past the hole and missed the comebacker for par. Johnson said her career turned around five years ago after working with a golf pro who modified her swing. "There really wasn't a time when I was going to scrap (my career)," she said. "I could stay out here and have a good tournament now and then, wait for that time when it's your week and everything goes your way and God comes down and just says, OK, you're going to win this week.' "I said no, that's not what I want to do. If I'm going to be away from my husband, and if I'm going to travel and if I'm going to come out here, it's not worth it to struggle." Johnson, who earned the biggest paycheck of her 17-year career, grabbed a two-shot lead with a birdie on the par-5 11th hole while Lindley bogeyed. Both players bogeyed the par-3 13th hole, but Lindley recovered with a five-foot birdie at 14 and Johnson bogeyed 18 to set up the playoff. "I handled myself well," said Lindley, whose $111,711 check as runner-up exceeded by $99 her best yearly earnings. "I made a birdie before I made a bogey.  I hit the ball great," she said. "I hit some good putts that hit the hole and didn't fall for me. I did everything that I could and I put myself in an opportunity to win a major championship."

MCAT	South African industrials and all-shares on Monday thwarted market expectations of a retracement in late afternoon trade and climbed to close strong on mostly futures-driven trade, dealers said. Industrials generally shrugged off Wall Street's weaker close last Friday and, while the U.S. market would naturally have some effect on the local market, it was far outweighed by other factors, dealers said. Dealers said morning weakness was probably a follow-through from a bit of profit-taking at month-end last week. Trade this week was seen as being a tussle between the bulls and the bears and in many cases could finish only slightly firmer or weaker with a lack of economic indicators this week -- until Friday -- offering little other direction. Dealers said overall trade on Monday had been sluggish with most volumes traded in the all-shares. Gold shares dipped to the finish despite the bullion price looking healthy around the $362 an ounce level. The industrial index added 16.7 points to 8,261.0 points, all-shares rose 8.6 to 7,153.8 and golds were off 2.9 points to 1,562.9 points.
ECAT	Poland's gross domestic product (GDP) will meet the government's 1996 GDP growth target of five to six percent if strong industrial output growth continues, deputy head of the Central Statistic Office said. Roman Sawinski told a news conference that GDP growth should remain high in the fourth quarter due to a strong rise in industrial output, expected to stay around the 7.3-percent year-on-year level from third-quarter 1996. "At such high levels of output, one should expect growth in fourth quarter to reach about seven to eight percent and to meet the target envisaged in the 1996 budget," Sawinski said. Sawinski said GDP bottomed out at year-on-year 3.5-percent growth in the first three months of 1996 before picking up to 5.2 percent in the second quarter. That compares with robust 1995 growth of seven percent. He said 1996 growth was mostly fuelled by a jump in domestic demand, spurred by investment and fast growth of real wages. "The fast pace of industrial output should solidify the high growth rate for Poland's GDP," Sawinski said. In October, Poland's industrial output rose 13.9 percent year-on-year, and average wages in the enterprise sector rose nearly seven percent in real terms. Retirement pensions rose 2.3 percent in real terms in ten months of 1996 following the last one-off increase in September. In the first nine months of the year, total investment spending in Poland reached 24 billion zlotys and was 26.5-percent higher than in the same period of 1995. -- Krzysztof Wojcik +48 22 653 9700
ECAT	Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita said on Wednesday that the central bank's monetary policy is geared to ensuring economic recovery.   He told a news conference that Japan's economy is recovering gradually, with private consumption resuming a gradual recovery after being somewhat sluggish in the summer. "The BOJ's monetary policy is geared to ensuring a firm basis for economic recovery," he said. Matsushita said he expects the government to quickly carry out the "Big Bang" financial reforms unveiled last week. The reforms, put forward by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, are reasonable principles on which to rebuild Japan's markets and financial system to a level where they would be as effective as those in New York and London.   Matsushita said reform of Japan's postal savings system was not contained in the proposals, but a debate on this issue from a broad perspective would be useful. Reform of postal savings, as a public financial system, should be considered in a way in which it would support private-sector finances, and managed so that any changes would not cause confusion in the activities of private financial institutions, he said. Asked if the BOJ intended to continue outright purchases of government bonds, he said the BOJ would continue to watch if such purchases were needed in light of the money supply.   Matsushita said Japan's economic recovery seemed to be becoming solid. "Japan's economy is continuing its gradual recovery, but at the moment, the economic recovery appears to be becoming solid," he said. "We can well expect the economy's cyclical mechanism centring on private-sector demand to strengthen further as the economy moves towards a self-sustainable recovery track. However, we must still make sure this is on the way," he said. He said Japan's industrial output is on an upward trend after moving sideways in the first half of this year. Inventory adjustments in some materials industries are making steady progress, he said. On the demand side, steadiness in machinery orders showed good corporate capital investment. A decline in net exports, which was hindering the economy, had come to a halt, he said. Housing investment remained at a high level, he said. He added that private consumption had recovered and was showing a gradual growth this autumn, centring on durable goods, such as cars, after stalling in the summer due to changeable weather. Matsushita said the pace of improvement in employment levels and a rebound in corporate capital investment, including at small and medium-sized firms, needed to be watched.

Log-Tek said that payment for the Charter deal, which takes effect from July 1, will be based on a multiple of after-tax earnings of the Charter group for the financial year ended April 30, 1997 plus loan accounts due by the firm to Log-Tek. A further announcement will be made as soon as the year-end results of Charter, whose key business is the Academy of Learning, have been audited. Log-Tek said the rationale behind the Charter sale was a decision to dispose of its education business as it was not part of its focus to expand its logistics and information technology businesses. In view of both deals, Log-Tek urged shareholders to exercise caution in their sharedealings. -- Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003
ECAT	Direct foreign investment in Colombia, excluding the volatile oil sector, edged up a lackluster 1.0 percent between January and August over the same period in 1995, according to Coinvertir, the country's foreign investment board. In August, the last month for which official figures are available, new foreign investment flows excluding the oil industry totalled $86 million, 18 percent less than in the same month last year, Coinvertir said. It said the manufacturing and industrial sector had attracted most new foreign investment so far this year, accounting for 43 percent of the total. Central America and the Caribbean were the source of most new investment entering Colombia between January and August, with 45 percent of the total, acording to Coinvertir. It added that new foreign portfolio investment in the country totalled $177 million between January and August, a 16 percent decline from new portfolio investment in January-August 1995. -- Javier Mozzo, Bogota newsroom, 571 610 7944
CCAT	Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel said enough shareholders had attended an extraordinary general meeting on Thursday to hold a vote, expected after 1500 GMT, on a crucial 70 billion franc ($11.7 billion) debt restructuring plan. "The quorum of 25 percent has been reached," Eurotunnel executive chairman Patrick Ponsolle told the meeting. The company needs the approval of holders of two-thirds of the French shares and three-quarters of the British shares to pursue the deal struck in April to ease the crushing debt-servicing burden on the company. But the deal would also reduce shareholders' equity to 54.5 percent, giving Eurotunnel's creditor banks 45.5 percent. Before the meeting, Christian Cambier of the Eurotunnel Shareholders' Association said his group would vote in favour of the deal. It holds 2.5 percent of the shareholder votes. Another active shareholders' association, Adacte -- which holds some 12 million proxy votes out of the total 920 million -- opposes the debt restructuring, but the tide has recently turned in support of the deal. Last week the French and British governments said they would consider extending Eurotunnel's operating licence to 99 years from the current 65. They also said that if the debt deal was not approved, they would not be able to prevent the banks from taking over Eurotunnel's operating licence -- a declaration that swayed shareholder rights activist Sophie l'Helias. Others who have switched in favour of the deal include Bermuda-based Northern Cross Investments. Executive chairman Patrick Ponsolle has been mandated by 61,816 shareholders to vote on their behalf, the company said in a statement on Thursday but it did not indicate the size of their stakes. Ponsolle told the meeting the company was on track to improve its performance. He reiterated that it expected to show a loss of 2.72 billion francs this year, less than half the 1996 loss of 6.1 billion francs. The improvement hinges on the debt plan being approved which would lower interest charges to 3.2 billion francs for this year from 5.7 billion paid in 1996. He said he was "extremely confident" the group could reach the targets previously set to turn a profit in 2005 and pay a dividend the following year. Eurotunnel has been hobbled from the outset by a construction bill of 10 billion pounds, nearly twice the original cost estimate for the 51-km sub-sea link, and lower-than-targetted revenue. The agreement struck with the banks in April followed more than a year of negotiations. Shareholders were due to vote on the plan at a meeting on June 24 that was cancelled when not enough shareholders attended.
GCAT	O.J. Simpson could take the witness stand on Friday for a second time in his civil trial to tell what he was doing the night his ex-wife and her friend were murdered. But this time, the former football star will face gentler questioning from his own lawyers, compared to the harsh interrogation he received over three days last month at the hands of the plaintiffs' attorneys. Simpson is on the list of defence witnesses for Friday, but the jury was first expected to hear continued testimony from Robert Groden, an expert who alleges a photograph of Simpson apparently wearing the same kind of Italian designer shoes as the killer is a fake. Chemist Fredric Rieders, who specialises in identifying blood DNA, was expected to follow Groden to the stand, after which Simpson could testify as the last witness before the trial goes into recess for a two-week holiday break. But CNN's legal expert, Greta van Susteren, said she thought the plaintiffs would try to drag out the questioning of the prior witnesses in order to prevent Simpson from making a climactic appearance on the stand just before the holidays. "These lawyers are smart and the plaintiffs will want to question Groden and Rieders for as long as possible to preempt Simpson taking the stand on Friday," she said. Simpson was acquitted in October 1995 in criminal court in the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. He is now being sued in a wrongful death civil suit brought by the families of the victims. Simpson, who never testified in his criminal trial, took a verbal battering when called to the stand in November by the victims' lawyers. He sometimes gave statements that contradicted his own sworn deposition and flatly denied ever striking his ex-wife, even when confronted with graphic photographs of a bruised and battered Nicole Brown Simpson. His lawyers chose to delay their own cross-examination, and legal experts suggested this time they would concentrate on addressing specific contradictions, such as how he cut his hand the night of the murders. They will also want to clarify exactly where he was the night of June 12, 1994, when he has said variously he was sleeping, chipping golf balls, walking the dog or showering. "They must clear up the inconsistencies," TV legal analyst Starr Jones told Los Angeles TV station KTLA. Also, Simpson's attorneys will want him to talk about the positive aspects of his relationship with his ex-wife and their children in order to leave jurors with a good impression to carry with them over the Christmas and New Year's holidays, she said. "They must convince the jury that the O.J. they know and love is still there. They will want him to emphasise his relationship with Nicole had its ups and downs and that they both had (other) relationships ... but that he was not obsessive and there was no fuse burning."
ECAT	Smith Barney Inc said Tuesday it won $29.4 million Boulder, Colo., unlimited tax bonds at a true interest cost of 5.1488 percent.
CCAT	MCI Communications Corp Chief Executive Bert Roberts said Sunday that British Telecommunications Plc, through its $20 billion merger with MCI, would add to its per-share earnings after two years. "Combining the companies is accretive to earnings in the second year," Roberts told the merger news conference. "This is unprecedented in this type of merger." The new company, named Concert, will have 9.5 billion shares outstanding, of which 33 percent will be in the hands of MCI's shareholders, excluding British Telecommunications. BT currently holds a 20-percent stake in MCI. The executives explained that MCI's growth was strong enough to recoup the extra number of shares very rapidly. "MCI itself has a greater earnings growth than BT, and the combined group will have higher earnings growth because of synergies," said Sir Iain Vallance, BT's chairman. The companies said they expect to save $2.5 bln over the next five years through the elimination of duplication in networks and other activities.
CCAT	High oil product stocks in Singapore has forced at least one refiner to store cargoes outside its refinery complex due to poor regional demand, traders said on Thursday. Sources said Singapore Refining Co (SRC) had shipped product, including a 30,000-tonne cargo of gas oil, to Singapore Petroleum Co's (SPC) offshore terminal at Pulau Sebarok to prevent tank tops at the SRC refinery. Other products were shipped to SRC shareholder Caltex for storage.   "All the (excess) cargoes were lifted out today. There was some hiccup there earlier. We took one cargo to Pulau Sebarok for bunker use," a source at SPC said. The high level ofproducts is pressuring middle distillates particularly, traders said. Data from Singapore's Trade Development Board showed earlier on Thursday that middle distillate stocks have risen to their highest level in at least three and a half years. The data showed stocks in the week ending June 11 rose 993,000 barrels to 11.236 million barrels, the highest level since at least January 1994.   Traders said Singapore refiners would resist the temptation to cut runs to alleviate the high storage levels. In addition, margins improved over the past few days to produce a 50-cent per barrel profit on simple processing of Middle East crudes, traders said. A basic refinery margin on Dubai showed a profit of 67 cents Wednesday and a more complex cracking margin was $2.84 in profit. Negative margins in May prompted at least one refiner, Esso Singapore, to cut runs at its 230,000 bpd refinery by 10 percent.   Traders said the high middle distillate stocks in Singapore were due to the arrival of large arbitrage cargoes from the West amid poor regional demand. "The refiners are struggling to sell their products bacause of the large amount of arbitrage cargoes still around unsold," one trader said. SRC is jointly owned by SPC, British Petroleum Co Ltd Plc and Caltex, itself a joint venture between Texaco Inc and Chevron Corp. --Singapore Newsroom (+65-870 3093)

ECAT	Japan's long-term prime rate is likely to be raised to around 3.1 or 3.2 percent in May from 2.5 percent in April, bond traders said on Friday. The Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd's (IBJ) 1.60 percent five-year bank debenture issued in April was last traded at 2.3 percent on Friday, up sharply from Thursday's 2.03 percent, traders said. Judging from current market conditions, the coupon rates for the IBJ's May bank debentures and its May long-term prime rate are likely to be raised by 0.6 or 0.7 percentage point, bond traders said. An IBJ spokesman said the bank would announce its long-term prime lending rate for May next Monday. The prime rate, at which long-term credit banks lend to their most creditworthy customers, was cut by 0.2 percentage point to a record low 2.5 percent in December and has remained unchanged since then. The IBJ customarily sets its long-term prime rate 0.9 percentage point above its five-year bank debenture coupon rate. -- Tokyo Treasury Desk +81-3-5473-3748
GCAT	China is to restart horse races that were halted in 1987 because of poor equipment and shortages of capital, a sports official said on Thursday. The '96 China Cup Horse-Racing Open would be held next month in Guangzhou, capital of southern Guangdong province, Huang Wei, vice-secretary of the China Horsemanship Association, told Reuters by telephone. China halted sport horse-racing nine years ago because of poor conditions at race tracks, but races held for audiences willing to bet on the outcome were permitted to continue. Gambling is illegal in China, but race course owners say their activities are within the law because punters win a fixed percentage of the takings for each race. Conditions at the Guangzhou track had been much improved since 1987, Huang said, adding that betting would be forbidden at the races. "This is a sports activity... we do not have any activities involving gambling," he said, adding that the races would be financed by the Guangzhou track, a main venue for betting races. Other such tracks are in the capital Beijing and on an island off eastern Shandong province.
CCAT	Telecommunications carrier BellSouth Corp said it is interested in an alliance with Chilean cellular telephone operator Telecom which would extend the U.S. firm's mobile network throughout the country. "It's clear that we have to increase our commercial relationship with Telecom," said Mauricio Wior, BellSouth's vice president for Latin America. But talks with Telecom, controlled by local long-distance carrier Entel-Chile, were not a priority for the Atlanta-based firm, he said.   "We are interested in talking, but it is not a priority," said Wior. Entel took control this month of Telecom, which operates services in the north and south of the country, when it bought an 18 percent stake in the company from Motorola Inc. BellSouth, one of two major U.S. firms in the Chilean telecommunications market, has a concession covering Santiago and the central Fifth Region. Wior said BellSouth would delay deciding future moves until Chile's Supreme Court has ruled over an appeal by cellular companies over regulations governing personal telephone concessions which the government plans to award this year.

ECAT	Egypt and India pledged on Wednesday to forge closer trade and investment ties aimed at strengthening two of Asia's and Africa's largest emerging economies, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said. Moussa, who arrived in India at the weekend for a meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement, told a business conference that his nation and India were poised to seize the opportunities thrown up by six years of economic reforms in both countries. "The economic and trade relations that currently exist between us do neither reflect the reality of both countries emerging nor the historic and friendly ties that are binding us together," he said. Egypt, which in 1961 allied with India in launching the Non-Aligned Movement, is the south Asian country's largest African trading partner. Indian Foreign Ministry officials said President Hosni Mubarak was due to visit India later this year. Moussa met Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral earlier on Wednesday. The two ministers were due to sign treaties on investment protection and promotion, science and technology, civil aviation, tourism and media cooperation later on Wednesday. India and Egypt also agreed to set up a joint commission to facilitate investment and trade and exchanges in the fields of science, technology and culture. Moussa urged Indian businessmen to invest in his country, particularly in a new project establishing a new valley parallel to the Nile, built on two million acres of reclaimed land. "It will be up for investment in the areas of tourism, road building, airports, and construction," he said. "We certainly need more investment -- just as you here in India need more investment. We believe that both countries have a lot to achieve together either bilaterally as well as in the context of South-South cooperation," Moussa said.
ECAT	The World Bank has offered Thailand $1.5 billion in aid as part of an international funding package to prop up the country's flagging economy, the bank's local office said. "At the Tokyo meeting the World Bank pledged $1.5 billion of support focused on improving Thailand's competitiveness and prompting structural reforms in the economy," it said in a statement received here on Sunday. The bank will mount a mission in September to draw up a structural adjustment program for Thailand, it added. "Discussions held with Thai officials have resulted in the identification of areas of concentration, which includes the financial and banking sector, export promotion, labour productivity and social safety nets," it added. The contribution brings existing pledges from donors under an International Monetary Fund-sponsored rescue package to $16.7 billion. The money is needed to help support the Thai economy as it faces its severest crisis for decades. Slowing economic growth last year, a slump in exports, investment in unproductive sectors and recent currency instability have eroded investor confidence in an economy which had become heavily reliant on foreign investment.

In September, Economy Minister Jorge Camet announced the government would issue bonds on the local market in 1997 to raise 1.6 billion soles to pay off its debts with FONAVI and state pension bodies as well as "capitalizing the net worth of the Central Reserve Bank."

CCAT	Chemicals group DSM said on Wednesday operating profits at its industrial and fine chemicals business were depressed by maintenance shutdowns in caprolactam and melamine and a fall in fertilizers. Higher selling prices for caprolactam, melamine and acrylonitrile, due in part to the higher dollar exchange rate, boosted year-on-year sales figures, it said in a statement. But operating results for caprolactam and melamine were lower due to maintenance shutdowns and production outages. Fertilizers booked sharply lower operating results due to lower sales prices and an overhaul of one of the ammonia plants. Fine chemicals showed a "considerable increase" in both sales and operating profits, mainly due to acquisitions, higher selling prices and the strong dollar, DSM said. However operating results for base and fine chemicals as a whole were down sharply at 183 million guilders from a year-earlier 314 million. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
MCAT	CME live cattle futures closed sharply higher as the market resumed its recent uptrend after a short-lived downside correction, dealers said. Prices had been lower early but recovered to little changed levels with R.B. and H. Financial Services a noted buyer of August, and stops were triggered as the market moved into positive territory, floor sources said. "We hit stops and then we had a lot of technical type buying," one floor trader said. R.J. O'Brien was also a featured buyer of August and Iowa Grain of October. Cargill Investor Services sold October late, dealers said. They noted active trade in the cash market at $64.00 per cwt, steady with the bulk of trade last week. There was some concern earlier in the day that feedlots might be prepared to accept a lower $63.00 but it evaporated as the run-up in futures gathered momentum. August live cattle closed 0.925 cent up at 66.700 cents, just below the day's high of 66.825 cents. August set a contract high last week of 66.900 cents. Feeder cattle futures also closed up sharply, boosted partly by spillover buying from the live cattle pit.   Dealers said ADM Investor Services were among buyers of August feeders, Saul Stone was a noted seller and R.J. O'Brien was on both sides. August feeders closed 0.600 cent higher at 82.675 cents a lb after peaking at 83.200 cents. Last week the front month set a contract high of 83.400 cents. Other months ended up 0.600 to 0.125 cents. September buyers included ABN-AMRO Chicago Corp, LIT and Saul Stone with Lind Waldock and Cargill Investor Services among sellers. Dealers noted the latest CME feeder index, for July 22, was off $0.05 per cwt at $81.99. In feeder cattle options ADM Investor Services were a seller of September calls with a strike price of 82 cents. Boneless beef futures saw active interest in buying August and selling October. August closed up 0.80 cents at 98.00 cents a lb with October off 0.10 at 97.00 cents. August trimmings ended steady at 49.30 cents a lb. ((Nigel Hunt 312-408 8720))
GCAT	BOSTON, June 18 (Reuter - Hormorne treatments for post-menopausal women help them live longer and ward off osteoporosis but the benefits of oestrogen therapy wane after a decade, a New England Journal of Medicine study said. A team of Harvard University researchers also reported in the article to be published on Thursday that the benefits of such treatment may not be as dramatic for women not prone to heart disease. And, adding to the uncertainty, they found the therapy increases the risk of breast or endometrial cancer. The team led by Francine Grodstein tried to get a better assessment of the risks and benefits of hormone therapy using data from the Nurses' Health Study, a project begun in 1976 that tracks information on 121,700 female registered nurses. They found that those who took hormone treatments cut their risk of death by 37 percent compared to those who did not, but after 10 years the benefit was less pronounced. Hormone users were 20 percent less likely to die after a decade of hormone use. The risks also varied depending on a woman's health problems. Those who had several risk factors for heart disease because they suffered from high blood pressure, were obese or smoked saw a 49 percent drop in their death rate if they took hormones, while women who were at low risk for heart disease had only a 13 percent decline in their likelihood of death. When they examined specific causes of death, the Grodstein team found that hormones protected the heart even if the medicine was taken for longer than 10 years. However, after 10 years the death rate for breast cancer was 43 percent higher than it should have been. "Thus, with additional years of use, expected mortality advantages were, in part, offset by the risk of breast cancer," they said. "On average, the survival benefits (of hormone therapy after menopause) appear to outweigh the risk, but the risks and benefits vary depending on existing risk factors and the duration of hormone use and must be carefully considered by each woman." In an editorial in the Journal, Louise Brinton and Catherine Schairer of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the breast cancer threat may not be as great as some women might imagine. "Given that a white woman's cumulative absolute risk of death from the ages of 50 to 94 years has been estimated to be 31 percent from coronary heart disease, 2.8 percent from breast cancer, and 2.8 percent from hip fracture, the benefits of oestrogen use appear to far outweigh the risks," they said. But for women with a low risk of heart disease, they said, "the benefits of hormone therapy may not outweigh the risks." A study on Wednesday in the journal Neurology found that oestrogen treatment may ward off Alzheimer's disease. The study by Johns Hopkins University researchers found women who took oestrogen had a 54 percent lower chance of contracting the disease that attacks the central nervous system and can cause premature mental deterioration. Oestrogen may help prevent Alzheimer's by stimulating the growth of nerve cells, neutralising anti-oxidants that can damage chromosomes or increasing neurotransmitter levels, it said.
CCAT	Pride Petroleum Services Inc said Wednesday it has concluded the purchase of 13 mat-supported jackup rigs from Noble Drilling Corp for $269 million in cash. The company said the purchase was financed through the sale of senior notes and common stock. The company said it issued $325 million of 9-3/8 percent senior notes due May 1, 2007. The company said it also sold 4.3 million shares of common stock to the public at $17 per share. The company said proceeds of the combined offerings totaled about $387 million.

ECAT	Russia will return to the Eurobond market next week with a jumbo issue for as much as two billion marks ($1.2 billion), a senior Deutsche Bank AG official said on Friday. Georg Krupp, the Deutsche board member responsible for Russia, told a news conference that paperwork on rescheduling $32 billion of former Soviet debt to Western banks was taking longer than expected but would be over in a few months. And in a further sign of Russia's growing creditworthiness, he said Germany's biggest bank had agreed to lend Russia's Gazprom  gas monopoly 1.5 billion marks to finance a new pipeline to Western Europe. Krupp said he had discussed the Eurobond with Finance Minister Alexander Livshits on Thursday. "He again confirmed, and we agreed, that Deutsche Bank has received the mandate to issue the first mark Eurobond for the Russian Federation with a volume of 1.5 to 2.0 billion marks," Krupp said. "We assume that we can go to market with the bond at the end of next week," he added, noting that Russia would hold investor presentations on the bond in Frankfurt and Zurich next week. Deutsche's investment banking subsidiary, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, is leading the Eurobond with CS First Boston. Russia's debut $1 billion Eurobond last November marked its first return as a sovereign borrower to international capital markets since the Bolshevik revolution. The issue was heavily oversubscribed. It was the biggest ever debut sovereign Eurobond and strong demand from Western investors enabled Russia to raise two or three times more than originally planned. Demand is welling up for the mark offering, too -- Russian officials had been earlier talking of one or 1.5 billion marks. "The way market conditions are now, we can issue a bond of up to two billion marks," Krupp said. He refused to disclose the terms of the bond, which will be hammered out over after the Frankfurt-Zurich roadshow. But he hinted they could be finer than the terms on last November's 9.25 percent dollar issue, which was priced to yield 345 basis points over U.S. Treasury bonds. "It seems Russia has been rated pretty decently by the market since the dollar bond was placed and the rescheduling practically completed," he said. A 1.5 billion mark Eurobond this week from Argentina, which has similar or slightly worse ratings than Russia, was priced aggressively to yield only 195 basis points over German bunds. Krupp said the rescheduling of Soviet commercial bank debt assumed by Russia was almost complete. Under the deal agreed last November, the banks have rescheduled repayment of $24 billion of principal over up to 25 years and $8 billion of interest arrears over 20 years, with seven years' grace in both cases. But closing the deal is being delayed by detailed work of reconciling 30,000 individual loans, most of which have been traded in the secondary market, with their rightful creditors. "The process is running now at high speed. It will take a little more time. We hope that it can be completed in the next two to three months," Krupp said. Delays by the International Monetary Fund in paying out instalments of its $10 billion loan to Russia would not affect the final closure of the bank debt rescheduling, he said. Deutsche's confidence in the Russian market was underlined by an agreement to lend 1.5 billion marks for up to 10 years to Gazprom, which is building a new pipeline from the Yamal gas field to Western Europe, Krupp said. The credit is in addition to a $2.5 billion syndicated loan led by Dresdner Bank, signed in Frankfurt on Friday, to fund the same project. Krupp said the Deutsche loan would enable Gazprom to buy pipes from German engineering group Mannesmann AG. The bank was waiting for export cover from Germany's Hermes export credit insurance agency before signing the deal. ($ = 1.691 German Marks)
MCAT	U.S. T-bonds rose in London on Friday in thin holiday business with dealers saying the market was expected to be confined to range for the rest of the session. The benchmark 30-year bond was at 101-07 yielding 6.407 percent at 1054 GMT versus 101-02 at the Tokyo close. New York's closing price on Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday was 100-29. "The market has a positive bias, but should trade for the rest of the day in a pretty tight range," said one trader at a U.S. bank in London. The trader said there was not much interest in the market with so many people still on holiday, and data due on Friday afternoon was unlikely to make much impact. Trading will be abbreviated in New York this session, when the market will close at 1900 GMT. -- October personal income, which is forecast to be unchanged after a 0.6 percent rise in September, and personal spending for October, forecast up 0.3 percent after a 0.1 percent increase the previous month are due at 1330 GMT . -- International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 6176
ECAT	Total direct foreign investment in Romania since the 1989 end of communism rose to $2.2 billion at the end of 1996 from $1.6 billion the previous year, the Romanian Development Agency (ARD) said on Monday. It said the $608.4 million in foreign investment last year came from contributions of capital to newly created joint ventures, increases of capital of existing companies and investment in privatised companies. The largest single foreign investor in Romania is South Korea's Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd, which last year put $53 million into a Romanian Black Sea shipyard, raising its investment in the Balkan country to $200 million. The South Korean company had previously bought a 51 percent stake in a local car marker, which it plans to expand further before the year 2000 on $1.0 billion investment. Romania hopes foreign investment, now at a paltry level compared with other East European countries, to pick up this year as the new centrist government pledged to support foreign investors by boosting facilities, including tax cuts and foreign ownership of land. Local economists say in order to attract foreign investors cash-strapped Romania will have to speed up restructuring and privatisation, secure a smooth run of the foreign exchange and capital markets and work out of a separate law on portfolio investment. Local media recently said a group of around 20 U.S. and British companies were expected in Romania early in February to look into investment opportunities in chemistry, the heavy and machine-building industries and in the capital market. Envisaged investment by those companies was $10 billion. -- Luli Popescu, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264

GCAT	The Albanian ambassador to Rome told Reuters on Sunday that more than 80 people were believed to have died when a refugee boat sank on Friday night. Pandeli Pasko said he had compiled a list of missing people after talking to survivors in the southern Italian port of Brindisi on Saturday. According to his figures, between 120 and 130 people were on the boat and only 34 were rescued.   "I spoke to all but two of the survivors individually and they told me who was with them," Pasko said in a telephone interview. "We made up a list as best we could. "My God, what a tragedy." A list of names faxed to Reuters by the Albanian embassy referred to 79 missing people, many of them women and children and some identified merely as "a friend". But Pasko said it was not definitive and he had still to speak to two of the survivors rescued on Friday after the ancient harbour patrol craft collided with a navy ship trying to prevent it entering Italian waters in the Adriatic.

ECAT	Romania's parliament approved the 1997 state budget on Thursday, a key plank of the new centrist government's push to win fresh western credits ahead of an International Monetary Fund meeting next week. Parliament approved the law by 230 votes to 157 after a week of debate under emergency procedures. Leftists, thrown out of office in last November's election, and nationalists voted against. "Parliament has understood that delaying the budget creates problems for social projects and that we cannot leave the country without money," Finance Minister Mircea Ciumara said in the final stages of debate. The IMF is to decide on restoring credits for Romania at a Board meeting on April 23 and saw the budget and the progress of market reforms as a pre-condition for approval. The Fund is considering loans of about $400 million, which would pave the way for a further $600 million in credits from the World Bank. The government has made plain its reformist credentials by announcing plans to pass 40 pieces of legislation to speed privatisation and restructure oversize communist-era industry. A bank selloff bill is to clear parliament on Friday, while amendments to foreign investment, banking and land leasing bills are expected to get cabinet approval within days. Opposition leaders accused the new ruling coalition of failing to meet campaign promises to raise the living standards of Romanians, who earn an average of $80 per month, to those of neaqrby ex-communist Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. "The adoption of the budget represents the victory of the government against the country," Adrian Nastase, First Vice President of the Party of Social Democracy (PDSR), told the session of parliament's two chambers. Ciumara retorted that the PDSR had squandered decades worth of budget revenues while in power. It was incomprehensble, he said, to vote against the budget "and leave children without benefits and pensioners without pensions". Under the law, the state budget deficit was set at 12.6 trillion lei ($1.8 billion) or 5.4 percent of gross domestic product, which is expected to contract by three percent after growth of 4.1 percent in 1996. It also provided for the consolidated budget deficit to be trimmed to 4.5 percent of GDP from 5.8 percent last year. That figure was nearly three times over targets set with the IMF. Inflation is forecast at a year-on-year rate of 90 percent despite reaching 76.5 percent in the first quarter after unrealistic prices for staples and utilities were freed. The IMF has acknowledged that the inflation forecast is too ambitious and many economists say it will have to be revised along with the entire budget this summer. Latest government statistics put the state budget deficit at about 340 billion lei for the first two months of the year. Taking account of inflation, that figure reflected cautious expenditure compared to last year's figure of 311 billion. The IMF gave its backing to proposed indicators in talks with ministers launched immediately after last November's election victory by the centrists. The Fund suspended credits to Romania last year after criticising the leftist administration's spending record and restrictions on foreign exchange markets. ($=7,063 lei)
ECAT	A two percent cut in South Africa's prime rate was possible in 1997 owing to an expected improvement in the country's export performance, the University of Stellenbosch's Bureau for Economic Research said on Friday. In its last economic review for 1996, the BER said that the recent sharp depreciation of the rand should increase the competitiveness of South African exports. The overseas economic upswing was likely to strengthen further and this was seen am additional boost to exports over the next six to 12 months. "Imports, on the other hand, are likely to be constrained by weaker domestic demand and the rising costs of imports related to the depreciation of the rand," BER said. All this should result in a meaningful reduction in the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, which in turn should make for easier money market conditions, it said. As a result, the pressure on interest rates would be downward and BER believed that a two percent reduction in the prime rate next year was a distinct possibility. "This view could of course be negated should government decide to follow a 'big bang' approach to the removal of exchange control. "Under such a scenario, the prime rate could increase sharply, by perhaps three to five percent in the short term." However, the BER said the government was unlikely to adopt such an approach in view of its often publicly stated desire to adopt a gradual abolition approach. The BER said that it was a matter of concern that net capital inflows from abroad had failed to adequately materialise in order to finance the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. "In view of the precariously low level of South African gold and foreign reserves, the failure of imports to moderate significantly further and/or exports to accelerate in the next six months or so, will invariably necessitate a continued restrictive monetary policy stance in the short term." -- Cape Town newsroom +27 21 25-2238
ECAT	Improved tax collection has left the South African government on target to achieve its four percent budget deficit target in 1997/98 despite acute pressure on spending, economists say. Finance Minister Trevor Manuel is expected to deliver a constrained budget to pacify financial markets on March 12, they said. According to a Reuters poll of 10 economists, Manuel will announce real spending cuts, although not as deep as some reports have suggested. The consensus forecast was for expenditure in 1997/98 (April-March) of 189.9 billion rand, 7.8 percent up on this year's revised total of 176.1 billion. After allowing for inflation of nine percent, this represents a real cut of just over one percent. South African papers reported last year the cabinet had agreed a figure a spending figure of 186 billion, but analysts say such a low number looks unrealistic. Citadel Investment's Louis Fourie, explaining high expenditure, said: "We're still in the process of revamping South Africa and paying farewell packages to civil servants. We're not normal yet." On the revenue side, analysts expect 164.7 billion, up from 147.4 billion this year, thanks to good progress in improving tax collection. That would give a deficit of 25.2 billion, representing 4.05 percent of gross domestic product compared to the 5.1 percent budgeted for 1996/97. Privatisation receipts of two to three billion rand should help swell government coffers, but some economists said markets did not want to see this money used to cut the deficit. "You can't include it in the budget. That's bad. The markets won't like it," said BOE NatWest economist Nick Barnardt. Manuel has made deficit reduction a central plank of his economic strategy. The government's Growth, Employment and Redistribution plan, published last June, called for a budget deficit of four percent in 1997/98, falling to 3.5 percent in 1998/99 and 3.0 percent in 1999/2000. "The deficit and government dissaving are being brought down over a period of time. The budget will be roundly welcomed by guys like myself," said Rudolph Gouws of Rand Merchant Bank. "They are broadly on the right track, and I like this sort of medium-term orientation." Revenue figures for the first 10 months of the current financial year paint a generally encouraging picture. From April 1996 to January 1997, revenue collections of 122.1 billion rand were 14.6 percent up on last year. "It's a given...Better tax collection is going to add quite a squeeze to budget deficits," Nedcor's Dennis Dykes said. George Kershoff of Stellenbosch University's Bureau for Economic Research was upbeat: "I'm quite confident about the budget. The Minister of Finance has really put his credibility on the line to reduce the budget deficit." But Equisec's Dawie Roodt took a more conservative view, saying 1997/98 would be a watershed year for the government to show it could avoid a debt trap. "If they can reach four percent then that's bullish news but it will be very difficult...The government's honour is on the line and real political determination could be forthcoming." The government has budgeted 34.4 billion for servicing its debts in 1997/98, a figure which could rise to around 41 billion rand in 1997/98. But Manuel says the debt burden is being brought under control, announcing this week that the government debt to GDP ratio should fall from 58 percent to 55 percent this year, the first decline in this key ratio in over six years. No VAT or major tax hikes are anticipated, except for the usual "sin taxes" against cigarettes and alcohol. There may also be an increase in the fuel levy, analysts said. The budget balance aside, the markets will also be waiting keenly for news on further relaxation of exchange controls around budget time after Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said on Tuesday he wanted to see individuals given some scope to invest abroad. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003
MCAT	The Shanghai stock exchange is looking at a long hard road to catch its Hong Kong counterpart after China takes over the colony, but could match it in size and maturity within a decade, analysts said on Monday. Shanghai's bourse is young -- created only seven years ago -- and has a market capitalisation only one-fifth the size of Hong Kong's. But it is one of the fastest-growing exchanges in the world and turnover can match that of Hong Kong on given days. Beijing's securities authorities have reined in the speculative exuberance of China's markets in recent weeks, bringing prices down sharply. But analysts said that in the long run, the clampdown would help the markets to mature. "In 10 years, you could see the Shanghai stock market rivalling Hong Kong in size and in maturity," said Hoare Govett Asia's Bruce Richardson in Shanghai. "We have big scandals, stock price manipulation and a totally uneducated retail investor base, but my sense is that some investors are learning how to invest in an informed manner rather than playing the odds," he added. Chinese analysts and officials also see the development of Shanghai's stock market as a long-term task, but with the prospect of catching up with Hong Kong a real possibility. "For a period after Hong Kong's return to China, the Shanghai stock exchange will continue to attract domestic funds while Hong Kong focuses more on international liquidity," an exchange official said privately. "But the exchange is developing much more quickly than its Hong Kong counterpart and its competition with Hong Kong and other world-class bourses is not completely out of the question after the year 2000," he said. The total market capitalisation of the Shanghai bourse is now around 840 billion yuan ($101.2 billion), while that of the Hong Kong stock exchange is around HK$3.6 trillion ($461.5 billion). Daily turnover in Shanghai is now around nine billion yuan, compared with 9.1 billion yuan for the whole of 1991, the first year of the exchange's operations. Shanghai hosts 380 listed firms against more than 600 in Hong Kong, but is adding companies at a furious rate -- more than 50 so far this year. Hong Kong returns to China on July 1 after more than 150 years of British colonial rule. The bulk of the firms in Shanghai have domestic currency A share listings, which are off-limits to foreign investors, while only 44 have listed foreign currency B shares. "We anticipate the Shanghai market will expand rapidly in the next decade," said a China stock analyst with a major foreign brokerage in Hong Kong. "The central government is grooming Shanghai as a future international financial centre, and they want to speed up the pace of market capitalisation expansion," she added. The weak international element to the Shanghai market is currently its main problem, the analyst said. "The crucial factor determining the future prospects of the Shanghai exchange is the accessibility of foreign investors to the domestic stock market," she said. "For Shanghai to evolve into a genuine international stock exchange, foreign investors have to be in the market. The merger of the A and B shares should be realised within five years, which will make Shanghai much more attractive," the analyst added.
MCAT	Czech shares fell sharply at Thursday's fixing while the Czech crown was hit by its most turbulent morning yet on the foreign exchange markets. Apart from blue chip power utility CEZ, which fell 26 crowns to 869, most of the downward pressure came from issues in the broader market. Dealers say continued uncertainty in the foreign exchange markets over the fate of the beleagured Czech crown is the decisive issue determining movevments on the PX50.
GCAT	NATO ended an historic two-day summit on Wednesday with leaders vowing to close the Cold War divide between East and West as the alliance brings former Soviet bloc foes under its security umbrella. Setting NATO's course for the rest of the century and into the next, the 16 member-states invited in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, promised to admit others in the future and launched a new security council spanning three continents. U.S. President Bill Clinton hailed it as the dawning of a new Europe "undivided, free and at peace" and predicted the new defence arrangements would help sweep away the last remnants of what was once known as the Iron Curtain. But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov, head of Moscow's delegation to the summit, reasserted Russia's strong opposition to the alliance's eastward thrust, telling reporters: "The expansion of NATO presents more problems than answers." Within the alliance, the enlargement plan unleashed one of the most heated summit battles in decades. The United States ultimately prevailed with its demand that the first wave be limited to the three favourites, but France won a pledge to consider Romania and Slovenia in future rounds. The debate also exposed serious differences over the U.S. role as the world's sole remaining superpower and resentment about what is seen as growing American heavy-handedness. "The negotiations were difficult, sometimes sharp, but we were able to build a bridge," German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told reporters. "This is a huge success." The bickering that marked the summit's closed-door sessions came into public view at the leaders' final news conferences, with Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac at odds over the costs of the biggest expansion in NATO's 48-year history. Chirac said France would not pay an extra franc toward NATO's budget to finance the admission of new members. "We took a very simple position, that enlargement should be done at zero cost," he said, arguing that there was no longer a military threat in Europe and the alliance needed lighter structures and smaller forces. But at a separate news conference, Clinton said the United States and its allies would have to bear "modest costs" for building military infrastructure in the new member states. Cost estimates for NATO's eastward enlargement have varied wildly, with the Clinton administration putting the pricetag at $27-35 billion by 2009 while the U.S. Congress budget office put it as high as $100-200 billion. Kohl dismissed these estimates as exaggerated in the interests of the military-industrial complex. "It is completely absurd to link NATO enlargement with cost factors as if the aim was to rearm large areas of Europe to the teeth," he told a news conference. Chirac, who led a bloc urging wider enlargement, told reporters: "You can always say that it's not enough and not fast enough but you can't ignore that progress has been very rapid." But after the summit ended, Chirac told reporters he was certain NATO would invite Romania and Slovenia to join in 1999 when it marks its 50th anniversary. During the second day of the summit, NATO took another major step toward redrawing the European security map, inaugurating a new security council of nations spanning North America, Europe and former Soviet Asia. Leaders of the alliance and 28 partners formally launched the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, an organization intended to meet the security concerns of non-NATO members. NATO also signed a sweeping new security charter with Ukraine, sealing the Slav nation's shift away from the former Soviet sphere of influence and closer to the Western orbit. The new grouping includes countries seeking alliance membership like Romania and Slovenia, neutrals such as Switzerland and Austria, and former Soviet republics like Lithuania and Tajikistan. Russia is also a member, but in a clear sign of protest against NATO's enlargement, President Boris Yeltsin snubbed the alliance by sending only a low-level delegation. The council, which will have a secretariat at NATO's Brussels headquarters, gives a direct channel of communication to NATO in case of any external threat, a forum for political consultation and a basis for joint military exercises. Unspoken at the NATO summit is the fear that Russia may some day abandon the road to democratic reforms and again threaten its neighbours. At the summit on Wednesday, Serov repeated that Moscow was "categorically opposed" to the admission of the Baltic states into NATO and maintained that Russia was ready to provide "all the necessary security" for them. Russia insists that membership by any of the former Soviet republics would threaten its own security. Risking Moscow's wrath, the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have applied anyway. Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis predicted his country would join within seven years.
CCAT	The war of words between British Gas and the industry watchdog Ofgas turned sour again on Thursday as Ofgas director general Clare Spottiswoode dismissed the company's attitude as "not serious." Earlier the company rejected proposals by Ofgas for a new pricing regime at its pipeline and storage arm TransCo, triggering a lengthy Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. Spottiswoode told reporters "this has not been a process where we felt they were seriously in discussion."   She said British Gas had held only about four or five meetings with Ofgas officials over TransCo, and she had met the company only once on this issue since putting forward moderated price control proposals in August. "The situation has been one where they were not involved in negotiations in any real sense. The amount of contact since the final proposals has been very limited." The regulator added that she had made more concessions to British Gas in August "than I felt comfortable with" in order to "give them no excuse for taking it to the MMC."   British Gas accused Ofgas of pursuing "unjustified and unworkable proposals" that would slash 400 million pounds a year from its cashflow, put the safety of its system at risk and lead to further job losses. Spottiswoode wants a one-off cut of 20 percent in the tariffs that TransCo charges to gas suppliers, followed by four years of charges pegged at 6.5 percentage points below inflation. Ofgas believes this would cut about 30 pounds a year from an average household gas bills.   British Gas chairman Richard Giordano accused the regulator of a "flawed" approach, saying British Gas had been refused access to key reports on which Ofgas had based its price proposals. Spottiswoode defended herself against the complaint, saying it would have been unfair to give British Gas full access to information which was denied to their competitors. "There was nothing in it for us and everything in it for British Gas," Spottiswoode added.   British Gas shares fell 6p to 193-1/2p as investors bemoaned the fact that the second MMC enquiry in four years for the company will bring months of continued uncertainty. "British Gas has the hope it may salvage something, but there are absolutely no guarantees," said Irene Himona at broker SG Strauss Turnbull. "This (referral) means we will not find out the full story for the dividend for another nine months," she added. British Gas shareholders had already been let down on Monday by the company's failure to agree the sale of part of its loss-making gas supply business to Scottish Hydro-Electric.   British Gas is already under strain as it tries to re-negotiate so-called "Take-or-Pay" contracts, which oblige the utility to buy gas from North Sea producers at prices well above market rates. Many industry analysts would rather see British Gas swallow the Ofgas proposals and put more effort into unravelling its crippling Take-or-Pay contracts. British Gas, privatised 10 years ago and still struggling on many fronts to cope with the loss of its monopoly, plans to split itself in half next year into a domestic gas supply business known as British Gas Energy and TransCo.

MCAT	Global commodities prices will hold broadly steady in 1997 and rise by four percent in 1998, German economic research institute IFO said. IFO was releasing results agreed by a group of nine European research institutes (AIECE) which monitor price trends. The forecast for 26 non-energy commodities assumed economic growth of 2.6 percent in 1997 and 2.7 percent in 1998 in the industrialised world and the dollar at around 1.70 marks. Energy prices were forecast to drop by one percent 1997 and by five percent in 1998 after a 15 percent rise in 1996. The overall effect of the price changes on global economic growth should be neutral as falls in energy prices would be offset by price increases in other sectors, the report said. Cereals producers had expanded production after high prices in 1996 and this should reduce prices in 1997 and 1998. AIECE forecast wheat prices off 23 percent (1997) and seven percent (1998), barley off 17 and seven, and maize off 19 and five. Coffee prices, which shed 26 percent in 1996, were forecast to rise by 31 percent in 1997 and to be steady in 1998. Sugar, which was down five percent in 1996, was seen down six percent in 1997 and off two in 1998. Cocoa was projected five percent and one percent higher over the two year, after gains of two percent in 1996. Forecasts for base metals were as follows -- aluminium up 10 percent in each year (down 16 in 1996), nickel up three and 13 (off nine), copper up seven both years (off 22), lead off eight and up eight (up 23), tin off three then up four (off one), zinc up 22 and up six (off one). Rubber prices were forecast to fall by six percent in 1997, followed by a seven percent rise in 1998 (off five percent 1996). Cotton prices were seen broadly steady over the two-year period after a 16 percent decline in 1996. --Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275

GCAT	Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini has welcomed an initiative by France and Germany to reform the European Union, saying Europe was ready to look beyond purely economic questions to issues that directly affected its people. President Jacques Chirac of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany sent a letter on Monday to fellow EU leaders calling for closer cooperation on police, justice, foreign affairs and defence, and a shakeup of EU institutions. In a statement on Monday, Dini said the letter further convinced him that a consensus was emerging in the bloc to move forward on key institutional reforms, especially following a draft treaty unveiled by Ireland last week. "In the letter, I found echoes of positions we promoted at the (Turin) conference," said Dini, who as prime minister hosted the EU's inter-governmental conference in Turin last March when Italy held the bloc's revolving presidency. "Beyond the single solutions the letter presents, it seems to me that negotiations can now proceed along lines that will attract more and more consensus," he said. EU president Ireland on Thursday unveiled a working paper for an eventual treaty to be approved at an EU summit next June in Amsterdam. The draft is set to be discussed at an EU summit in Dublin on Friday. Dini said much progess could be made between now and the Amsterdam summit. "We can make clearer...aspects of Europe's construction which directly affect citizens, making them part of economic and monetary issues which currently dominate public attention," Dini said.
CCAT	Philippine Airlines Inc expects losses of "more or less" two billion pesos in the current fiscal year ending March 31, 1997, Jaime Bautista, the company's chief fianncial officer, said on Tuesday. The airline posted a loss of 2.18 billion pesos in the 1995/96 year.   The airline had earlier projected a lower loss for the current fiscal year at 1.0 billion to 1.3 billion pesos. "Because of the strike we did not meet out target," Bautista told reporters after a shareholders meeting. "The strikes cost us 500 million pesos." The airline had been besieged with a series of strikes prior to last year's November summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation due to wage issues. It later was able to forge three separate collective bargaining agreements with three labour unions. After three straight years of losses, Bautista said the airline is seen returning to profitability in 1998 as the stepped-up delivery of new aircraft improves operations. Philippine Airlines has embarked on a $4.0 billion re-fleeting and modernisation programme involving 36 new aircraft. --Manila newsroom (631) 841-8937

It said that the China Securities Regulatory Commission would order any unauthorised companies to halt such issues and return all funds raised along with interest.
ECAT	A senior Indian Finance Ministry official said on Thursday that measures which the government has announced over the past month constituted a "package" aimed at boosting economic growth. "There has been a series of announcements over the past 30 days," said the official, who asked not to be named. "That is what the package is." The official's comments appeared to confirm that the government was not preparing a single, new package of economic measures to boost the capital markets before Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda leaves for Switzerland on Friday. The government was preparing a list of measures which had already been unveiled as well as a statement outlining steps taken to boost the economy, the official said. Stock markets have been jittery on speculation that Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda may announce a fresh batch of reforms before he leaves for the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Friday. Blue chips suffered fresh losses on the Bombay stock exchange on Thursday. The benchmark index fell 15.92 points or 0.45 percent to 3,510.05. -- New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024

CCAT	Coles Myer Ltd said on Wednesday that it expected first half retail profits to be on target following a 5.4 percent rise in 1996/97 first half sales to A$9.945 billion.   Sales in the second quarter ended January 26 rose 5.2 percent to A$5.50 billion, with the company citing satisfactory trading before and after the key Christmas period. "We bought conservatively and there was less pre-Christmas discounting in the major businesses compared to last year," chief executive Dennis Eck said. "Overall, the business managing directors and support groups have delivered against their respective business plans as we continue to roll out the agenda we developed. We expect the half year retail profit to be in line with our plan," Eck said.
ECAT	Bulgarian consumer price inflation for 1997 is seen at 670-700 percent, up from earlier forecasts of 566 percent if monthly inflation topped three percent for each of the last five months, a National Statistics Institute (NSI) official said on Monday. "Cumulative inflation for this year is expected at between 670 and 700 percent if month-on-month price rises remain above three percent between August and December," NSI vice chairman Milcho Mladenov told Reuters. Inflation accelerated to 3.7 percent month-on-month in July from 0.8 percent in June, the NSI said earlier on Monday. Cumulative inflation from January through July stood at 505.6 percent. "Consumer price rises last month were only partly due to the mark's fall against the dollar. But we saw a much wider gap between producer prices of foods and their retail prices," said Mladenov. Milk prices rose 13.2 percent last month, cheese gained 14.1 percent, cooking oil 30.7 percent and fresh fruit 53.8 percent. Consumer price inflation for 1997 was assumed at 566 percent in this year's budget under a currency board system recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to curb inflation and stabilise the economy. Annual inflation for 1996 was 310.8 percent. Under the system, a form of a fixed exchange rate regime, the lev was pegged at 1,000 to the mark as an anchor currency from July 1. The mark fell to 1.839 per dollar on global markets on July 31 from 1.747 on July 1, dragging the lev down against the dollar on the domestic market. -- Anastas Petrov, Sofia Newsroom, (++359-2) 91188

"The company will have a lot of drilling in the third quarter and expenses were also higher in this quarter," said Eugene Nowak, analyst at ABN AMRO First Chicago Corp.

MCAT	Interbank rates fell across the board as fresh liquidity ahead of the weekend and hopes of a further funds inflow this week eased the pressure on the market, dealers said on Monday. One-week interbank rate fell to 6.90/7.10 percent against 7.8/8.0 on Friday, two-week to 7.00/30 percent against 7.50/70 and three-week to 7.10/25 percent from 7.40/50. One-month money eased to 7.20/30 percent from 7.40/45, three-month to 7.25/30 percent from 7.40/45 and six-month to 7.30/35 percent from 7.45/50, the dealers said. They said the overnight interbank rate's fall on Friday to 6.5 percent, from over 8.0 percent previously after the maturity of a 500 million ringgit Bank Negara bill, prompted the fall in other interbank rates. "There is a little confusion why the rates have fallen so much today," said a dealer with a Malaysian bank. He said the market has been tight for the last few weeks and the one maturity was unlikely to ease the situation. Most dealers said the most possible explanation was the market's anticipation of liquidity improving further this week by nearly one billion ringgit. On Wednesday, 420 million ringgit will mature from a long-term government bond and, on Friday, 500 million ringgit in Bank Negara bills. "The central bank has no plans to roll over the funds at the moment, which means the market's tightness will ease further," one dealer said. Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange rose across the board, reflecting the fall in spot rates, futures dealers said. At 0330 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) June contract was steady at 92.67, or an implied yield of 7.33 percent. But, September was up four points at 92.70, or 7.30 percent, and December up four at 92.66, or 7.34 percent. -- Madhav Reddy (603-230 7509) .
GCAT	A fire caused by a burning candle razed the oldest Protestant Christian church on Indonesia's holiday island of Bali on Christmas Day, the official Antara news agency reported on Thursday. No casualties were reported. Church authorities estimated the cost of the damage to the church, built at Buduk on the predominantly-Hindu island in 1931, at 500 million rupiah ($212,000).
ECAT	Debt growth in nonfinancial sectors of the U.S. economy slowed to a 4.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter from a revised 6.3 percent rise in the first quarter, the Federal Reserve said Thursday. Nonfinancial debt includes all the obligations of U.S. households, governments and businesses but excludes financial companies like banks, mortgage and finance companies. A major reason for slower second-quarter growth was that federal government debt advanced only at a 1.7 percent annual rate, down sharply from a 6.6 percent first-quarter rate of increase.   Previously, the Fed said total nonfinancial sector debt had grown at a 6.2 percent annual rate in the first three months of this year but it revised that estimate up slightly to 6.3 percent. During the second quarter, household debt growth eased to a 7.6 percent annual rate of increase from 8.7 percent in the first quarter. The Fed said borrowing in home mortgage and consumer credit markets was lower in the second quarter. Business debt growth fell to 4.7 percent a year in the second quarter from five percent in the first quarter.   "Issuance of coporate bonds strengthened but businesses reduced their borrowing from other sources, including banks and the commercial paper market," the Fed said. The one sector where debt grew quickly in the second quarter was state and local governments, whose debts climbed at a 3.5 percent annual rate after shrinking in the first quarter at a 1.2 percent rate. The Fed said state and local governments were issuing tax-exempt securities faster than they paid them off. At the end of the second quarter, the level of domestic nonfinancial debt was $14.3 trillion. The federal government's share of the total was $3.7 trillion while nonfederal sectors owed $10.6 trillion.
MCAT	Singapore shares are expected to find firmer footing early Monday supported by an improved outlook for the local economy, dealers said. The economy was expanding faster than expected and would grow at between six and seven percent in 1997, up from a revised five to seven percent, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said on Friday. This was seen putting some spark into the recently lifeless market riddled late last week by fears of possible termination of dual listings in 16 blue chips including the Big Four banks. But dealers cautioned the mood was still bearish as investors might continue to liquidate ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting on August 19 and uncertainties on dual listings. The latter triggered a fall in the foreign tranches and a rise in the local tranches last week. "The possible delisting of foreign tranches have shaken investors' confidence," a broker with a local house said. On Friday, the Straits Times Industrials Index ended 9.32 points down at 1,943.92.

MCAT	The Tokyo stock market's key index jumped to a new high for calendar 1997 on Thursday morning on continued optimism over the economy after a survey that showed a surprisingly upbeat mood among big manufacturers. After 15 minutes of trade the Nikkei 225 average was up 188.42 points or 0.91 percent at 20,867.69 after briefly rising to 20,882.19. The previous intra-day high for the year was set on June 13, when the Nikkei rose to 20,815.48. Its September futures added 110 points to reach 20,870. Brokers said gains were likely to be limited as euphoria stemming from the Bank of Japan's "tankan" survey of corporate sentiment could not last. The survey's release on Wednesday lifted investor confidence on the Tokyo bourse, wafting prices higher. "The near-term goal for the Nikkei is 20,800 as there are not enough factors apart from a good supply-demand situation to keep the index rising to 21,000 and beyond," a general manager at a foreign brokerage said.
GCAT	French Communist leader Robert Hue appealed for left-wing unity at the start of his party's reform congress on Wednesday but acknowledged important differences with the Socialists, the biggest opposition party. "We want union (of the Left). Not the union of the past which leads to a dead end and failure but a new union, without hegemony, rich in its diversity," Hue told the 1,100 delegates. A central issue at the five-day congress is the Communists' attitude towards a future single European currency, which may determine whether they can join a broad left alliance with the pro-European Socialists for the 1998 general election. For the first time since the 1950s, veteran former hardline leader Georges Marchais was absent. Marchais, 76, who announced recently he would retire from the politburo at this 29th party congress, is recovering from a heart attack last week. Hue took over as Marchais' hand-picked sucessor as national secretary in 1994 but has worked hard to transform the party, which still claims 275,000 members -- a figure regarded as inflated by independent political analysts. He jettisoned the remnants of "democratic centralism" and declared that, contrary to Marchais's dictum, Soviet communism was not "globally positive". He has refocused the party to fight "ultra-liberalism" and "the predatory globalisation of financiers". The jovial, rotund Hue, a popular figure with his cropped beard and round spectacles, has succeeded in halting the Communists' electoral decline. He won 8.6 percent in last year's presidential election. An independent CSA poll published on Wednesday said nine percent of voters would cast their ballot for a Communist candidate, and another 17 percent did not rule it out. For the first time, the policy document to be approved by the congress was drafted in conjunction with grassroots party cells and the congress will vote on amendments offered by both liberals and hardliners. The key test will be the single European currency. Hue has called for a referendum before France joins monetary union, but hardliners have put down amendments condemning the euro. That would make it harder for the party to team up with the Socialists if the Left wins the 1998 general election. In his speec, Hue called on the Communists to "rise to their responsibilities" and be willing to join a Socialist-led government in 1998 on the basis of a common platform. "Important differences remain between us on the question of money and of the single currency. Above all the Socialist Party persists in its old approach of ignoring pluralism by presenting its own programme as representing "the Left'," Hue said. "Our party has a duty to participate in government to ensure the implementation of a policy of change. We consider the action of Communist elected officials -- and of possible Communist ministers -- will relay citizens' demands to France's institutions and rulers." The Communisty party had four ministers in a Socialist-led government formed by the late president Francois Mitterrand in 1981, which carried out sweeping nationalisations. It withdrew in 1984, accusing Mitterrand of betraying the Left. In a sign of the times, the general-secretary of the Communist-dominated CGT trade union, Louis Viannet, is to give up his seat on the politburo, renamed the national bureau, although he will remain on the central committee. CGT rail union leader Bernard Thibault, who led a successful rail workers' strike last year, will take his place. Dissident economist Philippe Herzog, the only senior who favours European monetary union, is also to leave the politburo.

CCAT	The initial public offering of 2.1 million common shares of Spatial Technology Inc has been postponed due to "market conditions," lead underwriter Dain Bosworth Inc said Monday. The Boulder, Colo.-based company, which develops software used to create and modify three-dimensional shapes on a computer, was expected to make its market debut in mid- October on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "STGY." A syndicate representative at Dain Bosworth said he did not know if the deal, with an estimated value of $21 million and expected to price between $9 and $11 a share, would resurface.
CCAT	Blue chip Pakistan State Oil (PSO) jumped 27 rupees, or 7.78 percent, to 374 on Monday after the company announced favourable annual results, dealers said. A total 9,600 PSO shares had traded hands by mid-session. Taurus Securities said in a review that keeping in line with its tradition of high payouts, PSO announced a 30 percent cash and 30 percent bonus dividend. The company had already announced an interim dividend of 30 percent. "The market has responded positively to the PSO results and ended the speculations about the fall in its earnings," dealer Ambreen Shoukat of KASB & Co said. "The stock has a strong growth potential and low risk of a downside," the review by Taurus Securities said. Dealers said the recent 7.86 percent devaluation of the rupee against the dollar and a 10 percent rise in petroleum prices would boost company profits. PSO, Pakistan's largest oil company, has a market share of almost 75 percent in most petroleum products. -- Karachi newsroom 9221-5685192
GCAT	Italy told Albania's squabbling political parties on Monday that international aid for economic recovery in their violence-plagued country would not be possible without free and fair elections. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini sounded the warning in an opening speech to an international meeting in Rome on the crisis in Albania, Europe's poorest country, where early elections are scheduled for June 29. Preparations for the vote have been dogged by disputes over how they will be conducted and supervised. "Without the consolidation of the national reconciliation process, without elections, conducted in a safe and fair environment accroding to international standards, without rules of conduct shared and agreed by all parties in Albania, the conditions for recovery in the economic and financial fields will not be present," Dini said in his speech. "Therefore I urge Albania in a spirit of friendship to speed up the reconciliation process and to fully cooperate with the OSCE, especially in view of the forthcoming elections," he said. The meeting in Rome was being attended by Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino, European mediator Franz Vranitzky of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and senior diplomats from the European Union and the United States. Major international organisations, including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund were also present at the day-long talks, intended to prepare the way for a full ministerial conference on Albania, tentatively set for mid-June. Dini said the conference agenda should focus on political as well as economic and financial issues. Albania vitally needs the election to restore law and order after anger over the collapse of get-rich-quick pyramid investment schemes erupted in February and March into rebellion against President Sali Berisha. Although the situation has calmed since the arrival in April of an Italian-led multinational security force, large swathes of the country remain outside government control. More than a million weapons looted during the troubles have fallen into private hands. Fino, of the opposition Socialists, heads a nine-party interim national unity government installed in March to lead the Balkan country up until the elections. Berisha has been at odds with the government over several issues and on Sunday rejected a cabinet call to lift a curfew before next month's elections. The curfew was established under a state of emergency imposed in March by the outgoing parliament, which was dominated by Berisha's Democratic Party. Berisha dissolved the assembly in early May in preparation for the elections.
MCAT	Zimbabwean shares opened the week mixed to weak on continuing profit-taking on Monday with brokers maintaining the bourse would pick up again on high expectations of lower interest rates. The industrial index -- which last Monday scaled the 7,000 psychological barrier for the first time ever -- dropped 38.41 points to close at 6,714.98. "We think it's a temporary breather after the bull-run and the market should pick up again because on the macro-economic level the stock exchange is a much more attractive home for investment than the money market," one broker said. He was referring to a fall in money market rates over the past six months which have driven investors seeking higher yields to the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. On the exchange on Monday, merchant banker FMB slid 100 cents to 3,300, tyre manufacturer NTS dropped 50 cents to 450, glass firm PGI shed 30 cents to 490 and tyre manufacturer Dunlop and textiler Spinweave lost 15 cents each to 200 and 140 respectively. Cable manufacturer BICAF at 390, tea and coffee producer EHPL at 125, building company J and F at 190, tobacco firm TSL at 500, finance group Finhold at 890 all shed 10 cents. Blue-chip conglomerate Delta and pork processor Colcom traded unchanged in reasonable turnover but industrial holding group IHL surged 550 to 4,200, food group Cairns gained 50 cents to 850, clothing retailer Truworths added five cents to 780 as did multi-industrial group Mash at 135. Minings were also quiet and easier in light trade with gold producer Falgold dropping 100 cents to 1,700, nickel giant Bindura losing 50 cents to 1,150, Falgold shedding 10 cents to 170 and Wankie Colliery easing five cents down to 350.

ECAT	The Yugoslav central bank on Friday vowed to keep its tight monetary policy unchanged until the end of 1996 despite some positive indicators, a central bank official said on Friday. "The central bank has no reasons to change anything in its current policy," the central bank vice-governor Ratko Banovic told Reuters. "There will be no relaxation in the central bank monetary policy, and we will not be mislead by any temporarily encouraging data that could provoke some easing," Banovic said. The basic strategy remains, and if some evidence of growing instability occurs, the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) would have to tighten its policy further, he added. Banovic described the third quarter of this year as unusually stable. "We have not witnessed such stability for several years. Normally those three summer months would bring the first toublesome signs that explode during the last quarter of the year," he said. The NBY's tight monetary policy also closely matches the demands of the International Monetary Fund for expected normalisation of relations. "We have the necessary degree of restrictiveness and with Yugoslavia rejoining international financial institutions, we look for an increased credit activity. We would begin to receive foreign credits, and hard currency inflow would take the pressure off the demand for dinars," Banovic said. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254
GCAT	The trial resumed on Thursday at the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda of former Rwandan mayor Jean Paul Akayesu, accused of genocide in 1994. The hearing, postponed since March 7, began with defence lawyer Patrice Monthe of Cameroon cross-examining expert prosecution witness Allison des Forges, a historian and human rights activist. Des Forges said late Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana exploited an attack by rebels in 1990 as an ethnic issue to unite the Hutu majority against the Tutsi minority and regain popularity. "He had lost a lot of popularity among the Hutu and so he wanted to create the pretext of the attack and blame it on the Tutsi so that he could lead the attack against them," she said. "It was Habyarimana who invented the idea that Hutu and Tutsi were enemies," she told the court. The trial continues. Some 800,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates were slaughtered in a genocide in Rwanda in 1994 by Hutu troops, militiamen and mobs sparked by Habyarimana's assassination when his plane exploded. Monthe apologised to the court at tribunal headquarters in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha for not being present on Wednesday for the scheduled hearing because of flight problems. Akayesu was mayor of Taba commune and has pleaded not guilty to genocide and crimes against humanity. He was the first suspect to go on trial last year at the tribunal, which can impose the maximum penalty of life imprisonment on conviction. The tribunal assigned a Swiss lawyer to defend a Rwandan businessman transferred to detention in Arusha from a Swiss jail to face charges of genocide in 1994. Tribunal officials said no date had been set for the initial appearance by Alfred Musema, who was a tea factory director in Rwanda in 1994 and was flown from Switzerland to Arusha this week. The indictment against Musema, 47, accuses him of bringing armed groups to the area of Bisesero in western Rwanda and directing them to attack Tutsis seeking refuge. It says he himself attacked and killed refugees at Bisesero. Musema came to Switzerland seeking political asylum but was arrested in February 1995 based on information from U.N. investigators. A Swiss court rejected his appeal to stay there. A total of 12 Rwandans are in tribunal detention in Arusha. The tribunal has indicted 21 people. A U.N. inquiry said it was plagued by mismanagement and several officials have been replaced.

GCAT	Defenseman Steve Smith, a three-time Stanley Cup winner with the Edmonton Oilers, announced his retirement from the Chicago Blackhawks Friday. Smith was a mainstay on the Oilers' defense from 1985 until his trade to Chicago for Dave Manson in 1991. He played for the Blackhawks until this past season, though he was limited to 58 games in the last two seasons. "I appreciate what Smitty added to our club over the last few seasons," Blackhawks coach Craig Hartsburg said. "His leadership will be missed in the locker room, and his presence will be missed on the ice." In his 13-year career, Smith played 702 regular-season games and 134 playoff contests. In the regular season, he had 71 goals, 283 assists and 354 points with exactly 2,000 penalty minutes. He scored 11 playoff goals and added 41 assists for 52 points while tacking on 288 minutes. Smith was a rugged performer and paid the price. With the exception of the lockout-shortened 1994-95 campaign, he never played every game in a season. Despite a standout career as a leader, Smith might best be remembered for shooting the puck off the skate of his own goaltender, Grant Fuhr, to give the Calgary Flames a 3-2 victory over Edmonton in the seventh game of their 1986 playoff series. The game was headed for overtime, but instead the Oilers went home without the Stanley Cup for the only time in a span of five-years.
CCAT	Shares in steelmaker Sidel were up 8.50 francs at 329.50 at 1410 GMT in brisk trading. Traders attributed the rise to the group's recent presentation to U.S. investors and some mentioned talk that the group had won a big contract with Coca-Cola in Asia. Others said it was due for a rebound after a sharp fall in September on disappointing half-year results. Officials at the company were not immediately available for comment. Turnover totalled 590,300 shares.

MCAT	COMEX copper ended weaker in lackluster rangebound trade as new, lower margins came in force after close of trade. The New York market was quiet and dominated by local activity with LME was closed Monday due to a U.K. public holiday. LME reopens Tuesday but with no regular stock report. The COMEX copper margin per futures contract was cut to $1,600 from $2,100 for clearing members, members and hedgers, and to $2,160 from $2,835 for speculators. "In theory this should be more supportive for copper," said Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential Securities. The margins were raised on COMEX and LME to dampen post-Sumitomo volatility. December COMEX settled 0.40 cent lower at 89.60 cents, traded 89.90 to 89.45 cents. September went out 0.60 cents weaker at 91.10 cents. Volume was estimated at 4,000 lots. The market appeared to shrug off uncertainties in labor talks at Phelps Dodge's Chino mine where the contract expired June 30, at Codelco's Salvador mine, where the current deal ends September 1, and at Kennecott which expires at end of September, Raptopoulos noted. -- Huw Jones, New York Commodities 212-859-1646

MCAT	Most Polish shares fell in higher turnover on Friday but gains by a few heavyweights pushed the main index up and analysts said further gains were possible on Monday following continuous trade rises. The main market's WIG index rose 94.8 points, or 0.6 percent, to 16,376.9, and turnover rose 19 percent to 172 million zlotys ($55.5 million) on all three markets as 51 issues fell, 28 rose and 13 were flat. Analysts said, however, any strong gains were unlikely as the bourse was in a horizontal trend with investor interest shifting to several attractive primary market offerings. "I think there might be growth (on Monday), as most stocks traded higher in the continuous trade than at fixing, but I think generally we have consolidation phase," said Ryszard Sikora, an analyst at Bank Slaski brokerage. Analysts said companies earnings reports for March, most of them due later on Friday could influence individual stock performance, but said their impact on the market as a whole was very limited. On Monday Kredyt Bank starts its 83-million zloty ($26.8 million) offering and metals trader Impexmetal SA starts initial public offering estimated at 222 million zlotys ($71.6 million). Analysts also said Thursday and Friday sessions, which did not follow Dow Jones previous day's performance, signalled that recent Polish speculator's trend to imitate Wall Street's daily movements could end. In the continuous trade eight stocks rose and eight were flat with the WIG 20 index close at 1,635.7 points, one percent higher than at the regular session.

MCAT	Most CBOT corn futures made fresh contract lows again early Thursday, under pressure from good crop weather in the U.S. Midwest, traders said. Traders said Wednesday's National Weather Service six- to 10-day outlook was bearish for corn futures. The NWS forecast indicated normal temperatures and above normal precipitation in the Midwest from July 1 to July 5. USDA's weekly export sales report was also characterized as neutral to bearish for corn futures, the traders said. At 0730 CDT, USDA said net export sales of old crop corn during the week ended June 19 were 356,000 tonnes, within the range of expectations for 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes. But new crop corn sales at 226,600 tonnes were below expectations for 350,000 to 500,000 tonnes. In early trade, Refco sold four million bushels of December, and Smith Barney and FIMAT Futures each sold two million bushels December, pit traders said. At 1010 CDT, July corn futures were 3-1/4 cent per bushel lower at $2.53-1/2, and other months were 1/2 to 1-1/2 cents lower. ((Anna Driver 312-408-8720))
CCAT	India will allow the Surface Transport Ministry to take decisions independently on all road projects involving investment of up to two billion rupees ($56 million), a government spokesman said on Thursday. "The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure (CCI) met on Wednesday and decided to give more power to the Surface Transport Ministry," the spokesman told a news conference. Earlier, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs and the Public Investment Board had to clear projects worth more than 500 million rupees, he said. He said the CCI also decided to allow the Surface Transport Ministry to independently decide on projects with investment between two billion and five billion rupees in consultation with the Finance Ministry's expenditure department. The committee also gave preliminary approval to providing traffic guarantees to investors and lenders in build-operate-transfer highway projects, the spokesman said. He said it also approved in principle the National Highway Authority of India's plan to issue road bonds. The CCI also approved in principle offers from Malaysian and Singapore-based firms to develop specific sections of national highways, and will fix certain conditions to toll rates at a later date, the government spokesman said. He said the committee also decided to allow the import of bitumen multigrade coal, for which the rate of duty would later be fixed by the Finance Ministry. The spokesman said the CCI asked the Surface Transport Ministry to frame guidelines and principles for allowing Indian ports to form joint ventures with modern ports abroad. The committee expressed concerns about productivity in infrastructure industries and asked administrative ministries to take steps to achieve growth rates, the spokesman said. It set annual growth targets of seven percent for power, 6.4 percent for coal, 3.5 percent for petroleum, 10 percent for fertilisers, nine percent for export cargo, 25 percent for telecommunications and seven perccent for revenue on railway goods, he added. The committee will fix the target for saleable steel in September, he said. --New Delhi newsroom +91 11 301 2024
CCAT	SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 1 (REUTER) - Intel Corp cut prices Friday on its Pentium Pro, its most advanced line of microprocessors, despite evidence of tightening supplies. But prices of Pentiums, its mainstream microprocessors, were left unchanged, under a price plan announced in August. Intel traditionally cuts prices of its microprocessors four times a year to propel sales. Intel spokesman Howard High said the firm proceeded with the planned cuts in the Pentium Pro line because it told computer manufacturers about November price levels some time ago.   "We share projected prices quite far in advance with our customers so they can make their business plans. We kind of have a commitment now," High said. The price cuts are not as deep as they have been in the past, he said. High added that the supply tightening is not anything near a shortage, but instead marked a lengthening of order advance time from a "just in time" situation. He said the supply situation also resulted from very strong demand for high-end microprocessors.   Intel in August announced it would forego its November price cuts on its mainstream Pentiums so it would not disrupt the fall PC manufacturing and selling season. Price cuts often incite manufacturers to hold off building PCs until they can get the lower-priced parts. Intel said the new price of 200-megahertz Pentium Pros with 512 kilobits of cache, or memory, was $1035 per chip, down from $1072, for orders of 1,000. The price of 166-megahertz Pentium Pros with 512 kilobits of cache was $627, down from $665. For 200-megahertz Pentium Pros with 256 kilobits of cache, the price fell to $525 from $562. And 180-megahertz Pentium Pros with 256 kilobits of cache now cost $428, compared with $482.
MCAT	French bonds slipped on Thursday as a lack of follow through buying at a government bond auction and mild disappointment that German rates were left unchanged punctured earlier optimism sparked by weak German data. A larger than expected rise in German unemployment fueled a wave of buying of cash bonds by primary dealers, hoping the figures would boost rate cut expectations, but when the futures market stalled they cut their positions, traders said. "The SVTs (primary dealers) took a beating," a trader at a U.S. house in Paris said. "People went long before the auction, some saw the (bond future) at 129.90, which didn't happen."   "Then they cut their positions," he said. The head of a French futures brokerage said, "We had good cash buying from primary dealers this morning. After the auction they felt the market was weak and they started to lighten" their positions. "People don't want to be too long at the moment so we had some profit taking," he said. Analysts said although the French market remained relatively well supported by domestic investors, who were still buying bonds at the lows for the day, a decline in the U.S. bond market was setting the overall tone.   Joanne Perez, stratgist at Merrill Lynch, said, "The market got quite excited after the German (unemployment) figures and went long before the auction but there was no follow through." The Treasury said it sold 17.35 of OATs on Thursday with most demand coming for the variable rate TEC 10 OAT. However the overall bid to cover ratio of 2.6 was lower than at recent auctions. Perez said traders were wary about remaining long at the highs with U.S. jobs figures on Friday which were unlikely to be that helpful. "Independently we're pretty well supported with domestics buying on dips, but you've got the U.S. trend."   A head futures trader at a French bank said he thought the French market "had purged itself" and should rebound unless there's bad U.S. news. PIBOR contracts lost their early gains after both the Bundesbank and the Bank of France left interest rates unchanged. The March contract climbed as high as 96.65, within a whisker of the contract high at 96.66, but fell back to settle unchanged at 96.60. The two-year spread widened slightly to 10 basis points from nine yesterday and as low as six earlier in the week. -- David Clarke, Paris Newsroom +331 4221 5542   The key U.S. non-farm payroll release for November, due at 1330 GMT on Friday, was expected to show a 179,000 rise in the number of new jobs created. Continued weakness in the U.S. bond market ahead of the jobs report dragged the French bond future lower in the GLOBEX session though it bounced off support at 128.80 to trade at 128.94 at 1620 GMT. Nevertheless, it was a more optimistic day in the options market with more than 12,000 January calls trading at a strike price of 131. The contract expires on December 26.
GCAT	U.N. refugee chief Sadako Ogata left for Kisangani, headquarters of Zaire's counter-offensive against rebels in the east, on Saturday but security concerns put in doubt a planned trip to refugees trapped by the war. Relief officials said that Ogata, who is looking for ways of repatriating up to 300,000 Rwandan Hutus, might fly over the area if she was unable as planned to visit 120,000 weak and frightened refugees clustered around Tingi Tingi village. On the battle front, both Zairean military officials and rebels reported fighting at the gold and tin mining town of Punia, about 70 km (45 miles) south of Lubutu, which is close to Tingi Tingi. Ogata told reporters in the capital Kinshasa on Friday that she was looking at repatriation options with the government, whose forces are battling the Tutsi-led rebels for control of a string of towns on several fronts. "In theory, there are two ways of repatriating the refugees, by plane or by road through safety corridors," she said. In New York, the U.N. Security Council called for an end to hostilities, the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Zaire, including mercenaries, and demanded that combatants respect the rights of refugees. The refugees and Hutu hardliners blamed for the 1994 genocide of minority Tutsis in Rwanda fled west in December after attacks on their camps in the east. Many more fellow Hutus opted to return home, treking en masse in the other direction. Relief agencies pulled their international staff out of Tingi Tingi and Lubutu on Friday, saying panicky Zairean soldiers fired in the air and demanded money and vehicles from aid agencies. Lubutu is 200 km (125 miles) from Kisangani. Aid workers reported refugees fleeing towards Lubutu from Amisi, further down the road to the rebel-held east. The rebels responded to the much-trumpeted government counter-offensive by attacking on several fronts. Both sides have reported the fall or recapture of a handful of towns in the war zone, which stretches from a corner of the mineral-rich southern province of Shaba to the northeast. Rebels say they hold a large strip of territory along the borders with Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. Zaire, which accuses Rwanda and Uganda of invading in support of the rebels, said on Friday its army had retaken Watsa in the north east and Shabunda in the east. Zairean officials spoke of killing 800 rebels and taking Ugandan soldiers prisoners at Watsa. In the past, they have displayed Ugandan and Rwandan prisoners in Kinshasa. Veteran President Mobutu Sese Seko, meanwhile, returned to his Gbadolite jungle palace on Friday after medical tests in Europe. Mobutu, who had prostate surgery in August, denied asking Morocco for military help on a visit on his way home.

ECAT	Monday is the deadline for payment of back taxes on thousands of properties in Philadelphia, ahead of a key vote this week on a plan to sell the city's outstanding tax liens. As part of a plan to securitize the liens, Philadelphia officials have stepped up collection efforts. Hundreds of residents have paid back property taxes or made payment arrangements, under the threat that the city would sell the outstanding liens to more aggressive private collection agencies. Although a vote is scheduled for later this week, it remains unclear whether enough city council members support the tax lien sale. Several have expressed concern that the collection agencies would force poor residents out of their homes. Pressure to pass the tax lien legislation is expected from Mayor Ed Rendell because the revenue is needed for both the city and the Philadelphia School District. --U.S. Municipal Desk, 212-859-1650
CCAT	Australian geotechnical survey specialist Aerodata Holdings said on Tuesday it was prepared to offer 55p per share to shareholders in British oil services company Scott Pickford Plc if it could agree terms. Aerodata already has a cross-shareholding arrangement with Scott Pickford, and planned to extend this to an operational collaboration over time, but saw its plans thrown into jeopardy by a recent full takeover bid for Scott Pickford launched by U.S. company Core Laboratories NV.   Aerodata said in its statement it was in talks with Scott Pickford "with a view to formalising an offer valued at 55p per share", but such an offer would be subject to the board of Scott Pickford recommending it at that price level. Earlier this month Core made a cash offer at 53p, valuing the British company at about 6.7 million pounds, and Aerodata's initial response was to say it would be prepared to match this. However, Core then raised by 4p to 57p on the condition that a planned share exchange betweeen Scott and Aerodata be stopped. At the centre of the triangle, Scott has declined to make a decisive move in either direction so far and has continued to recommend its shareholders to take no action. In its Tuesday statement, Aerodata also said it wished to take issue with Core's reporting of bid acceptances. On Monday Core said it had won acceptances totalling 47.56 percent of Scott's shares, comprising 14.99 percent who had accepted the 53p bid and another 32.57 percent who had signed up for the conditional 57p offer. Aerodata, which has begun a legal challenge to enforce its share exchange plan, said that Core could only claim to have 14.99 percent as irrevocable acceptances, and called the remainder "imply non-legally binding statements of intent". -- Andrew Huddart, London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7717

This sentiment should prevail until the rights issue of OTE is completed, he added. State telecoms OTE plans a large rights issue and part-flotation in June. Foreign portfolios continued to off-load large holdings in large private banks and select construction stocks on interest rate and forex jitters but domestic buying interest snapped up most of the offer. "We may see foreign portfolios continuing sales of Alpha Credit , ErgoBank and Michaniki until short-term rates and the forex market completely return to normal conditions," Karydis said. But buyers consistently outstrip sellers and prices rebound despite temporary weakness, he added. In the previous week, the equity market's foreign component was spooked by a hike in interbank rates in response to a weaker drachma. The market was seen very sensitive to short-run interbank rates which had played a key role in shaping up sentiment. "Market participants have grown very sensitive to short-term interest rates. A halt in the downward trend of interest rates appears to be a sufficient reason to reverse the favourable market sentiment," said Karydis. The Athens general index added 1.90 percent or 31.39 points to end at 1,684.38 from Monday's close at 1,652.99. It opened on a firm note at 1,673 points and set an intra-day high of 1,697.52 shortly after. Industrials led the market with a 2.93 percent rise, followed by banks which appreciated 1.28 percent. The market saw continuing good levels of turnover. Tuesday's turnover amounted to 27.2 billion drachmas on volume of 5.2 million shares, including several blocks. Advancing stocks beat decliners 124 to 91 with 28 shares unchanged on 243 traded. The Merrill Lynch call spread warrant on OTE with a strike price of 3,800 drachmas was quoted higher at 1,119-1,149. Shares of OTE telecom , the underlying, firmed 200 drachmas to 7,400 drachmas. The Merrill Lynch American call warrant on a basket of 23 Greek equities that are part of the Athens general index was quoted higher at 708.88-754.13. The warrants expire January 9 1998. The ING Baring Financial Products American style call warrant based on a basket of six bank stocks was quoted higher at $86.55-$88.24. The strike price is set at $99.60 and the warrants expire October 8, 1997. The ING Baring Financial Products American-style call warrant on a basket of six blue-chips denominated in drachmas was quoted higher at 4,356-4,593 drachmas. The strike price is set at 10,000 drachmas and the warrants expire on February 2, 1998. The ING Baring American-style second call warrant on a basket of six bank stocks was quoted at $19.11-N/O. The strike price is set at $110.0 and the warrants expire April 9 1998. The recently launched ING Baring American-style, drachma- denominated call warrant on the bourse's benchmark index was quoted higher at 297-331 drachmas. The strike price is set at 1,639 points and the warrants expire May 14 1998. --Angelos Kiosklis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
CCAT	British carpet retailer Carpetright Plc said on Tuesday sales in the first 12 weeks of the current financial year were up 25 percent on last year.   The company said its share of the market was now in the region of 17 percent. "With a growing economy and a carpet market that continues to strengthen after a slow start in May, we are looking to continued growth during the rest of our year," chairman and chief executive Lord Harris told the annual general meeting. He said in a statement that the company had opened four Carpetright stores and seven Carpet Depots since April, bringing the totals to 212 and 64 respectively. "We expect to open a total of 39 stores during this financial year and, as a result of MFI Homeworks conversions, have a major opportunity over the next two years to open many new stores and to extend some of our smaller stores," Lord Harris added. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 4365

ECAT	Portugal cut three official interest rates on Monday in a sign that the government had tightened its grip on inflation, opening the way for further cuts in the repurchase rate in the coming weeks. The Bank of Portugal said it cut its repurchase rate a tenth of a percentage point, or 10 basis points, to 6.90 percent and the draining rate, the rate at which it absorbs excess market liquidity, 40 basis points to 6.40 percent, effective Tuesday. The central bank also cut its emergency lending rate by half a point to 8.50 percent, effective Tuesday, the start of a new seven-day commercial bank reserve period. The Bank's draining rate had stood at 6.8 percent since April 19. The repo rate was last cut on October 21 when the Bank of Portugal shaved a tenth of a point off to 7.0 percent. Analysts had forecast rate cuts, but the drop in the draining rate was larger than the 15- to 30-basis point reduction they had expected. The cut in the repurchase rate was in line with forecasts of 10 to 15 basis points. Better-than-expected inflation figures for October had increased the Bank's room for manoeuvre, analysts said. "Given the good inflation news, the rate cuts were not too surprising," said economist Keith Edmonds of IBJ International in London. In October, inflation dipped 0.1 percent month-on-month, which brought the year-on-year rate to three percent. The 12-month rolling average, the government's benchmark, slipped to 3.2 percent from 3.3 percent in September. Edmonds echoed the views of operators in Lisbon who said the latest rate cuts would probably be followed by further repo rate cuts in the coming weeks. He said he believed the repo rate would drop to around 6.50 percent by the end of this year and that the draining rate could ease again early next year. "The government has shown that it is adopting a restrictive monetary policy and is keeping the exchange rate stable," he said. "Its fiscal policy has also been following a disciplined course," he added. The government's 1997 budget proposals, now being discussed in fine detail by parliament, keep a tight lid on spending and forecast a strong boost to revenues to meet the tough entry test for joining the European single currency in January 1999. The budget is expected to be passed by parliament in a final vote on December 11. Economists said Portugal had shown good progress to reduce inflation. "I don't see inflation as the most difficult target for Portugal to achieve (to join the single currency)," said Sally Wilkinson, an economist with UBS in London. She said the battle to bring the budget deficit to within three percent of Gross Domestic Product to qualify for entry to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) would be tougher. Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said last month that Portugal had room to cut interest rates further and that inflation would be the toughest target to meet for entry to EMU. Portuguese bonds, which had anticipated the rate cuts, traded at all-time highs on Monday, dealers said. Shares on Lisbon bourse failed to react, but dealers said buying interest could increase in coming weeks.
CCAT	Zions Bancorp said Monday its subsidiary Zions First National Bank completed the acquisition of a private California financial advisory firm for an undisclosed amount. "The purchase price is not a material amount," a Zions spokesman said. He added the firm, Kelling, Northcross and Nobriga Co, mostly advises small municipalities and has about 20 employees. The firm completed 80 transactions with a total of $737 million in bond issues for municipalities, school districts and other public entities in 1996, Zions said.   Zions has been on a buying spree this year. On May 18, it completed its acquisition of Aspen Bancshares Inc of Aspen, Colo., exchanging 0.7387 Zions shares for one Aspen share. The companies first announced the $75 million deal in November last year. On May 1, it said it agreed to buy Tri-State Bank, an Idaho bank with $24 million in assets in another all-stock transaction. On March 7, Zions said it would buy 32 Wells Fargo and Co branches in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada and Utah for 6.17 percent of the branches' deposits of $550 million plus the real estate's book value. The company said it expected to close the deal in July. Zion's stock closed at 36-3/8 Monday afternoon, down 1-1/8 but close to the 52-week high of 37-3/4 it hit on Thursday.
ECAT	The higher-than-expected 1.9 percent rise in Polish consumer prices in September is seen delaying a central bank interest rate cut until the first quarter of 1997, analysts said on Tuesday. Markets expected the CPI index to rise month-on-month 1.4 percent in September, while the finance ministry and central bank said the year-on-year index would fall to 19 percent from 20.5 percent in August. "The (government) target of 17 percent year-on-year inflation in 1996 is pure fiction...and the next possible interest rate cut is not likely to happen before early 1997," Pawel Krawczykiewicz, analyst at PBI SA, told Reuters. The Central Statistical Office said on Tuesday the September month-on-month price growth was 1.9 percent against 0.5 percent rise in August which took the year-on-year index down to 19.5 percent from 21.6 percent in December 1995. @ Krawczykiewicz said he expected year-on-year inflation to ease to about 18.7 percent at the end of the year, still to high for the National Bank of Poland to pare its official interest rates, now at 25 and 22 percent. The NBP last lowered rates by one percent on July 16, but year-on-year inflation rebounded from June's low of 19.5 percent July's high at 20.5 percent. "We thought that there might be room to pare rates before the end of the year, but with 1996 inflation likely around 19 percent, any rate cut will likely wait until January figures are known," said Piotr Kazimierczyk, chief economist at PBR SA. Last month the NBP, worried by the fast growth of credit to households and the possibility of a boom in imports, said it would strive to keep real interest rates rising in the near-term to protect the country's current account. Analysts expected prices to continue to grow in the coming months, propelled by October's five percent rise in utility prices and increases in petrol and diesel prices. "Long delayed government controlled price hikes are likely to keep (year-ony-ear) inflation from falling and may keep it from reaching the 15 percent level at the end of 1997," Kazimierczyk said. Analysts also said indexed increases of government sector wages and pensions, to compensate for the higher 1996 inflation now likely top the 17 percent budget plan, would create additional inflation impulses. "Enterprise sector wages have been growing at six percent in real terms this year and public sector wages will grow as well, which may cause an inflationary demand surge," said Tadeusz Chroscicki, chief analyst at the Planning Ministry. Analysts said food prices, which grew by 2.7 percent in September and were at year-on-year 20.2 percent, were not likely to dramatically slow their pace of growth this year because of incrased demand around Christmas. Some were sour over the Finance Minster Grzegorz Kolodko and the central bank's statements that year-on-year inflation would fall to around 19 percent in September, saying that such information was mis-leading and did not reflect facts. "Kolodko and the central bank again showed a good face to bad cards, they should stop doing this if they want a mature market," one analyst at a Polish bank said.
CCAT	Patriot American Hospitality Inc is in talks to acquire Wyndham Hotel Corp, the Wall Street Journal said Wednesday in its electronic edition. Both companies declined comment in the report, but people familiar with the discussions believe Wyndham would become Patriot's management arm and operate the upscale hotels Patriot acquires, the report said. The report said Wyndham's stock has been climbing and is up about 20 percent in the past week. Wyndham shares closed up 1/4 Tuesday at 30-1/8. Patriot shares closed down 1-1/8 at 44-1/8.

ECAT	Economists and business leaders alike on Tuesday declared North Korea's ground-breaking forum on foreign investment a success. But the three-day meeting at the Rajin-Sonbong free trade zone that ended on Sunday would have to be followed up by concrete action from the government and a demonstration that investments would be profitable, participants said. The forum attracted 450 business representatives, academics and media from 26 countries. Many were aboard this ferry from Rajin to Japan on Tuesday. At least $280 million in foreign-funded contracts was announced, primarily in the accommodation and tourism sector, including an agreement for a $180 million five-star hotel and casino by Hong Kong's Emperor group. An additional $550 million was pledged to the zone in light manufacturing, oil processing and infrastructure upgrade. Most investment came from Chinese and overseas Korean companies who predominated among the forum participants. South Korean companies pulled out of the event after their government announced a boycott, although many chaebol (conglomerates) are said to be in negotiations with the North Korean government on operations in Rajin-Sonbong. Earlier on Tuesday, the Hong Kong office of North Korea's Committee for the Promotion of External Economic Cooperation invited 150 South Koreans to a four-day forum in Rajin-Sonbong. Economists said news of the investment deals was good for the North Korean economy as a whole but much more would be needed to revive its stricken industry. "The cost of rebuilding the economy will be something in the order of half to $1 trillion. Three hundred million is just a drop in the bucket," said Marcus Noland, senior fellow with the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "Nonetheless, the process appears to be a success in Rajin-Sonbong, and I hope the effects might be taken to other parts of the country," he said. Businessmen who chose to invest said teaching North Koreans how to function in the real world was vital for the future of the Korean Peninsula. "I want to give them our know-how, and I believe they are serious about moving forward. Business is the only way we can encourage them to work with the South Koreans constructively," said Masao Matsubara, who filed a letter of intent with the free trade zone to construct a $3 million oil filter recycling plant near Rajin harbour. Matsubara added, "I'm going to work as hard as possible to bring the North and South together." Many Japanese businesses attended the forum but took a more cautious approach. Sung Kuk Oh, president of Mitsui & Co in Korea, told Reuters, "Japanese companies won't move forward until the United States opens a representative office in Pyongyang. It's a matter of trust and reliability, and in that regard an American presence would be useful." Keith Chiddy, manager of the Dutch ING Bank branch in Pyongyang said, "For the first time a large number of people have seen the country and put together some ideas about the zone. Clearly, the time is right for government-level discussion and business activity." Marcus Noland added, "My impression is that North Korean policy makers are like people who have seen a video on tennis and want to play, but have never struck a ball with a racket before." Asked about his advice for foreign companies who wish to operate in North Korea, Chiddy said, "My advice would be to come as soon as possible. There is a limited number of staff who can communicate in foreign languages and the ability of North Korea to absorb foreign investments will also be limited."
CCAT	Gainesville-based Century South Banks Inc and Macon-based Bank Corp of Georgia said Monday they signed a statement of intent to merge the two bank holding companies.

MCAT	Shanghai soybean futures ended mixed on Thursday on uncertainty about the short-term market trend, traders said. The key November 1997 contract ended at an intraday low of 3,288 yuan ($397) per tonne, losing 11 yuan. It opened at a high of 3,300 yuan per tonne. July rose 103 to 3,260, September five to 3,258, the January 1998 contract fell 64 to 3,236 and March put on five to 3,300 yuan per tonne. Combined volume rose to 26,800 tonnes from 14,800 tonnes.   "Longs and shorts fought intensely around the 3,300 yuan level today but soybeans met strong resistance above that level," one trader said. "A lack of speculative money will keep the long position holders weak in the long run," he said. Traders said they expected soybeans to consolidate around current levels on Friday.

CCAT	Hubei Sanonda Co Ltd's 100 million B share issue debuted on the Shenzhen stock exchange on Thursday at HK$6.00, up HK$2.52 or 72.41 percent, but analysts said they expected it to surrender some of the gains later in the day.   "I am not sure if this is a fair value for the stock judging by the volatile market sentiment," an analyst at China Guotai Securities said. Analysts said they expected Sanonda's foreign currency B shares to slip back to between HK$4.00 and HK$5.00 in the short term against the issue price of HK$3.48. The pesticide maker's B share issue last month was 10 times oversubscribed, analysts said. The offer carried a price/earnings ratio of 8.78 times based on forecast 1997 net profits on a fully diluted basis under international accounting standards. Profits after tax but before exceptional items are expected to be more than 114 million yuan in 1997, the company has said.
MCAT	KCBT hard red winter wheat futures closed higher, boosted partly by bullish sentiment on charts and stronger than expected weekly U.S. export sales, dealers said. "Technical trade ruled the roost," one dealer said. They noted that the market had broken out of its recent trading range on the key September contract, with the day's peak of $3.79 a bushel the highest level since June 13. September ended up three cents at $3.76 a bushel. The close was seen as technically constructive as it was above Wednesday's high of $3.74 and previous resistance at $3.75. Other months finished 3-1/4 to 2-3/4 cents higher. Dealers said there was heavy fund buying with E.D. and F. Man buying 3.0 million bushels September and 1.0 million December and Rosenthal Collins 3.5 million September. They also noted Wolcott bought 1.0 million bushels September and 2.0 million December. Other supportive factors included slightly stronger than expected U.S. weekly net export sales of 765,100 tonnes, above a forecast range of 650,000 to 750,000. The Canadian Wheat Board also put Western Canadian production at a lower than expected 21.6 million tonnes. Last year Western Canada produced 29.5 million tonnes. Volume was estimated at 48.2 million bushels, up from 31.8 million on Wednesday. ((-Nigel Hunt 312-408 8720))
ECAT	Brazil unveiled on Friday a package of measures to curb federal spending, eliminate government jobs and increase tax collection. State companies will also be made to sell non-operational assets in the drive to reduce the country's fiscal deficit. Finance Minister Pedro Malan said the package was aimed at aiding passage of constitutional reforms sitting in Congress. "We believe this fiscal adjustment gives continuity to our efforts to approve constitutional reform in Congress, which we will not abandon," Malan told reporters. Major reforms to Brazil's pension and tax systems and the civil service have gotten bogged down in Congress with little chance of approval until well into 1997. Malan said the new measures could bring Brazil's deficit under 2.5 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, down from an expected 3.5 percent this year and 5 percent in 1995. More than 100,000 civil service posts will be eliminated in the federal government, and another 94,000 posts will be axed in state-owned firms. But 2,000 new tax officials will be hired to boost the government's tax revenues and crack down on tax debtors.
GCAT	The players and coach of Spanish side Real Betis have hit back at critics who accused them of not trying in Saturday's 1-0 defeat by Sporting Gijon, a result that helped condemn local rivals Sevilla to relegation. "We can't have a load on our conscience because of the poor seasons of others," said coach Serra Ferrer. During the game Betis fans cheered the Sporting goal and booed offside decisions made against the visitors. The match attracted a flood of criticism, principally from managers of other teams threatened by relegation. "I had to turn the television off. I had never seen a team go out to lose," said Maximo Hernandez of Rayo Vallecano. "Betis will pay in time. History doesn't forgive ... they will pay for it," said Espanyol's Paco Flores. Betis captain Alexis Trujillo was quick to reply to the attacks. "They are excuses to remove importance from their defeats," said Trujillo, "The fans' reaction was justified because they had to suffer a lot of pain in recent years." After years of playing second fiddle to their neighbours, Betis have already qualified for Europe and reached the Spanish Cup final. Sevilla, who have twice in the past been accused of throwing games to harm Betis, are former winners of the cup and league and have been perennial UEFA Cup hopefuls in recent years. But the club have struggled since narrowly escaping relegation to the third division for accountancy irregularities in the summer of 1995. A series of boardroom scandals unleashed by the incident has coincided with a run of bad luck on the field. The problems saw both Brazilian striker Bebeto and Argentine manager Carlos Bilardo come and go during the season.

GCAT	South Africa stung Zambia with two quick goals as they moved a step closer to next year's finals in France with a 3-0 World Cup qualifying win on Sunday. The African champions, seeking their first appearance in the finals, now need to beat Congo in their final qualifier at home next month to make sure of a trip to France. Goals from Helman Mkhalele and Phil Masinga in the first 16 minutes effectively ended the Zambian challenge and their World Cup hopes. Mark Williams added a third after 74 minutes to seal South Africa's victory. Mkhalele gave the home team the perfect start after nine minutes when he was allowed to run at the Zambian defence and fire home from the edge of the penalty area. The winger then turned provider for the second goal  when a deflection landed at Mkhalele's feet and played the perfect square ball for Masinga to tuck away. Zambia fought gallantly for much of the match but were unable to find a way through a South African defence expertly marshalled by captain Lucas Radebe. Andrew Tembo came closest to pulling one back for Zambia but his flying header midway through the second half was just wide. Williams ended the home fans' anxiety with a close-in shot that hit the post before going in for South Africa's third.

GCAT	Hungary's success-starved football fans have received a surprise Christmas present courtesy of the BBC and the English Football Association. Forty-three years after their football team defeated England 6-3 at Wembley stadium in what has been called "The game of the century," Hungarian fans will at last have a chance to see the whole game on television after the BBC donated a cassette of the full 90 minutes to the cash-strapped Hungarian State Television (MTV). The game, in November 1953, was the first time that England had been beaten at Wembley and introduced the world to stars such as Ferenc Puskas and Nandor Hidegkuti. Yet, ironically, the Hungarians never saw their greatest moment. At the time there was no television in Hungary and fans had to rely on radio for information on the action. A few days after the game 20 minute highlights were shown in cinema's across the country. "The game made Hungarian football famous all over the world and now we will have a chance to see it all for ourselves,"said Jeno Knezy, Head of Sport Department at MTV. The programme will be shown on Christmas Day and is expected to attract a massive audience. "The interest is enormous," Knezy said, adding that Hungarian TV would have been unable to purchasee the rights for the game. The rights were held by the English Football Association whoe waived the rights fee. "This is a wonderful human gesture, so rare in today's world," he told Reuters. The idea for the donation came from Britain's Ambassador to Hungary, Christopher Long. "We wanted to evoke a heroic moment in British-Hungarian sporting history. The fact that it has never been shown before, gives a special resonance here," he said. Hungarian fans have had little to cheer of late, as their national team have failed to qualify for any major international tournament in over a decade. But the film will recall happy memories fopr many fans such as Robert Szenci, a 74-year old Honved fan. "I was at college on the day of the game," he said. "The teacher stopped the class and switched on the radio - we all listened to the game together. I will be watching the game, along with 80 percent of my generation." "It will remind us of the good old days, but the younger fans will be able to see just how good we were," Szenci said.

GCAT	A Spanish High Court judge has asked the United States to hand over all its intelligence files on Argentina's 1976-83 military dictatorship, court documents published on Wednesday said. Judge Baltasar Garzon, who is investigating the disappearance of Spaniards during Argentina's dictatorship, requested papers via an international commission from the CIA, the FBI, the Pentagon and U.S. embassies in Latin America. In the February 28 court order, Garzon said he was seeking all data available on: "The start of the military repression and the paramilitary forces in Argentina that had as a consequence the death and disappearance of 330 Spanish citizens and Spanish descendants residing in that country". The judge, who has called on 101 members of the Argentine armed forces to give evidence about the "dirty war" in which thousands disappeared without a trace, reiterated that request and asked Spain to take measures to ensure they appear. Garzon said Argentine authorities had violated a treaty with Spain on judicial cooperation that the two countries had ratified in 1990 and the South American country had a "legal obligation" to comply with his court's requests. "They have decided that a blanket of ominous silence will cover up what happened forever," Garzon said in another court document. "It's a cruel reality."
GCAT	Zaire will announce its team for talks with Laurent Kabila's rebels in the coming days, state radio reported on Monday. The radio gave no precise date for the talks but referred to "talk of a possible first meeting" in South Africa before the end of the week. Rebel spokesman in the east have said the talks could be as early as Thursday. "There is talk of a possible first meeting between the representatives of the rebellion and those from Kinshasa towards the end of the week in South Africa," the radio said. "In Kinshasa we should know within the coming days the names of the personalities who will make up the committee of negotiators," it added. The rebels took up arms in October, vowing to topple veteran President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has dominated the sprawling Central African nation since seizing power in 1965. Mobutu has asked parliament to appoint a seven-member negotiating team representing government, the judiciary, the opposition, his own presidential movement and with a special representative from the presidency to take charge of the talks.
CCAT	Grow Biz International Inc said Friday it backs the second-quarter earnings consensus of $0.16 a share. "We're comfortable with those numbers," Ronald Olson, president and chief executive officer of the used merchandise retail chain, said in an interview.   The projected results for the second quarter are more than double the $0.07 a share Grow Biz reported a year ago. Olson said he backed the 1997 earnings estimate range of $0.65 to $0.67 a share, up from $0.40 a year ago. "We're comfortable with that," he added. Revenues for the second quarter, however, will be "a little bit flat," Olson said, due to Grow Biz's elimination of its corporate buying group that helped franchisees finance the purchase of merchandise. The buying group had been a low-margin operation, he added. Grow Biz's retail divisions include Play It Again Sports, selling used sporting goods; Once Upon A Child, children's merchandise; Computer Renaissance, computers; Disc Go Round, compact disks, and Music Go Round, musical instruments. Grow Biz recently agreed to buy Video Game Exchange, a 40-store chain that handles used video games and equipment. ((Reuters Chicago Newsdesk (312) 408-8787))
MCAT	Taiwan's share index blistered to within 115 points of 10,000 and a seven-year intraday high on Thursday, but lost momentum in the final minutes to salvage only a modest closing gain on all-time record turnover. The electronics sector, which led the early charge on steam from Wall Street's high-tech rally, nosedived in late trade as investors took profits and shifted to other major sectors. The benchmark index throttled technical resistance at 9,600 to notch a sizzling seven-year intraday high 9,889.45, but ended with a gain of just 27.24 points or 0.29 percent at 9,571.8. Turnover screamed to a historic high T$296.8 billion.
MCAT	British stocks will be hoping to catch their breath in the coming week after surprise anti-inflation comments from Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan sent a tremor through world markets on Friday. Yet in a week packed with inflation indicators on both sides of the Atlantic, markets seem likely to remain in a jittery mood, worried about the outlook for interest rates and inflation through 1997. And in the UK, the unstable political situation could also unsettle the markets, with Prime Minister John Major obliged on Friday to declare his full support for finance minister Kenneth Clarke after reports of policy disagreements between the two. Markets are anyway likely to remain on edge in the run-up to the key December 17 meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's key policy-making Open Markets Committee (FOMC). "The weekend press will be filled with speculation about splits, that the Tories will dump Clarke," said Andy Hartwill, strategist at brokerage SocGen, "and the markets will be volatile at least until the December 17 FOMC meeting." On Friday Conservative party legislator John Gorst said he was leaving the ruling parliamentary party, wiping out the government's majority of one. Some traders said the Friday fall-out was no more than a bout of profit-taking on the strong gains seen this year in equities on both sides of the Atlantic. Friday's lower-than-expected U.S. employment report also helped calm fears that economic growth is poised to revive, boosting hopes that inflation is unlikely to become a problem anytime soon. Yet others pointed out that Greenspan's comments about the "irrational exuberance" of markets seemed to have been aimed specifically at capping the rip-roaring market gains seen this year. "With my hand on my heart I could not say I would be a buyer at these levels," said trader in UK stocks. "There is no point in being a hero in these markets." UK economic reports this week include producer prices for November on Monday and retail prices on Thursday. In the U.S., producer prices, consumer prices and retail sales reports are also released during the week. In a sparse week for UK company results, groups reporting include Chubb Security Plc, British Land Plc, London Electricity Plc and Greenall Plc. The FTSE 100 index of blue chip stocks on Friday tumbled more than 150 points at one stage, before rallying towards the close as Wall Street steadied after an expected early tumble. The FTSE's decline took the index at one stage to its lowest level since September 6. The index set a record intraday level of 4,094.4 on November 26.
CCAT	Dutch bank ABN AMRO Holding NV said on Thursday it planned a listing of its shares in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) on the New York Stock Exchange. It said it would buy back one percent of its own shares for this purpose which would be reoffered to to U.S. investors. ABN AMRO said it also planned a four-for-one split of its ordinary shares.   "The managing board has decided...to propose to the general meeting of shareholders a split of the ordinary shares of NLG 5 face value into four ordinary shares of NLG 1.25 face value," ABN AMRO said in a statement accompanying its 1996 results. "ABN AMRO intends to list its ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of American Depositary Receipts," it said. "In connection with the NYSE listing, ABN AMRO will purchase approximately one percent of the ordinary shares outstanding from one or more parties for re-offer to U.S. investors." The share split and NYSE listing are expected to take effect in May, it added. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
CCAT	Italian tyre and cables group Pirelli said in a statement it had signed an agreement today with Hong Kong-based CITIC Pacific for the establishment of a cables joint venture in China.   The joint venture, to be called Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd, will manufacture telecommunication cables including fibre optic cables using Pirelli technology in a factory located in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, near Shanghai. The Wuxi plant will make both copper cables and optic fibre telecommunication cables with turnover expected to reach $60 million within the next few years. The move marks Pirelli's first industrial site in China in a market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000, doubling demand for optical cables.   "The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value, representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia," said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera in a statement. The Wuxi plant will see a total global investment of $30 million by both partners over the few years. Pirelli Cables has global sales of over $3.5 billion, and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the U.S., Europe and the Far East. CITIC Pacific is a major Hong Kong-listed company focusing on infrastruture, trading, distribution and property, with 28 percent of its profits in 1995 coming from the telecoms sector. The group has investments in several industrial joint ventures in China and investments in two Hong Kong-based airlines -- a 25 percent stake in Cathay Pacific and 28.5 percent share in Dragonair. -- Milan newsroom +392 66120502
CCAT	British liquor company Allied Domecq Plc said Tuesday it was studying whether the planned $15.8 billion merger between rivals Grand Metropolitan Plc and Guinness Plc will give them an unfair dominance in any of Allied's markets. "We have set up a task force to look at the issue," Allied Chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said in an interview. Hogg, however, was optimistic about the prospects for his company after the merger, which was announced on Monday and would be the biggest ever in Britain. "I think we are in a very good position following yesterday's merger, we have 12 of the top 100 brands, we are in increasingly good shape in wines and spirits and we can seize oppurtunities open to us which will be greatly increased by the merger," he said. Allied shares rose 19.5 pence (31.8 cents) to 466 pence ($7.60) as investors took a view that the group was now more vulnerable to a takeover in the wake of its rivals' merger. Some investors believe the merger leaves Allied looking weak and in need of strategic partners if it is to stop its market share from being eroded. Hogg said it was too early to say whether Allied would complain to monopoly authorities about the planned merger. "There is so much to be examined and analysed." "We have to look at it on a market by market, territory by territory basis. But we have a duty to complain if it's in shareholders interests," he said. Allied also said pretax profits were little change at 317 million pounds ($515 million), with profits from its spirits and wine division off 2 percent. The proposed Guinness-Grand Met merger would create the world's seventh largest branded food and drinks company, GMG Brands. It will be the leading spirits and wine group with combined annual sales of more than 100 million cases. The deal is subject to European Union and U.S. regulatory approval. Top officials at Guinness and Grand Met said on Monday they did not expect opposition from regulators although Canadian-based Seagram Co. Ltd., the world's second largest spirits company, called the deal anti-competitive.
CCAT	Telecommunications giant AT&T Corp. and software superpower Microsoft Corp. teamed up Thursday to package each other's Internet products, giving Microsoft a leg up in its Web browser battle with Netscape Communications Corp. Personal computer users who have Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system will get the Redmond, Wash., company's Internet Explorer 3.0 when they sign up for AT&T's Internet access service, AT&T WorldNet Service, the companies said. AT&T said it designated Internet Explorer 3.0, the latest version of Microsoft's software for accessing the Web, as the default browser for WorldNet. Before Thursday, AT&T had offered Netscape Navigator as the sole browser software for WorldNet. AT&T will still offer Navigator, but customers will have to specify it when ordering the Internet service. The move was seen as yet another blow to Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape, which has asked the Justice Department to investigate Microsoft's Internet marketing tactics and whether they violate the software giant's 1994 consent decree with the department. Netscape stock dropped $3 to $45 on the Nasdaq. Asked if Microsoft had any qualms about announcing yet another deal with an online access provider in light of yet another Justice Department probe, a company vice president, Brad Chase, said he did not know any details of the investigation. "To my knowledge that is not what they are investigating at all, and I don't know any of the details at all," Chase said in a conference call with reporters. "It's sad that our competitors are seeking government intervention ... We are very proud of the progress we have made." Chase, a general manager in Microsoft's Internet division, pointed out that Internet Explorer's market share has doubled since the company unveiled Version 3.0 six weeks ago, jumping from 5-10 percent of the market, to 10-20 percent. "We are very excited about the continued momentum in the downloads (of the software from Web sites) we have had," Chase said. "We are pretty pumped up." He hinted at more deals with other online services and Internet access services but declined to be specific. "We do have a relationship with other access providers, but I don't want to make any announcements today," Chase said. Industry sources said the Prodigy Services Co. online service is expected to announce a similar deal next week. A Prodigy spokesman at the service's headquarters in White Plains, N.Y., declined to comment. As part of its deal with AT&T, Microsoft will offer WorldNet software bundled with Windows 95, and WorldNet will appear as an icon in the software's online services folder when users start up their new PCs. Most computers with Windows 95 delivered during the upcoming holiday season were expected to include WorldNet. AT&T stands to benefit from that part of the deal. Although the New York-based company has long been a major power in long-distance phone and other telecommunications, it is relatively new in the Net access business and, with 425,000 WorldNet subscribers, lags behind big online services like America Online Inc. with 6.2 million. AT&T WorldNet Vice President Tom Evslin said his company selected Internet Explorer as its primary Web browser instead of Netscape because of requests from its customers following many positive reviews. "We are giving customers a choice," Evslin said. He said AT&T was also impressed by Microsoft's promise to give customers free upgrades of its browser software "forever." Microsoft said it expected shortly to begin beta, or final customer testing, of versions of Internet Explorer 3.0 for the Macintosh and Windows 3.1 operating systems. Some analysts pointed out that even as Microsoft makes inroads in the browser market, Netscape still retains a dominant, growing stake in the arena for Internet server software, which functions as printing press and warehouse for Web pages. "Microsoft has been pretty aggressive about going after every partner Netscape has," said Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst at MecklerMedia Internet Consulting. But he pointed out that the browser, or client, software is just the front door to the server software -- which is generating revenues. "Netscape is the leader in server software," Harmon said. "While the client wanes, the server market is going strong."
ECAT	German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said on Friday the latest report by the "wise men" panel of independent economic advisors vindicated government efforts to push through reforms. "The study shows the economic policies of the government are the only viable way towards the sustained improvement of growth and employment in Germany," Rexrodt said in a statement. "It refutes repeated claims that the government's growth and jobs plan is an attack on the welfare state," he added. In its report, the five-man panel said the economy would grow 2.5 percent next year after 1.5 percent in 1996, and, although inflation will remain low at 1.75 percent, German unemployment will remain stuck at over four million. It added that Germany will miss its goal of qualifying for European monetary union, because its budget deficit will fall in 1997 only to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product from an expected 4.2 percent this year. Finance Minister Theo Waigel, whose budget cleared the parliamentary committee stage on Thursday, wants to get the deficit below the Maastricht treaty ceiling of three percent. Rexrodt said that the panel supported decisive efforts to cut the budget deficit, reduce taxes and cut state spending as a proportion of total economic output. Although the consolidation will temporarily dampen demand in the economy, the risks of taking no action are greater, Rexrodt said, agreeing with the panel's conclusions. Waigel is trying to negotiate a stability pact with other European states to ensure fiscal discipline under the single currency, and Rexrodt said a similar deal between the German federal government, states and local governments was needed. -- Douglas Busvine, Bonn newsroom, 49-228-26097150
GCAT	A high-ranking team of U.S. law enforcement experts has arrived in Sarajevo to aid the Bosnian government's fight against organised crime and to help ensure security for next month's national elections. "We are concerned about organised crime in Bosnia, as are Bosnian officials, and especially about narcotics trafficking," the team leader, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard, told reporters on Friday. "Eastern Europe is being swamped by a tidal wave of drugs which originate with the opium and heroin trade from Afghanistan. The old Balkan route is opening up again with connections to Turkey, Italy, many countries." Gelbard met with officials from the country's Moslem-Croat federation and from its Serb republic during the week, emphasising the need for law enforcement cooperation both within Bosnia and between Bosnia and its European neighbours. Describing drugs and organised crime as "trans-national" problems, Gelbard said post-war Bosnia needs help in restoring its entire criminal justice system, from local police all the way through the ranks of the judiciary. "Bosnian officials admit that their pre-war organised crime-fighting capability has been lost," the envoy said. "They have to develop an institutional capability to combat crime and narcotics, they have to realise that these are threats against the security of their government." Warlords carved up much of Bosnia during 43-months of war, dealing stolen automobiles, guns, drugs, food, fuel and human beings across front lines for enormous profit. Even in peace some of those same individuals and their organisations remain active. The counterfeiting of money and identity documents is a growing problem in Bosnia as well. Gelbard said the United States is prepared to provide training and technical assistance to Bosnia. More funds could come from a law enforcement donor's conference for Bosnia scheduled to be held in Dublin on September 28. As for security for September 14 elections, the envoy said he was satisfied that NATO-led combat troops, U.N. and local police were developing "reasonable" plans to deal with potential violence on election day. Authorities are concerned about potentially significant movements of voters across de facto ethnic boundary lines as they attempt to cast ballots in towns from which they fled or were expelled during the 43-month Bosnian war. NATO troops and U.N. police flooded the tense Bosnian city of Mostar during recent municipal elections there and prevented violence. Gelbard said the same approach might be used to calm likely flashpoints in the national elections. The Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe, which is supervising elections, has also considered erecting polling stations on either side of tense ethnic boundary lines so people could vote in the place where they are registered without crossing.
CCAT	Invacare Corp. on Tuesday refused to drop its hostile $200 million bid for Healthdyne Technologies Inc., rejecting conditions set by the medical device company for potential friendly negotiations. Invacare Chief Executive Malachi Mixon said the Elyria, Ohio-based company will pursue its attempt to oust Healthdyne Technologies' board of directors at the company's annual meeting on July 30. "These conditions are too onerous to accept. Under these conditions, we will stay exactly where we are," Mixon said in a telephone interview. Healthdyne Technologies has repeatedly rejected Invacare's offer. Invacare initially launched a bid in January and has raised it three times to the current offer of $15 per share. On Monday, Healthdyne said it would talk with interested parties about a potential transaction, but set strict conditions for possible talks with Invacare, including a demand that it withdraw its hostile bid before receiving access to confidential financial information. Although several companies have been speculated as potential "white knights" for Healthdyne Technologies, none of them apparently have come forward yet. Mixon said he had not formally notified Healthdyne Technologies about the decision, but intends to do so soon. Healthdyne Technologies stock gained 12.5 cents to $17 on Nasdaq. Invacare shares slipped 37.5 cents to $23.50, also on Nasdaq.
CCAT	German diversified industrial group Veba AG will see internal financing clearly climb in the years ahead despite higher investment, chief financial officer Hans Michael Gaul said late on Thursday. Gaul said higher internal financing would help improve the company's financial flexibility, allowing it to take advantage of strategic options. Group chairman Ulrich Hartmann said at the same event that Veba's return on equity capital would improve in 1996. "We will make another step this year toward our goal of 15 percent return on equity capital after taxes," he said. Last year, the return equity return was 11.4 percent. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
CCAT	Galileo Technology Ltd filed Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to register a public offering of up to 2.75 million ordinary shares. The Karmiel, Israel-based semiconductor manufacturer says it expects the shares to sell between $10 and $12 each. Underwriters for the offering, Alex Brown & Sons Inc, Montgomery Securities and Robertson, Stephens & Co, have an over-allotment option of up to 412,500 shares. Proceeds from the sale, an estimated $26.833 million, will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs. After the offering, the company will have 19,390,967 shares outstanding. For the three months ended March 31, the company reported net income of $485,000. That compares to a net loss of $414,000 reported in the year-earlier period.
MCAT	Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 offer prices ended mixed in late dull trading on Tuesday and sentiment remained weak due to a lack of buyers, traders said. "Prices have improved a bit after deals were done today in Palembang and Medan. But in general, sentiment remains weak because not many buyers coming to the market," said one trader. Traders said deals were quoted at 53.50 U.S. cents/lb in Medan while in Palembang, offer prices rose to 53.625, up from 53.25-53.50 in the morning. They said Surabaya followed the rise in Medan and levels were quoted there at 53.50, up 0.25 cents from the morning.   In Padang, SIR20 was firmer at 53.25, up from 53.00 in the morning, but levels were unchanged at 53.00 in Pontianak and Jambi, traders said. Some traders said offers were still heard at 54.00 U.S. cents/lb fob Medan and Padang because supply was a little bit tight. "We heard some traders offer SIR20 at 54.00, but I think it's not going to work because buyers are still reluctant to buy even if we offer rubber at 53.00 U.S. cents/lb," said one trader. Traders said some dealers still took a wait-and-see stance to see an improvement in offer prices.   "But I don't know if they can stand not to sell for a long period when prices continue to decline. They have to sell because they need cash," said another trader. Traders said the sluggish demand might be caused by the fact that many buyers already had enough stock. Some said buyers turned to Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam for cheaper prices. Some traders said they believed tight supply and the current wintering would force offer prices to decline further. -- Lewa Pardomuan, Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
MCAT	U.S. trading house Bayoil are seeking Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) to take Iraqi crude oil from the port of Mina al-Bakr around the middle of August in anticipation of the expected resumption of Iraqi oil exports under a U.N. oil-for-food deal, shipbrokers said. "The last we heard was that Bayoil was looking for something, one or two ships, for around mid-August," one broker said. "As far as I know, they are negotiating at the moment but they have not agreed anything yet." He said one potential candidate for Iraqi crude was the 270,000 deadweight tonne vessel Knock More, built in 1974, and was more likely to sail West to Europe or the United States than to the East.
CCAT	With free market aviation efforts moving ahead in Europe and Asia, U.S. negotiators are now turning their attention to Central and South America, a senior Transportation Department official said on Tuesday. Patrick Murphy, deputy assistant secretary for aviation and international affairs, said five Central American nations have already agreed to hold "open skies" talks. Dates are being arranged for March and April with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama, he said. Murphy added in an interview that negotiations with Chile to remove restrictions on U.S.-Chilean passenger and cargo services have been set for late April. The U.S. effort has turned to Latin America following successes in Europe and more recently in Asia, Murphy said, and are in keeping with the long-range American goal of breaking down aviation services restrictions worldwide. On Feb. 21, the United States reported progress in its two-year-old effort to reach an "open skies" accord with Britain, to add to the free market agreements the United States already has with Germany and 11 other European nations. The United States reached an "open skies" agreement with Singapore on Jan. 22 and is soon to hold talks with Malaysia and Taiwan. Another round of meetings with Japan is scheduled for next week in Washington, and negotiations with Malaysia are underway, Murphy said. He acknowledged that the five Central American nations were not large, but "Central America is not insignificant," noting that Costa Rica is America's 15th-largest air cargo market in the world. "We view them coming together as a group as a serious market," he said. Murphy noted also that while most of the 12 European countries that have reached "open skies" agreements with the United States were small, as a whole, almost all of Europe is now covered by free market accords. He said the "open skies" agreements being planned for Central and South American nations would allow airlines from the United States and those from the agreeing country to fly any route they wish and as frequently as they wish. In addition, he said, the free market accords grant airlines so-called "beyond rights -- permission to pick up passengers and cargo in the other country and carry them to a third country. Murphy said the cargo hub section that was part of the recent U.S.-Singapore accord was not part of standard "open skies" agreements and would not be sought in the pacts with Central and South American nations. This section gives an airline the right to operate a stand-alone cargo hub in the country, in effect making it a centre from which it could ferry freight to any place in the world. The major American carriers serving Central and South America are American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp..
CCAT	Edelman Public Relations said Wednesday it reorganized its New York office into three operating units, one of which is a new division, Edelman Financial Worldwide. The privately-owned company said it has named Carol Ruth as chairman and chief executive officer of the new division. She will be based in New York. The company said Andrew Dewar will serve as London-based president of the new division. In the other two moves at the New York office, the company said Scott Tagliarino has been named president of the corporate and public affairs unit, and Nancy Turett has been named president of consumer and healthcare unit.
MCAT	Mounting speculation about the prospect of an early parliamentary election drove French shares down sharply at Friday's opening but investors were not yielding to panic, brokers said. The market is also likely to remain volatile over the next few days as operators await to see if the parliament might be dissolved, they said. "There is some selling. But absolutely no panic. People are just being cautious due to political uncertainties," one broker said. The CAC-40 blue chip index was off 2.14 percent at 2,559.23 points at 0922 GMT, having opened down 1.19 percent. Another broker said some investors were worried the dissolution of parliament might pave the way for a new austerity plan in France ahead of the euro single currency. "There is some concern over a new austerity plan and its possible impact on economic growth," one broker said. French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said on Friday he had confidence in the government's growth, public deficit and social security deficits forecasts. "I'd like to say to you, and repeat to you, that public spending is under control and the government will meet the 3 percent target... and 2.8 percent in 1998," Arthuis said at a news conference. One share dealer said that French and foreign fund managers were hedging their bets ahead of what could be a "very hot" weekend. "Everyone is very calm. There seems to be a consensus at this stage that there will be a dissolution of parliament. But there are still questions about the timing of the announcement," one dealer said. He also said there was talk an announcement could be made this weekend. There has been so far no clear cut denial of the rumours President Jacques Chirac could announce either a reshuffle or an early election, possibly next week. The only official comment from Chirac's office so far simply said the rumours were "without" foundation although the presidential source added "The president has time on his hands for reflection."
CCAT	Esso Petroleum's Pricewatch campaign cut into its 1996 retail earnings but the giant oil company remains committed to its year-old programme that rattled the domestic gasoline market and squeezed margins, an Esso retailing official said. Esso's market share returned toward its historical levels after matching -- but not undercutting -- its lowest priced competitors last year, keeping U.K. pump prices amongst the lowest in Europe, Mark Cash, retail planning and economics manager, told Reuters in an interview. "Our 1996 retail earnings will be down versus 1995 because I think everyone recognises that margins were tighter," Cash said, without giving 1995 figures nor commenting on expectations for this year's earnings. Wood Mackenzie consultants estimated in 1996 it cost  Esso 200 million sterling ($334.4 million), or about one-third of Esso U.K.'s pre-tax profits in 1995. That takes into account the drop in gross margins and a boost in Esso's market share to 20 percent from 17 percent. "We never instigated undercutting of prices. We've only matched prices in the market, and, yes, we will continue to do that," he said. "We have no plans to change Pricewatch. It's a long-term strategic marketing change we made in 1996 and we plan to stay with it." Esso, a subsidiary of U.S. oil major Exxon Corp, pledged to monitor supermarket prices within three miles and other stations within one mile of its sites nationwide, and normally match the lowest price. Cash said 75 percent of the U.K. population lives within two miles of one of its more than 2,000 service stations, making it the retail market leader. An estimated one million more motorists a week, based on figures in July, were filling up at Esso stations in 1996 than in 1995, Cash said, describing Pricewatch as "very successful" last year. That confirmed its research that most consumers were primarily interested low prices and not necessarily promotions. He said that "...unless we respond to what the consumers want, we cannot survive long term and neither can our competitors survive long term." "Yes, we have gained market share," he added, without elaborating. But Esso, in a press release at the launch of Pricewatch, said it served 34,000 customers per hour, 365 days a year, and then later in 1996 said that 40,000 customers stopped at its filling stations every hour. The ensuing price war shaved gross fuel margins for the industry to as low as two pence per litre last summer by some accounts, sparking industry estimates that up to 2,000 filling stations could close in 1996. It also prompted a Parliamentary inquiry into whether consumers were enjoying "unrealistically low prices" that would quicken site closures, reduce competition and eventually lead to higher pump prices. The Trade and Industry Committee is expected to comment this month on a hearing in December where the government and the Office of Fair Trading were criticised for ignoring its recommendations issued last summer. Many industry analysts, however, have argued the domestic market is rife with overcapacity -- the U.K. is a traditional exporter of gasoline -- that meant a war of attrition was inevitable. Cash said Esso agreed with two of the committee's conclusions, that the retail market remains highly competitive and that government intervention was not necessary. "There are very low barriers to entry and therefore it remains a highly competitive market," he said. "There have always been site closings and it has been an unfortunate fact of life," he said.

ECAT	Vietnam's National Assembly has adopted a trade law designed to prepare the communist country for membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), official media reports said on Thursday. Vietnam News Agency said the legislation, along with two new laws on corporate tax and value added tax, would help the business community's regional and international integration. The law, Vietnam's first on trade, will come into effect on January 1, 1998. Vietnam initiated the formal process for entry into the WTO in early 1995, soon after the organisation was set up to replace the Generalised Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The government has vowed to liberalise its trade regime as part of a drive to reform the economy along market lines. It has set up an office to work on meeting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' Free Trade Area (AFTA) goal of reducing tariffs on thousands of goods to between zero and five percent. The target date for AFTA to come into effect is 2003, but Vietnam has been granted a special three-year grace period to become full integrated. Although the new legislation enshrines the right of equality before the law, it also maintains advantages for Vietnamese entities bidding for contracts. The daily Vietnam News said the draft committee agreed that if foreign bidders for a tender made equal bids and had equal qualifications, those that sub-contracted Vietnamese companies would be awarded the contract. "However, Vietnamese bidders should be given first priority in winning the bid if both foreign and Vietnamese bidders have the same qualifications," it said. Separately, a finance ministry official said new regulations were being drafted to stamp out rampant smuggling of consumer goods such as bicycles, alcohol, televisions and video recorders. He said that if the regulations were approved, certain consumer items would be deemed illegally imported if they did not carry a special customs stamp.
MCAT	* Shares close down with European markets softer on jitters over French elections next Sunday and with general nervousness generating profit-taking, brokers said. Eyes on Nokia in U.S. after quiet day. Small caps Larox and Raute gain on big orders. ------------------------ (May 28) ---------------------------- Shares ended lower on Wednesday, reflecting weakness in European markets fraught with nerves over the political situation in France and with general jitters triggering profit-taking at home, brokers said. The FOX stock futures index closed down 0.76 percent at 1,062.54 points, while the less-watched all-share HEX fell 0.89 percent to 3,066.34. Fair volume topped half a billion markka. Nokia led the decline, ending 5.40 markka lower at 346.00, with brokers looking to the bourse bellwether's Wall Street performance for direction on Thursday. Nokia accounted for almost 40 percent of total turnover.   After a buoyant offering Rauma followed the weak trend, falling 1.40 markka to 121.00 in hefty 58 million markka trade, making it the session's second-most traded share. Forestries underperformed the market, with the subindex dropping 0.94 percent, with the falls in UPM-Kymmene at 1.20 markka to 119.00, Enso 0.50 to 47.50 and Metsa-Serla 1.00 to 40.50. Small cap Larox rose 3.50 markka to 61.50, or more than six percent, after announcing orders worth 70 million markka from mining customers. Big orders also helped Raute up 3.00 markka to 52.00, brokers said.
ECAT	South Africa's top economic officials said on Wednesday they were confident that the easing of exchange controls on individuals from July 1 would not create any undue problems. Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said the move would not disrupt interest rate policy. His deputy, James Cross, estimated that between three and five billion rand could leave the country following the latest relaxation of capital controls, but this would be roughly matched by inflows. Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said the 200,000 rand limit for individual investments, announced earlier, was a one-off allowance, but he expected the cap to be increased over time.   "The chances are good that you will see little, if any, decline in foreign reserves. The level of interest rates should not be affected by this," Stals said at a news conference.   The central bank governor said local liquidity constraints would limit the amount of money which individual South Africans would take offshore.   Stals said the Reserve bank had access to 38 billion rand in official reserves and credit lines which could be used to supply liquidity to the market in the event of a significant flight of capital.   Stals said that relaxing controls for emigrants, possibly by issuing bonds to free their cash gradually, was not an immediate priority. "It is a theoretical possibility but it is not seriously considered at this stage," he said. Some 10-15 billion rand of so-called "blocked rands" belonging to emigrants are currently locked up in South Africa. Given that the owners of the money have moved abroad, all this money could be expected to leave the country once controls on it are freed. Manuel added he was not in a position to announce an amnesty for those South Africans who had illegally taken their money offshore in contravention of exchange controls. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003
CCAT	Vietnamese wheat and wheat flour consumption is expected to reach 500,000 tonnes by 2000 from around 400,000 tonnes in 1997, the deputy director-general of the Vietnam Southern Food Corporation said on Friday. Cao Thi Ngoc Hoa told a wheat conference in Singapore that demand for wheat and wheat flour had risen steadily from 100,000 tonnes in 1980 to 320,000 tonnes in 1995. "We expect it will be 500,000 tonnes for the year 2000. We need to import all the wheat from other countries," she said.   Some 150,000 tonnes of wheat is imported annually, mainly from Australia. The rest is wheat flour and comes from France, India and China, Cao said. About 60 percent of all imports is used for noodles and the rest is for items like cakes and bread. Cao said three flour mills were being constructed in Vietnam and should be completed in three years. -- Singapore Newsroom (65-8703305)
MCAT	U.S. Treasuries traded in London kept a grip on gains made in the U.S. session, but recent shock moves have left investors exhausted and unwilling to enter into major positions, traders said on Friday. This cautious approach, combined with a holiday in much of Europe to mark Assumption Day, has left the market high and dry. "There are hardly any flows to report," said a trader at a U.S. bank in London. "The market has been so choppy, and sold off so violently a couple of times recently that people are reluctant to get long." U.S. 30-year long bond at 97-24, yielding 6.54 percent compared with 97-22 in Tokyo and 97-23 at the New York close. Traders said the underlying sentiment is still healthy, as the latest data releases have confirmed expectations that inflation is under control -- and there's little sign that it will be an imminent concern. "I'd still be a better buyer of dips," said the trader. "The selling has been done." But in the short term, with the good news already priced in, traders said there is limited potential for Treasuries to break out of their range. The September futures contract was likely to remain in a range from 114-08 to 113-12. They were trading up 1/32 at 113-21 in automated trade. There was little data on the menu. The preliminary Michigan Survey for August due at 1400 GMT was forecast to give a reading of 107.2, up slightly from 107.1 previously. December Eurodollar futures were up 0.10 at 94.105 by 1040 GMT. -- Lisa Wilson. International Bonds Unit + 44 171 542 6137

ECAT	Israel and Mexico have agreed to begin negotiations on a free-trade agreement, an Israeli official said on Tuesday. The idea was raised during a meeting on Monday between Israeli Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and visiting Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria. "The two sides agreed that there is joint interest in signing a free trade agreement," said the industry and trade ministry spokesman in a statement. "The (Mexican) foreign minister proposed launching contacts on the issue of a free trade zone immediately," he said. Sharansky said such an agreement would enhance trade relations between the two countries and would round out Israel's commercial ties with North America. Israel already has FTA agreements with the United States and Canada. Mexico trades freely with the two countries under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Israeli exports to Mexico reached $52 million last year mainly in chemical products, electrical and mechanical machinery, medical and optic supplies and plastics and rubber goods. The Jewish state imported $8.7 million in goods from Mexico in 1996 including textiles, agricultural products and foodstuffs. - Tel Aviv newsroom 972-3-5372211
MCAT	As the economic and political scenes bask in the glow of Bill Clinton's second electoral honeymoon, the Dow Jones Industrials could reach the 6400 level between this week and year-end. "There will be a short honeymoon period without much sniping at the president. It would look pretty tacky for the Republicans if they said their first order of business was to get Clinton, especially before he is sworn in," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment officer at Fahnestock & Co.   A busy calendar of economic data arrives this week against the backdrop of a highly valued stock market and a long bond yield down at the 6.50 percent level. "This week is packed full of important releases that will determine whether the long bond yield goes below 6.50 percent," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "If it does, it will set off another strong move on the stock market."   Data include the October producer and consumer price indices, due on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, October retail sales on Thursday and October industrial production and capacity utilization due on Friday. "The numbers are likely to send a mixed signal. The core consumer inflation number could come in stronger than expected. Industrial production and capacity utilization may not be as weak as expected." Still, many analysts expect the market to put in a solid performance for the remainder of the year with nothing short of a major event stopping its upward momentum.   "My suspicion is that the rally phase is not complete and that there will be an extension of the current rally before a more significant time-out," said Barthel. "There will be a short pause, but not before we get closer to the 6400 level on the Dow. If the data this week are favorable, you will see stocks rally to 6400 by the end of the year," Barthel said. "If not, we may take a pause and rally later. The trend is up." He said that the various legal woes still ahead for President Clinton are not likely to kick in and start making trouble until after he is sworn in next January.   Not all forecasts are rosy, however. Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co, said that 1997 could see deterioration in earnings. "I think we are facing something of a margin squeeze," Metz said. "The bull story has been the expansion of profit margins, which resulted in earnings growth, which was much more rapid than the overall economy over the next few years." He said that the factors behind expanding profit margins such as downsizing, improving productivity and a weak dollar, were no longer in place.   "Any industry competing with imported products will be hit by a stronger dollar," he said. "The market will suffer from anemic money flows, disappointments in profit margins and a little fear of inflation because of rising commodity prices and wage costs at a time when valuations are absolutely obscenely high," Metz said.
ECAT	Polish consumer confidence indicators, measured by the Demoskop polling institute for the Rzeczpospolita daily, were mixed in May after rising in April, Demoskop said on Tuesday. Demoskop's economic climate index hit an all time high of 108 points, up from 104 points in April, but propensity to spend fell to 99 points from 103 in the previous month. The consumer optimism index edged down to 103 points from a April's all time high of 104 points.

CCAT	South African printing and publishing business Penrose Ltd topped the list of volume traders on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange early on Wednesday after 10.0 million shares were bought from offshore. Dealers said that the shares had traded after hours in a single tranche at 150 cents each. They said the deal, which saw the shares being bought from an offshore seller, had been carried out by brokerage Smith Borkum Hare. Smith Borkum declined to comment.   Penrose, which last year went into liquidation before being bought out by fellow publishing group CTP Holdings, returned to profitability in the 15 months to end-March reporting share earnings of 3.1 cents compared with a 55.3 cents loss per share in the year to December 1995. The firm's listing was reinstated on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in April after a period of suspension. Penrose recently bought a number of regional newspaper publishing businesses for over 75 million rand. -- Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003

CCAT	A proposal calling for an independent board of directors at Archer Daniels Midland Co has garnered a significant number of votes, the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) said. A survey of votes cast thus far indicated that 47 percent are in favor of the proposal, which is co-sponsored by CalPERS and the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund, said Brad Pacheco, a CalPERS spokesman. He cautioned that a significant number of shares have not yet been voted in advance of ADM's October 17 annual meeting.   "We see some people sitting on the fence," Pacheco said. CalPERS also said it withheld its estimated 3.5 million shares from election of the ADM director nominees. CalPERS said its proposal gained support after ADM pleaded guilty to two counts of price fixing and agreed to pay $100 million in fines. "There is no more important time than now, nor greater need to send the strongest possible signal for meaningful change in ADM's governance," James Burton, CalPERS chief executive officer, said in a statement. "Quite simply, an independent board is the best way to prevent corporate criminal activity, so that this company will never again have to squander shareholders money to pay criminal fines," he added. The measure calling for an independent board, consisting of members with no personal or business ties to ADM, is one of three proposals offered by institutional shareholders. Other measures call for confidential voting for board members when there is no competing proxy and the establishment of personal financial liability for directors in cases of gross negligence.

MCAT	The Australian All Resources share index (Wednesday close 1,361.7) has continued to trade lower, but has bounced from a double-bottom. Traders expect more of the same within established bands which are currently 1,365 to 1,415. Short term technical indicators continue to be bearish. With the index less than 10 points from last week the moving averages are bunched around the index level. Traders are likely to wait for a clearer signal before moving either way. Leading indicators are all moving lower, but could become oversold soon. All Fibonacci levels have been reached on the move lower. With the double bottom bounce, traders have focused on the higher final target at 1,389. In the medium term the index is back within the band 1,365 to 1,415. Traders are likely to continue to trade the ranges and the break. The overall larger bull market also has support at 1,300. Medium term technicals are mixed. Recent consolidation has bunched the averages around the index. The ROC is moving lower, the RSI is sidelined, and the Stochastic while trending higher is lower than last week. These indicators are not inspiring to either bulls or bears. In the longer term, the index still looks bullish, but must move higher and remain above 1,400 to keep the bulls happy. Longer term technicals are mixed to bearish. Traders are most likely to trade the breaks. The index continues to range-trade. Technicals are on balance bearish. Traders will continue using the established ranges and major levels to adjust and set new positons. Support is at 1,330, 1,350 and 1,365, with resiatance at 1,415 and 1,455.

ECAT	South Africa has no plans to expand significantly its foreign debt portfolio, finance department director-general Maria Ramos said on Tuesday. "At the moment only 4.2 percent of our portfolio is in anything but rands and we will be managing it next year to keep it at around those ratios," she told reporters. "It may be marginally up, it may be marginally down, we don't have any plans to expand our foreign debt portfolio in any massive way."   Ramos said the government had no need to raise more funds offshore. "We actually don't need to because we can finance the entire deficit domestically. We have done these issues for reasons of other strategies, benchmarking, extending the maturity of the profile of the existing debt," she said. Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said that government had now completed its plans to raise 2.5 billion rand of its borrowing requirement offshore. In September, South Africa issued a seven-year 500 million mark issue at a 140 basis points above equivalent German government issues. On October 11, the country issued a $300 million 10-year Yankee bond at 195 basis points above the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond. -- Lynda Loxton, Cape Town newsroom, +27 21 252-238
MCAT	Capital flows to the emerging markets will likely persist after the Federal Reserve left U.S. rates steady, U.S. portfolio managers said on Tuesday. Investment should continue even if the Fed does hike rates over the next few months, as is widely expected, because tightening comes at a gradual pace, investors said. "Because the world has changed and tightening liquidity is more gradual than in the past, we will probably see the (emerging) markets holding their own," said Luis R. Luis, head of emerging market analysis at Scudder Stevens & Clark.   Luis said emerging debt prices would likely tighten around 100 basis points against comparable U.S. Treasuries by the end of the year, despite expectations the Fed would soon ratchet up interest rates again. "The market is prepared to absorb a shift of 50 basis points in U.S. rates over the next six months," he said. Anthony della Piana, portfolio manager at John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, said that minor U.S. rate movements were probably irrelevant to the credit fundamentals of individual emerging market assets. "A rapid rise in rates affecting market and global liquidity would be a concern, but from my perspective there is enough market liquidity that even a 1.0 percent move in rates, would not have a major impact," della Piana said. The basis for healthy flows was improved credit conditions and the fact that Brady bonds still offered considerable yield advantage over comparable assets, investors said. Luis added that higher U.S. rates might prompt some adjustments as players marginally shift toward emerging market fixed-income instruments and away from equities. Not all investors shared the optimistic forecasts concerning the prospects foor emerging market assets. Steve Merrell, senior portfolio manager at American Express Financial Services, said he expected short- to intermediate-term spread widening as an eventual Fed hike deprives the system of liquidity. "When liquidity dries up and (investors) don't need a place to put so much of their money, there is going to be less of a demand for emerging market paper at a time when supply is increasing," Merrell said. Merrell said he had shifted his portfolio to more defensive positions, emphasizing local currency instruments and shorter-maturity dollar paper. (( -- N.A. Treasury Desk, 212-859-1660 ))
ECAT	More Poles now believe their economy is moving towards a market system, rather than towards socialism, or is at least half way there, according to a survey by Centrum Badania Opinii Spolecznej (CBOS). Three years ago, when the public CBOS institute last surveyed them on this subject, they thought differently. In a poll conducted in September 1996, nearly seven years after the fall of communism and Poland's centrally-planned system, 28 percent said the economy was changing toward a market, up from 18 percent in April 1993. @ Some 25 percent told CBOS the economy was changing toward socialism, less than the 39 percent who held this view three years ago. About a third of the 1150 people surveyed between September 12-17 said the economy was in the middle of the road between a market orientation and socialism, up from 25 percent in 1993, while 14 percent were undecided. "In society's consciousness the dominant view is that we are now crossing or have crossed the 'critical point' on the road to a market economy," CBOS said in an analysis of the poll results. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700

MCAT	Ringgit continued to accumulate losses in late Asian trading on fresh selling by funds and the strong dollar/majors, dealers said on Monday. They said many who had place dollar sell orders on Friday night were seen covering their positions as the strong dollar/majors swamped the market early on Monday. "A lot of people who had initiated shorts were buying back dollars," the head of foreign exchange dealing at a Malaysian bank said. He said there was some dollar selling by corporates and Japanese funds, but that was absorbed by the market.   A Singapore-based U.S. bank dealer said the market was unlikely to move sharply in London as players were cautious ahead of Malaysia's February trade data release on Tuesday. "Unless it is way out of expectations, the ringgit should trade in a wide range," he said. Dealers said if 2.5150 a dollar level was broken, dollar/ringgit could head for 2.5180 or even 2.52.

ECAT	The Brazilian government considers 1997 to be "decisive" in the battle to balance its books and stabilize its growing debt stockpile, said Planning Minister Antonio Kandir. Kandir reaffirmed the federal government was committed to achieving a primary budget surplus of 0.8 percent of gross domestic product and a primary surplus for the consolidated public sector accounts of 1.5 percent of GDP. "The year 1997 is truly decisive (for the government's attempts to balance its books)," Kandir told reporters after a ministerial cabinet meeting called to discuss the 1997 budget.   "The government is determined to pursue a (federal) primary surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP," the minister said. In the same briefing, presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral said state firms were expected to post a primary surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP and that the states would hopefully end the year in fiscal balance, generating a primary suplus of 1.5 percent for the consolidated public sector. In 1996, the public sector saw a small primary deficit of 0.08 percent of GDP. In operational terms, which unlike the primary result includes debt servicing costs, the public sector posted a 3.89 percent of GDP deficit.   Kandir said the cabinet had approved the bimonthly spending programme outlined in the 1997 budget and that financial discipline would help achieve the government's fiscal results. He said 85 percent of funds allocated to the ministries were guaranteed and that the remaining 15 percent would be freed up depending on the performance of tax revenue. Of 9.8 billion reais in total first half income budgeted for the ministries, 8.3 billion reais was guaranteed. In the second half, 14.5 billion had been allocated to the ministries of which 10.5 billion was guaranteed.   The rest depended on revenue and also on approval by Congress of the Fiscal Stabilization Fund (FEF), a key fiscal tool that allows the government to spend some of the budget as it sees fit. Kandir said 1.9 billion reais in budgeted revenue for the ministries depended on the FEF. "Let me state quite clearly," Kandir said. "We don't expect a shortfall in tax revenue as our estimates...are extremely conservative."

CCAT	India's largest steelmaker said on Monday it was exploring buying a stake in an Australian coal mine in what analysts said was an unusually bold foray by a state-owned firm. The state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) said it had begun talks with the British Coal Corporation to buy the British firm's 14.8 percent stake in Australia's German Creek Mine. "We are talking to them," a SAIL spokesman told Reuters by telephone. "They have given us some rather sketchy information. We have asked for more." A British Coal spokeswoman told Reuters in London: "British Coal is in the process of disposing all of its remaining interests. At the appropriate time this will include the German Creek joint venture. "But currently British Coal is not in negotiations with any organisation on the sale of its interest. However, the corporation keeps in touch with potential purchasers with a view to judging the right time to proceed with a disposal." She gave no further details. The SAIL spokesman said the preliminary talks could help SAIL enter a long-term arrangement to meet the coal needs of its steel plants. "I am not aware of any such situation or experience by other public sector companies," said Shashank Bhide of the National Council of Applied Economic Research. "But given the large size of SAIL they probably would be in a position to enter into this kind of an arrangement. If there is sufficient autonomy for companies they will do this and it makes sense," he told Reuters. Another SAIL official, who did not want to be identified, said the steelmaker needed to ensure a steady supply of good quality coal and faced sourcing problems with state-run Coal India Ltd (CIL). "We require about 15 million tonnes of coal (every year), and we get nine from CIL and the balance from Australia and New Zealand," the official said. On CIL's coal, he said: "We are having a lot of problems. Not only in pricing but also in ash content." SAIL officials say a high ash content adversely affects the efficiency of steel plants, and the company needed to look for international alternatives to improve its functioning as it had plans to emerge as a major global player. SAIL, state-run power plants and the Indian railways are among the biggest users of coal in India. India is expected to produce 300 million tonnes of coal in 1996/97 (April-March). It produced 270.45 million tonnes in 1995/96. SAIL reported a net profit of 12.22 billion rupees ($341.3 million) in 1995/96 after 11.29 billion rupees in 1994/95, producing 10.54 million tonnes of crude steel and 9.45 million tonnes of saleable steel after 10.3 million tonnes of crude steel and 9.1 million tonnes of saleable steel in 1994/95.

MCAT	The Australian dollar was a 1/3 cent firmer at the midsession although off its highs after its early short covering rally stalled at US$0.7420 resistance. The currency took off after the Reserve Bank stayed silent at its morning money market operation, confounding intense speculation it would ease policy today. Traders said those betting on a move had to reverse a few positions, but the overall market remained very short in the confident expectation the bank would ease after its board meeting on August 5. Thus while they saw room for some gains near term, they doubted it could clear the US$0.7375 barrier.   By 12.30 pm (0230 GMT) the dollar was hovering at US$0.7393/98 having climbed as high as US$0.7423 shortly after the RBA policy window came and went, but was still up on its early US$0.7361/66 and US$0.7348/53 late here Thursday. Traders said support under US$0.7330 had impressed so far and would probably hold while the market waited for the RBA to make up its mind, but if it were broken a test of the 1996 trough of US$0.7305 would not be far behind. The currency was broadly firmer on the crosses thanks largely to fund flows out of the mark and Swiss franc and into the dollar bloc in general.

A Paribas spokesman denied that it might consider a link-up with Societe Generale. "Paribas reaffirms what it said during the presentation of its results.

GCAT	As Richard Sullivan learned Wednesday, beneath the courtly manners that govern the Senate hearings into campaign finance abuses lies a process that is often ruthless. Sullivan, finance director of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) during last year's election, was grilled for four hours as the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee sought to ferret out evidence of improper fund raising. The contest pitted a man in his mid-30's against 16 senators, some of them nearly twice his age. Virtually all the senators began by politely thanking Sullivan, the first witness called before the committee, for agreeing to testify and several praised his candor. But that did not stop them from slipping in the knife later. Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican elected to the Senate 25 years ago, opened his questioning by asking solicitously, "Are you feeling alright?" "I'm fine," replied the startled witness. "I'm feeling great too," said Domenici, who then subjected Sullivan to a withering line of questions on whether a series of coffees held at the White House were fund raisers. Sullivan, like the White House, maintained that the events attended by President Bill Clinton were not fund raisers despite documents that refer to $400,000 fund-raising targets that were set and generally reached. His defence, like that of the White House, rests on the argument that there was no price tag for attendance at the coffees and that no one was ever asked for a donation at them, although they were often solicited afterwards. Domenici was having none of it. "For the first time since you've been here, I really believe you are spewing words calculated to confuse the issue," the senator snapped. Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, was equally rough as he asked Sullivan how Wang Jun, an executive with a Chinese state-controlled company whose businesses include arms manufacturing, came to attend one of the White House coffees. Wang came to the White House coffee on Feb. 6, 1996. On the same day, according to documents released by the committee, the wife of Ernest Green, an official with investment bank Lehman Brothers who was hosting Wang in Washington, wrote the DNC a $50,000 check. Sullivan said he believed the DNC had done a computer database search on Wang, a Chinese citizen, and had not turned up any information that suggested he should not attend. "The public record is clear that Wang Jun has ties at a very high level to Chinese officials and that he's the head of a major arms dealer," Specter shot back, arguing that any database search would have picked this up. Sullivan, shifting in his seat and his voice breaking slightly, replied: "It's obviously a mistake. It was something that as I understood it was important to Ernie, who had this guy in town doing business. Ernie has been a long-term supporter and it was purely as a favour to Ernie." At the end of the session, some of the senators, as well as their staff, showed some sympathy for Sullivan. "This is a highly pressured format for a fellow like that," Mike Madigan, counsel for the committee's Republican majority, told reporters after the hearing. "Mr. Sullivan is in a very difficult position ... He is at a young age and I think he is trying the best he can to answer the questions."

CCAT	Russia has dropped London-based investment bank N.M. Rothschild as adviser on the sale of a stake in telecoms holding company AO Svyazinvest, the State Property Committee said on Tuesday. "By agreement of both sides, the financial consultants -- a consortium of investment banks led by N.M. Rothschild -- have completed their work on this project," a statement from the State Property Committee, Russia's privatisation ministry, said. The statement did not say who would take over as adviser, and a committee spokesman declined to comment. The London Financial Times said on Tuesday that Russia's Alfa-Bank and Most-Bank would handle the sale in future. The Russian Privatisation Centre, a Russian state fund, had been working with Rothschild on privatising Svyazinvest. The committee, expressing thanks to the privatisation centre and to Rothschild, made clear that both institutions were no longer working on the deal. The committee said that out of a series of options for selling Svyazinvest proposed by Rothschild and by the World Bank, the government had decided to transfer its 38 percent stake in national phone company Rostelekom to Svyazinvest. "In the opinion of (the committee) and the Telecommunications Ministry, the shares of the 'renewed' Svyazinvest will be more attractive to portfolio investors on the one hand, and on the other, privatisatising them will not have a damaging effect on national security," it said. Russia originally intended to sell 25 percent of Svyazinvest, which holds large but minority state shareholdings in 85 regional telecoms companies, to a single strategic investor. Italy's state-owned telecom holding company Stet SpA won a tender last year for this stake, in what would have been Russia's biggest privatisation and inward investment to date, but the deal fell through before completion. Officials had repeatedly said they would sell the stake this year, but the privatisation authorities are now planning to split it up and sell it to portfolio investors. The recent sale of Russia's debut Eurobond and American Depositary Shares in gas monopoly RAO Gazprom have demonstrated enormous interest from portfolio investors in Russian paper. But it remains to be seen whether the Russian authorities will be able to attract foreign investors to Svyazinvest in the way they want without a Western investment bank as adviser. The property committee said work was already underway on privatising Svyazinvest according to the new scheme. "If all sides agree in coordinating their work, it is expected that the first sales of shares of this company will take place at the beginning of next year," the committee said. At 1010 GMT Rostelekom was $2.33 in a weaker market after closing on Monday at $2.42. --Jonathan Lynn, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
MCAT	U.S. West Coast crude prices added to early gains by 15 cents, but differentials for Alaska North Slope (ANS) stayed the same as traders failed to strike fixed deals. The West Coast market stayed quiet on Thursday, with players leaving businesses to attend a golf tournament, traders said. The discount for ANS remained $2.30 off November West Texas Intermediate (WTI). Recent strength in crude and weak margins soured them on current offers. Traders saw no effect from a fire at a Shell gasoline distribution terminal in Los Angeles.   Meanwhile, weak margins could force Ultramar to cut runs at its Wilmington, Calif., plant starting in late October. Ultramar said it refused to buy an ANS cargo for November, which would trim its crude input 12,000 barrels-per-day. Tosco Corp was also considering run cuts at its California refineries, traders said. Outright ANS prices rose 15 cents to $22.95/23.25 a barrel, in line with WTI. Bellwether WTI gained on supportive data from Thursday's Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, which showed crude inventories fell 3.3 million barrels last week compared to the API's 417,000 barrels.   Buyers claimed the Ecuadorian government's decision to cut prices for Oriente crude on Thursday would put pressure on ANS. The South American crude competes with ANS out West. Line 63 diffs remained unchanged at $3.20 to $3.00 under spot WTI for November delivery. ARCO will announce November shipping restrictions for the line next week, traders said. California heavy crudes remained flat. Kern River crude was $17.30/17.50 a barrel. Values for Wilmington crude stayed at $18.65/18.75 a barrel. -- David Brinkerhoff, Los Angeles bureau, +1 213 380 2014
CCAT	First Leisure Corp confirmed on Thursday that it planned to invest 55 million stg in new units in 1996/97. The bingo, bowling and nightclubs group said trading in the early part of its new financial year had generally been in line with the second half of last year. But it had been hit by cold weather in the important period just after Christmas. The company said it looked to the medium and long term with confidence and said new investments should underpin a significant growth phase into the next century.   First Leisure reported a nine percent increase in pre-tax profit to 43.7 million stg in the year to October 31. Excluding the benefit of asset disposals, pre-tax profits were up eight percent at 42.1 million stg. The company said it planned a major expansion programme in nightclubs with six openings lined up for this financial year. Its Health & Fitness development programme was reported to be making "significant progress" and contracts have been signed for eight new openings. Excellent results were reported from the Brannigans Music Bars and a significant expansion programme was continuing there. But trading in bingo and theatres fell below expectations. "These (record profits) are driven by excellent results in our three largest divisions where our previous investments have borne fruit as consumer confidence has recovered," chairman Michael Grade said in a statement. "Our developing Bingo business has not yet met our profit expectations but this has been balanced by accelerated progress in a number of other new areas, including the expansion of the Brannigans Music Bar chain and our Health and Fitness clubs." -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8793
GCAT	Six astronauts boarded the space shuttle Atlantis on Sunday for a predawn blastoff on a mission that will take them to Russia's Mir space station. NASA officials said the countdown was ticking smoothly toward a 4:27 a.m. EST (0927 GMT) launch from Florida's Kennedy Space Centre. The astronaut crew, led by mission commander Mike Baker, began taking their seats aboard the $2 billion spaceship at about 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT). Joining Baker were copilot Brent Jett and mission specialists Jeff Wisoff, John Grunsfeld, Marsha Ivins and Jerry Linenger. Atlantis was to drop off Linenger on Mir for a four-month stay and pick up John Blaha, who has been aboard the orbiting complex since September. Linenger, a 41-year-old Navy captain and medical doctor, is to spend four months on Mir, performing more than 80 experiments. Atlantis is due to return to the station in May to bring him home. Forecasters were predicting cool but fair weather for the night liftoff. They gave Atlantis a 70 percent chance of getting off the launch pad during its narrow seven-minute launch window. NASA launch commentator Bruce Buckingham said the shuttle's fiery climb to orbit on a northly trajectory should be visible along much of the U.S. East Coast. Atlantis is the first of eight launches planned in 1997. The year is due to end with the first shuttle mission to assemble the NASA-led international space station.

GCAT	Prisoners in a Brazilian jail are holding one prison guard hostage and have killed three detainees after a failed jailbreak attempt, a prison official said on Sunday. A group of prisoners tried unsuccessfully to escape on Sunday, sparking a rebellion involving all 500 detainees at the jail in Praia Grande, a coastal city 50 miles (80 kms) south of Sao Paulo. "For the time being we think at least three prisoners have been killed but we don't know for sure as the rebellion is not over yet," the official said. The prisoners, armed with knives, were demanding the transfer of 15 detainees to another jail, he added. "We are negotiating with them. Yesterday they didn't want to go because it was night. Today they don't want to go because it is Sunday," the official said. The three detainees who were killed were part of a group of around 50 prisoners kept in a maximum security area, he added. The rebellion followed another thwarted jailbreak attempt a few days ago in Sao Paulo when four prisoners and a guard were killed when five detainees tried to escape from Carandiru, Latin America's largest prison, using a garbage truck.
GCAT	Many cities stage African-American arts festivals, but few can lay as much claim to preservation of the crafts, arts, architecture, music, and language of Africa and the Caribbean as this former U.S. colonial slave port. "Moja, A Celebration of African-American and Caribben Art," a weeklong festival running here through Sunday, is a colourful panoply of theatre, dance, music and visual arts. It includes, for example, a tribute to Josephine Baker of 1920s Paris' "La Revue Negre," a juried arts show, jazz, and reggae block parties reminiscent of Caribbean festivals. But the Moja festival, which takes its name from the Swahili word meaning "one," also pays homage to home grown arts and artists who carry on centuries-old traditions. "The whole idea of Moja is to foster appreciation for African-American artists' contribution to world culture," said Ellen Dressler Moryl, city cultural affairs office director. There's a competition in South Carolina's country art of sweetgrass basketmaking -- which are woven row upon row and taught by mother to daughter only on the sea islands of South Carolina and Georgia, and the west coast countries of Africa. Master blacksmith Philip Simmons, 83, has been signing minatures of the wrought-iron gates he has forged since the 1940s. Named a national treasure, he has built on the tradition of colonial slave ironwork preserved here. In the galleries of the Dock Street Theatre, the oldest public theatre in the country, hang the family and heritage storytelling quilts of local quilter Marlene Seabrook. This week, the Charleston Symphony Orchestra will perform the U.S. premiere of "Charlestonia" by Edmund Jenkins, an African-American expatriate who was a fellow at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He lived in Paris most of his life and was a prolific composer of what was called American "symphonic jazz" in the early part of this century. He was the son of the Reverend Daniel Joseph Jenkins, founder of the Jenkins Orphanage and its world-famous travelling jazz bands who played "The Charleston" on street corners here. But shunned as a black classical composer in this country, Jenkins wrote "Charlestonia" in 1917 in Europe and based its melodies on tunes sung by African-American fishermen and dockworkers on the wharves of Charleston. It was first performed in Belgium in 1925, but was lost with Jenkins' other work after his death, only to be found within the last few years in a steamer trunk in a relative's home. Composer Vincent Plush has reconstructed the piece. An original play, "Hush Dat Gullah," nods to the unique "geechie" people of the isolated sea islands who have preserved their cultural attitudes, customs, relgious practices and Gullah language, which contains much West African syntax and vocabulary, through 300 years. For years, said Art Gilliard, executive director of the festival who is directing the play, it was not a language that people were proud of or aspired to speak. "Hush Dat Gullah lets people know that there's no need to be ashamed of your language. It's the only language that depicts who you are and where you came from," Gilliard said. "We really are trying to highlight or showcase the things that have a direct link to Africa ... that comes from the Motherland."

GCAT	Most Republicans put on a brave face after a Capitol Hill appearance by Bob Dole and Jack Kemp on Wednesday, but one warned a poor showing at the top of the ticket would cost Republicans control of Congress. "Bob Dole is in a real uphill fight," Representative Chris Shays said. He said experts in the party believe Republicans stand to gain if Dole wins and hold their own if he loses by 55-45 percent but anything less than that would be a disaster. "Anything close to 60 percent (for President Bill Clinton) we're out of power," the Connecticut congressman told reporters. "So that's definitely a factor." But Republicans, who won control of both houses of Congress in the 1994 elections for the first time in 50 years, said that concern was not why less than half of the nearly 300 Republicans in Congress attended the Dole-Kemp rally. The real reasons, they said, were that many members were out of town, there was late publicity for the meeting, they were very busy and heavy rain slowed traffic. Dole tried to calm the fears of some Republicans that the election could turn into a rout. "I want to say to those faint-hearted people in the audience -- there are probably not very many --  don't worry about this election," he said. "We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win." Members tried to reflect his optimism despite his standing in public opinion polls, which show him 15 points or more behind Clinton. "I think we've got to be optimistic," said Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota, adding that he would welcome Dole into his state to campaign for him. "I'm not faint-hearted. We're going to win. He said it three times." Other senators also accentuated the positive. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said Dole's speech marked "real progress." Pete Domenici of New Mexico called it "uplifting" and Orrin Hatch of Utah said its message "will resonate." Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas said she was "optimistic" and Alfonse D'Amato of New York said the final result would be victory for the Republicans. But how can they win when Dole is running so far behind? Representative Jerry Lewis of California said in his state Dole was behind Clinton "by only 15 points ... in the nine counties outside Los Angeles he's dead even. We need to identify and deliver that vote. California's still in the mix." No matter what happens, Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour said he felt confident members of Congress would stay together with Dole and Kemp. "The fact of the matter is issues unify Republicans," he said. "The record of this common sense Republican Congress unifies our party." But Shays argued that it was Kemp and Dole who had walked away from Congress, not the other way around. "I want my presidential candidate to talk about what we have done in the past two years," he said, charging that Dole had failed to highlight the success of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's "Contract with America." That has allowed Democrats to define Congress in a negative way, he said. "This isn't an issue of our distancing ourselves from them, they basically have distanced themselves from Congress," Shays said of Dole and Kemp.
GCAT	Sri Lanka police arrested the brother of a former mayor and six others in connection with the killing of a ruling coalition legislator whose death sparked riots in southern Sri Lanka this week, police said on Friday. Colombo police headquarters said in a statement that a special police squad probing the killing of Nalanda Ellawala had arrested Sunil Prematilleke, brother of ex-Ratnapura mayor Mahinda Ratnatilleke. The two named suspects in the killing, Ratnatilleke and lawmaker Susantha Punchinilame of the main opposition United National Party (UNP), were not among those detained. Police sources in Ratnapura said those arrested on Friday were junior UNP activists involved in election campaign disturbances before the shooting. They have to be produced before a magistrate within seven days under current emergency laws. Police on Thursday issued a one million rupee ($17,500) reward for information leading to the arrest of MP Punchinilame and ex-mayor Ratnatilleke. Gunmen shot and killed Ellawala, 29, a member of parliament from the ruling People's Alliance on Tuesday during a roadside quarrel in Ratnapura, 80 km (50 miles) southeast of Colombo, between his supporters and rivals from the UNP. Pro-People's Alliance supporters in Ratnapura set fire to scores of buildings owned by their UNP rivals in riots on Tuesday and Wednesday, but the area was under control by the Thursday, police said. No one was hurt. People's Alliance lawmakers said hundreds of thousands of people were expected to attend Ellawala's funeral on Saturday and warned of more violence. The killing came a day before the deadline for filing nominations in the March 21 local elections, the first electoral contest between President Chandrika Kumaratunga's People's Alliance and the UNP since 1994, when the alliance ousted the UNP from 17 years in power. The UNP's working committee said it had suspended the party memberships of Punchinilame and Ratnatilleke on Friday after party leader and former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe called on the two suspects to turn themselves in.

ECAT	Swiss gross domestic product (GDP) was unchanged on an annualised, seasonally-adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of 1996 compared with the third quarter, the Federal Office for Economic Policy said on Tuesday. The third-quarter decline was revised to 0.6 percent from the 0.7 percent originally reported. For all of 1996, GDP fell 0.7 percent compared with 1995, extending a slide that has kept the economy basically stagnant since 1990. GDP rose 0.1 percent in 1995. The economic office's director said it expected a modest upturn in 1997. "We expect a rise in 1997 GDP of around 0.5 percent," director Hans Sieber told Reuters. He said fourth-quarter 1996 data showing GDP stagnated compared with the third quarter indicated that the economy was moving through its trough in the winter semester 1996/97. "We assume that the second half of 1997 will be better. In particular we expect positive momentum for foreign demand in light of significantly better exchange rates as well as somewhat better economic perspectives in Europe," he said. This momentum will not be enough, however, to spark a self-sustaining rebound in a domestic economy still undergoing deep structural changes, he added. "For 1997 we expect only modest overall economic growth, in the first semester continuing stagnation but in the second semester clearly better results. We are emerging from stagnation but one should not be too optimistic."

GCAT	Not too many countries issue commemorative telephone cards to mark World Cup qualifiers -- but Malta have done just that before their group six game against the Faroes Islands on Wednesday. It was issued as part of the drive to get the Maltese public behind their team for what is a crucial qualifier for both countries. Not that it will have the slighest bearing on a place in the finals in France next year -- but because it may determine who will end up with the wooden spoon at the bottom of the group. For the two teams go into the match having lost all 11 qualifers they have played between them, scoring five goals and conceding 49. So plenty of pride will be at stake when the two tiny island nations meet at at the Ta'Qali stadium. Malta are currently bottom of the group having lost all six matches with a goal tally of 0-27 while the Faroes record is not much better -- in fact it is almost as as bad -- played five, lost five scored five, conceded 22. If they can't work out which team is the least worst on Wednesday, they meet again in the Faroes on June 8. Ticket prices have been slashed in a bid to revive flagging public support, and state telephone company Telemalta has issued the commemorative phone card with a picture of the Maltese team "We are expecting a win. The Faroes are not inferior to us, but they are certainly not better either," said Joe Mifsud, a senior UEFA official and the president of the Malta Football Association. Maltese national coach Milorad Kosanovic, a Yugoslav, said there was plenty of enthusiasm in his squad. Buoyed by the news on Tuesday that his only doubt, skipper Silvio Vella had passed a fitness test after being injured in training, Kosanovic said he was looking forward to this match. His team would be especially careful of the Faroes one potent weapon -- their swift counter-attacks. Faroe Islands coach, former Denmark midfielder Allan Simonsen was more philosophical, saying when he arrived in Malta on Sunday that he preferred playing against top teams because that was the only way soccer could improve. "Our nation is a cluster of islands and it is difficult for the players to train together except for a few days before each match," he said. Malta go into the game after losing 6-0 to Yugoslavia, 6-0 to the Czech Republic, 6-0 and 2-0 to Slovakia and 3-0 and 4-0 to Spain. The Faroes have lost 3-1 and 8-1 to Yugoslavia, 2-1 and 3-0 to Slovakia and 6-2 to Spain. All that matters now is avoiding bottom place when the qualifiers end in October.

The move by Allen McClay comes as the group prepares for a 180 million stg floatation, and will leave him with 47 percent of the company. McClay founded Galen in 1968 after working as a pharmacist for Glaxo for 13 years. THE TIMES -- ROBINSON CALLS FOR SHAKE-UP OF ITV NETWORK The chairman of Granada has called for reform of the structure of the independent television network ITV. Gerry Robinson said that the current regime, in which ownership is limited to a maximum of 15 percent of the total television audience, was "ludicrous and costly", and predicted that the network would ultimately be controlled by just one media player. He said reform was necessary to allow ITV to compete with other UK broadcasters. -- GRANT GETS EXTRA 1.8 MILLION STG Sir Alastair Grant, the former chairman of supermarket chain Safeway, has been given 510,480 shares as part of a long-term incentive plan for executive directors. At current prices the shares are worth 1.84 million stg, and follow the award of some 382,860 shares in May. The payments relate to performance achieved in the period between April 1994 and March 1997. -- JAPANESE PROSECUTORS RAID RETAILER'S HEADQUARTERS Japanese retailing chain Jusco Co has seen its headquarters raided by Toyko prosecutors just 24 hours after the company's president was arrested in connection with a racketeer scandal. Jusco, which is Japan's third biggest supermarket operator in terms of sales, and which holds a 15 percent interest in UK fashion and fabrics retailer Laura Ashley, is not itself implicated in the inquiries. However, the events have tarnished its image and led to a fall in the price of its stock in Tokyo. THE GUARDIAN -- FREE SHARES AN ILLUSION, SAYS NATIONWIDE The Nationwide, now Britain's biggest building society following the floatation of the Halifax, has warned that "free shares" are an illusion. Announcing pre-tax profits of 264.8 million stg, compared to 395.6 million stg the previous year, Nationwide also criticised its banking competitors for racing to increase their mortgage rates. -- REGULATOR TURNS FIRE ON TRAIN FIRMS Rail regulator John Swift has ordered train companies and station operators to improve service standards or face the prospect of substantial fines. Continuing his tough new approach to the industry, Swift said Wednesday that he has told operators to ensure that services provided a "seamless national network" promoting competition and co-operation for passengers. -- DIXONS AVOIDS WARRANTY TAX BY GIVING SHOPPERS NEW KIND OF COVER High street electrical retailer Dixons has found a way to bypass the higher rate insurance premium tax (IPT) on its product warranties. The new 17.5 percent rate on the warranties was announced in the last Budget from Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, an increase from 2.5 percent. However, Dixons has reacted by offering service contracts, which are not classified as insurance policies and so do not attract the 17.5 percent IPT. THE INDEPENDENT -- GOVERNMENT SEEKS UNION ADVICE ON WINDFALL TAX PITFALLS Unison, Britain's largest union, has been approached by the government to offer advice on how to prevent privatised utilities cutting costs in order to pay the proposed windfall tax. The union, which has 1.3 million members, offered proposals ranging from outright compulsion through to persuasion via tax breaks. Unison also told the government that full protection for employees against windfall-tax related redundancies would require special provision in the legislation. -- OFTEL PUSHES TO KEEP PHONE BAN Telecommunications industry regulator Don Cruickshank is reported to have advised the Department of Trade and Industry that the ban which prevents British Telecom from broadcasting entertainment down its phone network cannot be lifted unilaterally without a much broader and more lengthy review of broadcasting policy. The Oftel submission casts doubt on the strength of BT's "special relationship" with the new government, which had indicated the ban could be lifted in exchange for BT connecting schools and libraries to the Internet for free. -- IONICA SET FOR 625 MILLION STG FLOAT TO DO BATTLE WITH BT Radio-based telecommunications group Ionica is seeking a stock market floatation next month that will value the business at 625 million stg. Ionica, which was formed five years ago, is constructing a domestic telephone network based on innovative radio technology which it hopes will compete against British Telecom. The company hopes to attract investors in part due to the very low capital expenditure of setting up its infrastructure.

GCAT	Pakistan's ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto remained a virtual prisoner in her official Islamabad residence on Wednesday, but has been allowed to meet party colleagues and take telephone calls, a government official said. "She met three or four party colleagues last night and received calls from former ministers," the official said, adding that restrictions on Bhutto might be lifted within a day. Bhutto was sacked on Tuesday for a second time in her turbulent political career by the country's president, who accused her beleaguered government of corruption, nepotism and misrule. There has been no official word on Bhutto's status, but she has not been allowed to leave the prime minister's elegant house on a hill overlooking Islamabad and police guarding the gate turned away many people who tried to visit her on Tuesday. Lawyers for former defence minister Aftab Shaaban Meerani filed a habeas corpus petition in a Rawalpindi court on Tuesday, pleading that she had been "held unlawfully incommunicado". The court set a hearing for Wednesday. "The cabinet, which is meeting at 11.00 a.m. (0600 GMT), may take a decision on her and Zardari today," said the government official, who asked not to be named. He said Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto's husband, had been flown to Rawalpindi, near Islamabad, late on Tuesday from Lahore, where he had been detained soon after President Farooq Leghari dismissed Bhutto's government in the early hours. The official did not say where Zardari was being held, but newspapers said he was in the city's large Adiala jail. It was not clear if any charges had been brought against Zardari, who is at the centre of corruption allegations levelled against Bhutto's government, in which he was investment minister. Zardari has in the past denied any wrongdoing. He has also denied accusations by lawyers for Ghinwa Bhutto, widow of Benazir Bhutto's slain brother Murtaza, that he was part of a conspiracy that resulted in Murtaza's killing by police in Karachi in disputed circumstances on September 20.
GCAT	Feeding off tinder-dry pines, a forest fire broke out in this Atlantic County township in southern New Jersey, forcing police officers to evacuate 100 homes in a development called Totem Village. "The fires has taken out 1,000 acres plus. We have no control and no containment," said Sam Moore, a field officer for the state Forest Fire Service. The fire broke out at about 4:30 p.m. EDT in the Wharton State Forest and by sunset had tripled in size. The plume of smoke could be seen for 30 to 40 miles, as far away as Philadelphia and Trenton. No injuries or property damage were reported. It was the second major fire in as many weeks in the vast scrub forest called the Pine Barrens -- much of it a state wildlife preserve. On July 19, flames destroyed 800 acres but spared two retirement communities in Ocean County.
ECAT	Dougherty Dawkins, Strad & Bigelow, Inc. said it won $1.3 million Inver Grove Heights, Minn., (corrects from Minnesota State Armory Building Commission) armory bonds, with a net interest cost of 5.877 percent.
CCAT	Mission West Properties said Tuesday that J. Gregory Kasun, president, chief executive officer and director, and Harve Filuk, vice president, have resigned from their positions with the company. The company said in a release that the resignations come following completion of the sale of substantially all of its real estate assets earlier this year. Mission West added that Richard Tartre also resigned as a director of the company. Succeeding Kasun and Filuk are Michael Earley, president and CEO, and Mark Foletta, vice president, the company said. Earley and Foletta are presently directors of the company and executive officers of Triton Group Ltd, Mission West's largest shareholder. Katrina Thompson, the company's chief financial officer, continues in her position, Mission West added.
GCAT	Cuban leader Fidel Castro will be invited to attend a first European Union/Latin America summit scheduled to take place in either Panama or Brazil in the next 18 months, EU officials said on Tuesday. "I am glad to say that a summit will take place although we do not yet have a final date or venue," said one diplomat attending a meeting of EU and Latin America foreign ministers at this Dutch seaside town. Asked if Castro -- increasingly being isolated by Western governments who have lost patience with his unwillingness to accept democratic reform in Cuba -- would be invited, the diplomat said: "At this stage, yes. We all want him to come." Officials from Europe and Latin America were on Tuesday comparing calendars to see when a summit could take place. The EU has ruled out any time during the current Dutch and forthcoming Luxembourg and British presidencies as the 15-nation bloc is likely to be too occupied by economic and monetary union matters. Officials said the task of co-organising the summit is likely to fall to Portugal, which takes charge for six months in the second half of 1998. Although the EU does not have political links with Latin America as a whole, the summit will be arranged by combining the San Jose and Rio groups -- the two organisations with which the Europeans do have links -- and any countries not in either. Castro's invitation is likely to irritate the United States which has made no secret of its desire to see Havana isolated by the international community. EU and Latin American nations, however, favour dialogue with Castro as a means of prising Cuba out of the communist shell it has occupied since 1959.
CCAT	Emons Transportation Group Inc on Wednesday said preliminary results for fiscal 1997 show the company handled record numbers of freight carloads and intermodal trailers and containers. The company said carloads of freight handled during the year ended June 30 rose 7 percent to 37,000. Intermodal trailers and containers transported rose 50 percent to 12,900. In the fourth quarter, the company handled 9,400 carloads, or 7 percent more than in the year-earlier quarter. Trailers and containers rose 46 percent to 3,300 from the fourth quarter of the previous year.   The company will report its financial results in early September, Chairman Robert Grossman said. He declined to provide any details on expected results. The freight transportation and distribution services company, based in York, Pennsylvania, serves the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the United States. It owns three short-line/regional railroads, operates rail/truck transfer and warehouse facilities and a rail intermodal terminal. It also provides logistics services. Also on Wednesday the company said about 1,426,000 shares of its common stock and 586,000 shares of its convertible preferred stock will be released from escrow. The escrow was created in 1986 as part of a Chapter 11 reorganization plan of its Emons Industries Inc subsidiary. Emons said the shares released from escrow will be distributed to about 700 holders who were claimants. The company has 5,800,624 common shares outstanding and 1,650,857 preferred shares outstanding.
MCAT	The sudden malaise afflicting U.S. stocks has likely been exaggerated by a holiday-thinned market, analysts said, and a rebound is generally expected to occur soon. Stocks have suffered from a sudden rise in interest rates, set off by a series of surprisingly strong economic reports that have pummeled the bond market over the last two sessions. Over that time, the Dow industrials have fallen more than 150 points, pulling global stock markets lower in the process.   But analysts generally discounted the move, predicting a recovery could start as soon as Monday. "I think you'll see the stock market rebound in a big way," said Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Van Kampen American Capital. "You're sitting here in January, when a lot of 401(k) money is available. This is going to be viewed as a classic buying opportunity." The broad sell-off in financial markets began on Tuesday after stronger than expected home sales and consumer confidence reports and gained new vigor today from a robust National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) report.   The NAPM index, which measures manufacturing activity, spooked the bond market by jumping to a 54.0 reading in December from 52.7 in November, showing the economy had finished 1996 with surprising momentum. The report sent the long bond tumbling 1-10/32, pushing the yield up to a key level of 6.75 percent. Prior to the NAPM release, the long bond had been 1/4 point higher. "Economists were looking for an abnormally low reading because they thought factories would close for more than a day with Christmas in the middle of the week," said Philip Orlando chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management.   Even after the report, analysts remained skeptical of arguments the economy was running too hot. "I don't consider it so strong that we're in an economy that's overheating," said Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter, adding that with the key monthly employment report due January 10, "We'll have much better numbers to look at next week." Absent a clear signal of inflation, Canelo said he expected stocks would actually benefit from the NAPM surprise. "Even if bonds remain under pressure, it will eventually dawn on the stock market that this is good news because it improves the outlook for earnings," he said. Regardless of how the coming sessions unfold, the back-to-back economic surprises have touched off jitters for a market that only recently had dropped its guard on inflation. "Before this I think most of the market was looking at January as being mostly non-events," Froehlich said. "Now I think you'll be seeing people sharpening their pencils and viewing January's economic releases as very, very important." ((-- Wall Street desk, 212-859-1730))
MCAT	Seoul stocks closed higher on Friday as offshore funds bought some blue chips on bargain hunting, brokers said. "Offshore funds seem to be betting on the belief that such stocks were oversold recently as a result of Kia's troubles," said Na Min-ho, a broker at Daishin Securities. The composite stock index closed 7.65 points higher or 1.03 percent at 747.37. "A handful of blue chips led today's rise. It is hard to tell whether the market will rise further tomorrow," said Choo Hee-yup of Dongwon Securities.   Trading volume totalled 40.98 million shares, compared with 44.02 million on Wednesday. The market was closed on Thursday for a national holiday. Gainers outpaced loseres 410 to 370 with 119 unchanged. Brokers said rumours on an early expansion of the foreign stock ownership limit helped buoy overall sentiment. Officials at the finance ministry flatly denied the speculation. Samsung Electronics gained 1,700 won to 68,100 and KEPCO was up 1,100 won to 27,800. POSCO also closed 1,200 won higher at 64,000.   Five of Kia's six listed companies went limit-down and the banking sector remained weak from the Kia shock. Kia Motors fell 900 won to its lower-limit of 11,500, but Asia Motors gained 80 won to 3,350. "Investors began to buy Asia shares because the price was so cheap," said Na of Daishin. The sub-index for bank shares fell 0.46 percent to 339.63. Korea First Bank, a main creditor of Kia, dropped 170 won to 3,050.   SKC Ltd  43051.KS, which began trading for the first time on Friday, and two other IPO shares ended the day higher, the Korea Stock Exchange said. Shares of SKC, storage media producer unit of the Sunkyong Group, closed at 22,600 won, up 1,600 won. Volume totalled 449,000 shares. Young Chang Silup Co, a leather goods maker, ended 1,400 won higher at its daily upper limit of 19,900. Volume was low with 320 shares changing hands. Hankook Steel Co 60040.KS, a machinery and equipment maker, closed at 2,800 won at its limit high of 38,800. There were only buy bids.
CCAT	U.S. rating agency Standard & Poor's said Friday it would add a new drilling company called Transocean Offshore Inc to its MidCap 400 Index next month. The agency said Transocean, which will be formed by a merger, would replace CML Group at the close of trading September 3. Transocean will also belong to its 400 Oil & Gas (Drilling and Exploration) industry group, it said. The agency said Sonat Offshore Drilling Inc is to merge with Norway's Transocean ASA to form Transocean, which will be based in Houston, Texas. The new company will be a contract driller specialized in deep water and harsh environment drilling, it said. The agency said it would replace Sonat with Titan Wheel International Inc in its SmallCap 60 Index after trading on September 3. Titan, which makes and markets steel wheels and rims for agricultural and construction equipment, will also get on the SmallCap 600 Trucks & Parts industry group in the capital goods sector, it said. -- New York Newsdesk 212 859-1610
GCAT	The Burmese government said on Thursday that the Australian charge d'affaires in Rangoon had apologised after his wife forcibly took down a national flag flown at a residence in the compound where they live. Rosalind Eva Ransome, wife of charge d'affaires Simeon Richard Gilding, demanded that a Burmese family living in their compound take down the flag, which they had hoisted in commemoration of the golden jubilee of Union Day on Wednesday. Local employees refused to take down the flag but Ransome pulled it down herself, a government statement said. A member of the Burmese family decided to complain to local authorities about the incident. "The Australian charge d'affaires came to the office of the local administrative authorities with his wife later that day and tendered his apology for the incident, it is learnt," the statement said. Gilding declined to commment on the incident and referred all inquiries to the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Australia.
GCAT	A U.S. State department report on global human rights criticised certain areas of Irish life, citing problems in state prison facilities, the level of abuse of children and violence against women, Irish media reported on Friday. The report for 1996, which looks at human rights conditions around the world, said the physical infrastructure of the Irish prison system was barely adequate and that overcrowding and sub-standard facilities caused human rights problems. It said human rights observers were also sceptical about a government plan to expand Dublin's Mountjoy prison. The report said there were human rights problems in other areas such as Ireland's special detention powers, instances of abuse by police and police officials, abuse of children and discrimination and violence against women. The report said "travelers" remain the single most discriminated ethnic group in Ireland. -- Dublin Newsroom +353 1 676 9775

CCAT	ITT Corp. on Wednesday rejected Hilton Hotels Corp.'s unsolicited $6.5 billion takeover offer, saying it was inadequate and not in the best interests of ITT shareholders. The rejection by ITT's board came a day after Hilton expressed its determination to press ahead with its takeover offer of $55 a share for the lodging and gambling company. ITT said in a statement that keeping the company independent would be in the best interests of its shareholders and other constituents, and that it would seek various options to increase the company's value. New York-based ITT also said the Hilton offer did not reflect the inherent value of ITT, which owns and operates Sheraton hotels and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas and Reno, Nev., and Atlantic City, N.J. The statement was apparently in response to Hilton's announcement Tuesday that it might reduce its bid if ITT took measures to reduce the proposed merger's value. "We do not intend to be deterred from pursuing our offer by any actions that you may choose to take," Hilton Chief Executive Stephen Bollenbach said in a letter to ITT Chairman Rand Araskog. Hilton, apparently preparing for a fight to control the ITT board as part of its takeover bid, also on Tuesday named 11 candidates for ITT's current board seats, and named 14 others whom could be added if ITT attempts to thwart Hilton's bid by boosting the number of board members. ITT said Wednesday that it was reviewing various options to increase the value of the company, including "monetizing" or otherwise realising the value of ITT's non-core assets. "The issue is creating shareholder value, both short- and long-term," Araskog said in ITT's statement. "We plan to deploy our financial resources only to those assets that produce superior current and future earnings growth." Araskog said there were "serious business conflicts which have always confronted a (potential) Sheraton/Hilton combination." He said owning and managing multiple hotels under each brand in dozens of the same cities would create material conflicts of interest. As part of its response to Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Hilton's offer, ITT said it was filing counterclaims to litigation Hilton filed against it in a Nevada federal court. ITT said it was seeking to enjoin the offer and other relief because of Hilton's "misappropriation and misuse of confidential ITT information, including information obtained in violation of a 1996 confidentiality agreement between ITT and Bally Entertainment, now part of Hilton." Alternatively, ITT said, it was seeking to compel Hilton to disclose information about its offer required under federal securities laws. ITT's shares closed Tuesday at $56, after rising from the low $40s when Hilton made its offer to acquire the company Jan. 27.
CCAT	Philippine coconut products exports dropped by 42 percent to 1.154 million tonnes in copra terms from the year-ago 1.979 million tonnes, preliminary data from the trade group United Coconut Associations of the Philippines Inc (UCAP) said. The exports included copra, coconut oil, dessicated coconut and oleochemicals, UCAP said in a report on Wednesday.
ECAT	Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Tuesday he did not see any current inflation dangers in the Indian economy and that he was not concerned by growing foreign reserves tied to the strengthening rupee. Chidambaram, who said in mid-May he was against a stronger rupee because exporters would complain, on Tuesday told a news conference that liberalised trade policies must be implemented. But he said the rupee would be defended from speculators. "The reserve bank's policy is not to allow the rupee to be driven by speculators. Otherwise the value will be determined by the market," he said. The rupee currently stands at about 36 to the dollar, and the central bank has had to intervene regularly to stop it appreciating due to growing pressure from investment inflows. "We must liberalise trade. We must encourage more import of capitalised goods," Chidambaram said. "If industry picks up, then imports will pick up." He said he was not concerned about growing foreign reserves in India, which now stand at about $24 billion. "We must use these reserves creatively. We should not fall into a trap of reducing reserves. "We must use them to encourage trade and investment." Chidambaram also said he was pleased that a committee appointed by the Indian central bank had voted in favour on Tuesday on his proposal to take steps needed to float the rupee as a fully convertible currency by the turn of the decade. "You can be assured that I will allow for a wide discussion on the report and then make a decision as soon as possible," Chidambaram said of the report released on Tuesday in India. Asked how he would implement the report's recommendations, which charts a path for the rupee to be convertible by 2000, he replied, "I am determined to overcome all obstacles in all fields. We are reformers." Chidambaram said Indian inflation remained in single digits at about six percent and he saw no reason for concern even though the government is considering raising petroleum prices. "We hope to keep inflation at that level," he said of the annual inflation rate of 6.3 percent seen so far in the 1997/98 financial year that began on April 1. "It might rise if we correct petroleum prices but it should then standardise," he said. "We believe investor and business confidence has improved." Chidambaram noted the government raised petroleum prices last July, which prompted inflation to rise. But he said it then tapered off to end the year at 7.3 percent. "Even if inflation rises as a result of some price increases, good management of money means we can bring that under control," he said. The decision-making steering committee of India's ruling United Front is scheduled to meet next week to reach consensus on increasing oil prices, which is required to repay money owed to oil companies for selling products well below global prices. The outstanding amount, called the oil pool deficit, totalled 155 billion rupees ($4.33 billion) at the end of March and is expected to rise to 245 billion rupees by the end of next March, according to government figures. "We need to make another correction," he said of current petroleum prices. "We will take a decision on June 15 and I have no doubt in my mind that, once the --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
GCAT	Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi, ignoring demands by opposition and church leaders, told a state rally on Sunday there would be no change to the constitution before elections later this year. As he did so, security forces battled looters in a run-down area of Nairobi in a renewed flare-up of the rioting that paralysed the capital on Saturday. "The current atmosphere is not conducive to meaningful discussion on subjects such as the constitution. Such discussion can only be held meaningfully after the general elections," said Moi, defying demands by opposition and church leaders. "A commission will then be appointed that will take into account all interested parties," he said before a crowd of around ten thousand. Scores of residents in the outer business district battled police and paramilitary General Service Unit (GSU) troops on Sunday in a continuation of Saturday's riots, Reuters photographer Tony Njuguna said. Residents set tyres on fire to hamper police access and looted shops in rioting not prompted by an opposition protest call or the rally in central Uhuru (Freedom) Park. Security forces fired teargas into one building and beat suspected looters senseless when they staggered out. Around 10 people were arrested, witnesses said. Rioting brought Nairobi to a standstill on Saturday after security forces broke up a banned rally by opposition and church groups pressing for a minimum package of constitutional change prior to presidential and parliamentary elections. One person died on Saturday, according to newspaper reports, and scores of shops and stalls were looted. But there was no sign of protest at the state rally itself, which was guarded by hundreds of heavily armed paramilitary General Service Unit troops, police and plainclothes agents. Four opposition parliamentarians and at least two activists were placed under house arrest prior to the event, apparently part of precautions against a repetition of the Saturday protests, opposition spokesmen said. Those detained included NDP leader Raila Odinga, FORD-Asili chairman Kenneth Matiba, FORD-Kenya chairman Michael Kijana Wamalwa and Paul Muite of FORD-Kenya who is also an activist in the unregistered Safina party. Moi, addressing the annual Madaraka (Self Rule) Day rally, said the Public Order Act used to regulate public meetings would be replaced by a new bill, but gave no details of how it would differ. "A new legislation entitled the Peaceful Assemblies Bill will soon be presented for debate in parliament. This will replace the Public Order Act," he said. Opposition National Development Party (NDP) secretary-general Charles Maranga poured scorn on Moi's speech and said the party would still press for change. "Moi is trying to hoodwink Kenyans. This is not enough. We are going to press for minimum constitutional reforms before the elections," Maranga told Reuters. President Moi must call elections by the end of 1997 pitting the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) against an opposition undermined by ethnic, political and personal disputes. Opposition, church and human rights groups under the National Convention Assembly (NCA) umbrella argue that fair elections are impossible under a constitution designed for a single-party state. The NCA wants six pre-independence laws scrapped including the Public Order Act that regulates public meetings. They also demand an independent electoral commission and greater access to state-controlled Kenyan radio and television. "Granting constitutional change after the election is like giving medicine to a person already dead," Timothy Njoya, a moderator in the Presbyterian Church of East Africa said on Saturday. Moi came to power in 1978 on the death of Kenya's first president Jomo Kenyatta. Kenya's first multi-party elections were held in 1992, when Moi defeated opposition contenders amid charges of rigging and widespread violence.
CCAT	Emery Worldwide, a subsidiary of U.S. based CNF Transportation Inc., won a contract from Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE) totalling 4,000 to 5,000 kg daily air freight from Sweden to the U.S., VCE said on Thursday. VCE, the construction machinery and equipment subsidiary of Swedish vehicle maker AB Volvo, said in a statement it would begin sending shipments of spare parts for construction vehicles and equipment to its Chicago warehouse by air instead of sea. VCE's spare parts distribution centre is based in Enskilstuna, Sweden, which is 120 km west of Stockholm. "The stock order to fill up the U.S. warehouse has been shipped by ocean for many years," VCE transportation spokesman Goerdt Schlickum told Reuters. "We have decided to move the stock order...by air and now we have 72 hour service," he said. Demand for VCE spares within North America has risen 25 percent in the past three years, VCE said. VCE keeps over 130,000 different parts in stock with which it serves a network of over 200 dealers in the U.S. and its own sales operations. -- Abigail Schmelz, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700-1003
GCAT	Gay groups expressed regret on Saturday that President Bill Clinton, acting in the dead of night, signed legislation into law that gives states the right not to recognise same-sex marriages. Clinton put his signature to the law at 12:50 a.m. EDT (0450 GMT) at the White House, then went to bed upon his return from a four-day, cross-country campaign swing. Separately, Clinton praised the Republican Congress for moving toward approving a guarantee of longer hospital stays for new mothers and requiring more equitable treatment of mental-health benefits under private health insurance plans. In a written statement issued on Friday night during a campaign stop in South Dakota, the president said he was signing the same-sex legislation because he has "long opposed governmental recognition of same-gender marriages, and this legislation is consistent with that position." But the White House made clear Clinton felt the legislation was produced by Republicans trying to make gay rights an election-year issue. "We think this bill is completely politically motivated and completely unnecessary," said deputy press secretary Mary Ellen Glynn. The Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest national lesbian and gay political organisation, was relatively restrained in its criticism. "We regret that Clinton opted to sign this needless and mean-spirited bill," said the group's executive director, Elizabeth Birch. "We had hoped that the president would have changed his mind after hearing the anti-gay rhetoric spouted by some extreme members of Congress." Steve Michael, president of the local Washington chapter of the national AIDS activist group ACT UP, blasted Clinton's decision and said it would cost him the votes of gay and lesbian voters in the Nov. 5 election. "It is clear by his middle of the night stealth vote that Clinton knows what he is doing is wrong," Michael said. "We will remember his betrayal on Nov. 5." The bill, approved by the Senate earlier this month and by the House in July, was passed out of fear that a pending court case in Hawaii would set a precedent for legalising gay and lesbian marriages. No state legally recognises marriage between two people of the same sex. The law recognises each state's right to determine its own policy with respect to same-sex marriages and clarifies for purposes of federal law that a marriage is between a man and a woman. "With the stroke of his pen, he has condoned the exclusion of all lesbian and gay Americans from the federal benefits and responsibilities that come with marriage, even though it will be years before such an institution becomes available to them," Birch said. Gays overwhelmingly supported Clinton's election in 1992. The Clinton campaign believes they will still back him this year since the new law does not take away any current gay rights and since same-sex marriages has not been a top priority for the gay community. In his weekly radio address, Clinton sought election-year credit for legislation moving in Congress to extend hospital stays for new mothers and expand insurance coverage for mental health patients. House and Senate negotiators approved the plans on Thursday and final enactment could come next week. "I will sign it with enthusiasm," Clinton said in his weekly radio address. The longer hospital stays for new mothers -- 48 hours for normal deliveries, 96 hours for Caesarean sections -- were driven by complaints from many families that insurance companies will only pay for a woman to remain in the hospital for 24 hours after giving birth. The mental health provision would require insurance companies to provide much more generous spending benefits for people suffering from serious mental illnesses. Businesses had opposed the provisions.

ECAT	Russia needs to step up efforts to bring inflation within its goal of one percent per month, but it will not rely on money supply limits alone, Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin said on Friday. "In the first quarter of this year there has been little appreciation of the real exchange rate, so we need additional efforts to control inflation," he told a conference on Central and Eastern European capital markets. Dubinin said annual inflation should be about 12 percent in 1997, down from about 22 percent last year when the increase in M2 money supply was about 34 percent. "Last year the depreciation of the rouble against the dollar was less than inflation," he added. He said monthly inflation in the first quarter of this year was averaging 1.5 percent, while depreciation of the exchange rate was less than one percent. Dubinin told Reuters that intermediate money supply targets, which have been a key weapon in the fight against inflation in recent years, would continue to be used. But he said a Lombard window had also been opened, allowing banks to borrow from the central bank using state securities, treasury bills and OFZ government bonds, as collateral. "We have stopped strictly controlling part of the money supply by volume," he said. "We are counting more and more on automatic regulation, because this money is received by banks at a rather high interest rate." Dubinin said this was a flexible market-based way of regulating the liquidity in the banking system and the economy as a whole. "What is important is not so much quantitative limits to M2 or other money supply aggregates but strict observance of market demand for money," he said. --Brian Killen, London newsroom +0171 542 4889

GCAT	Up to 500 Northern Ireland police separated rival Protestant and Catholic demonstrators on Sunday to prevent any clashes during marches in the flashpoint town of Bellaghy. Police said the march passed peacefully after they formed a buffer zone and blocked rival parades. "We have no reports of any bother anywhere," a police spokesman said. Protestants of the powerful Orange Order, a civil organisation with its roots in pro-British Protestant loyalties, handed a letter of protest to a senior policeman accusing Britain of breaching their human rights. A Catholic leader told reporters that security measures were "a curfew of the nationalist people" and blamed the Protestants for parading through the overwhelmingly pro-Irish town. The Bellaghy parade was one of the first of the Protestant marching season, which police had feared could cause a re-run of last year's violence, the worst in the province for decades. Millions of pounds (dollars) of damage was caused in a showdown between members of the 60 per cent Protestant majority and 40 per cent Catholic minority whose conflicting British and Irish loyalties are the heart of the Northern Ireland conflict. The season reaches a climax in the first two weeks of July, when Protestants celebrate centuries-old battlefield victories over Catholics which entrenched a Protestant pro-British majority in what became Northern Ireland. Local Catholics in Bellaghy, which is south of the province's second city, Londonderry, had said they would hold a 12-hour counter demonstration at what they see as attempts to intimidate them by the majority pro-British community. Northern Ireland police chief Ronnie Flanagan on Sunday praised a decision by one Catholic priest to end a Saturday night service at Harryville, north of Belfast, which has been the centre of Protestant protest for more than 40 weeks. The priest, Canon Sean Connolly of Our Lady's Church, said that he would cancel the service until September, when the annual marching season ends, in the hope of defusing tension. Flanagan said: "It is a really genuine and sincere effort to reduce tension and I would like to see that regard for others being repeated." Harryville was picketed by pro-British Protestant loyalists for weeks in protest at the refusal of Catholics in the nearby village of Dunloy to allow an Orange Order parade there. The British government, churchmen and other mediators have tried in vain to get Loyalists and Catholic nationalists to negotiate a compromise over this year's marches, but Orange Order leaders refuse to hold face-to-face talks with Catholics. They believe Catholic residents are being manipulated or infiltrated by activists of Sinn Fein, the political wing of Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas fighting British rule. The main headache among security chiefs is the annual march from a small church at Drumcree through the Catholic Garvaghy Road area of Portadown, south of Belfast. Flanagan said there would be no repeat of last year's handling of the parade, which was banned until Protestant rioting forced a U-turn decision and unleashed a wave of Catholic fury in parts of the province. The Drumcree parade, which marks Northern Ireland soldiers who died for Britain in the World War One battle of the Somme, will be staged on July 6, six days before the climax of the marching season, the "Glorious Twelfth". This anniversary recalls the victories of King William of Orange over King James ll, a Catholic, in the religous wars of the late 17th century.

ECAT	Argentine President Carlos Menem promised Monday to subject proposals to double personal wealth tax to close scrutiny in order to avoid scaring capital away from the country. Menem is trying to push through Congress a new tax package to help bridge the budget deficit. But he was reported to have promised a business conference Friday he would block attempts by deputies from his own Peronist Party to double the tax on assets of over $102,000 to 1.0 percent from 0.5 percent. "We have to study this very deeply to avoid injustices and of course to head off the possibility of capital leaving or not coming to Argentina because of unconsulted measures," the president told ATC state television. "We have to see what we tax, whether we tax a factory that already pays tax or machinery, or just luxury goods," he said. Economy Minister Roque Fernandez, trying to head off a budget gap he said could hit $6.6 billion this year, promised to share the wealth tax with the provinces instead of revenues from his new fuel taxes -- a much more liquid source of cash. But Peronist deputies on the Budget and Finance Committee of the lower house of Congress defied Fernandez last week by proposing to the double the tax when they debate the bill. Local business leaders reacted with alarm and the head of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, Julio Macchi, called it "a blow to the very foundations of our capital market", since the base of the wealth tax includes stock holdings. "I prefer a rate of 0.5 percent," Fernandez told La Nacion newspaper Sunday. Peronist deputy Humberto Roggero, head of lower house's Industry Committee, said Monday he would propose that if the wealth tax is doubled, the taxable base should be raised to $250,000 from $102,000 -- "a more logical level." Roggero said he would also propose that "productive" assets such as factories and machinery, and stock and bond holdings, be exempt from the personal wealth tax. -- Stephen Brown, Buenos Aires Newsroom +541 318-0695
GCAT	Big crowds in Taiwan greeted the Dalai Lama's "enlightenment" tour on Tuesday while officials were reported to be working on booking meetings between Tibet's exiled spiritual leader and Taiwan's leaders. The Dalai Lama, scorned by Chinese communist authorities as a Tibetan separatist, began the fourth day of his unprecedented Taiwan stay at Fu Jen Catholic University. He then moved to an arena for a marathon inter-denominational gathering of religious groups witnessed by some 20,000 people -- the second of three stadium-sized "enlightenment meetings" on his six-day tour. With less than 48 hours left in Taiwan for the Dalai Lama, who is revered by Tibetan Buddhists as a god-king, officials remained tight-lipped on expected meetings between the 61-year-old monk and Taiwan's top leaders. The Government Information Office said it knew nothing about a report in the United Evening News that Vice President Lien Chan, who doubles as cabinet chief or premier, would dine with the Dalai Lama on Wednesday. "We have received no information," a government spokesman said by telephone. "It is not in the premier's schedule." The newspaper said Lien's appointment with the Dalai Lama was to discuss details of the Tibetan's likely meeting on Thursday with President Lee Teng-hui -- an encounter that communist China has condemned as the collusion of "splittists". Beijing on Tuesday continued a series of attacks, scorning the Dalai Lama's statement the day before that he sought only self-rule for Tibet, not independence from China. "On one side the Dalai Lama publicises internationally the view that he does not want Tibetan independence, on the other side he everywhere engages in activities to split the motherland," Beijing spokesman Cui Tiankai told reporters. "This makes clear he is basically not sincere and has certainly not put aside his stance for so-called Tibetan independence," Cui said. The Dalai Lama has said he hoped to discuss "spiritual reforms" with President Lee, who said he welcomed a meeting. Taiwan officials have refused to comment. Local media said the two would meet on Thursday at the foreign ministry's Taipei Guest House rather than the Presidential Office in a bid to play down the political nature of their first face-to-face encounter. Since his arrival on Saturday, the Dalai Lama is known to have met only a few senior Taiwan officials, including Interior Minister Lin Feng-cheng and Provincial Governor James Soong. He was expected on Wednesday to meet the leader of Taiwan's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, Hsu Hsin-liang. The exiled Republic of China government that has existed only on Taiwan since its 1949 civil war loss of the mainland still maintains that the island should one day reunite with China, though not before Beijing adopts democracy. But Taiwan's democratic reforms since the 1980s have given new voice to open calls for a sovereign Republic of Taiwan. That angers China, which calls Taiwan a rebel-held region that must "reunify with the motherland". The Dalai Lama has tried to play down the political implications of his journey to Taiwan -- his first return to Chinese territory since he and thousands of followers fled Tibet in 1959 after Beijing crushed an anti-Chinese uprising. Despite China's attacks, a Taiwan newspaper poll showed that more than 50 percent of residents support a Dalai-Lee meeting, believing it would help improve Taiwan's relations with the exiled Tibetan government.

GCAT	A goalkeeper was taken to a police station and charged with assault after punching a referee who sent him off during a match at the Maracana stadium. Valtenir, who plays for Rio Branco, left the Maracana in a police car surrouned by four officers after referee Kleber Goncalves made a formal complaint during Thursday night's match against Flamengo in a Copa Brasil match. Valtenir was shown the yellow card for time-wasting after half an hour of the game, reacted by throwing the ball at the referee, and was immediately sent off. On being shown the red card, Valtenir rushed at the match official and grabbed him by the neck. He then punched him twice and kicked him before police stopped the attack. He left the pitch shouting "the referee's been bought by Flamengo" into the microphones of radio and television reporters. Valtenir was released by police after being charged and refused to make any comment. His actions soured what should have been a night of glory for the part-timers who come from the small city of Rio Branco, in the heart of the Amazon rain forest near the border with Peru. Most of the players had never visited Rio de Janeiro before and had only dreamt of playing in the Maracana. Rio Branco won the first leg of the second-round tie 1-0 at home last week when Flamengo sent a reserve team to spare their star players the exhausting plane journey. On Thursday, they held on until the last minute of the first half when Romario scored for Flamengo. Romario scored again after the interval as Flamengo went on to win 5-1. The Copa Brasil involves the winners of the 27 state championships played throughout the country and is designed to give teams from remoter areas the chance to play against the big clubs. Flamengo joined Atletico Paranaense, Vitoria, Gremio, Corinthians, Internacional, Ceara and Palmeiras in the last eight.

GCAT	An Australian doctor who has helped four people die under a world-first voluntary euthanasia law said on Monday the euthanasia battle would go on even if parliament killed off the law. Speaking hours before the Australian Senate was due to vote on a bill which would quash the Northern Territory law, Dr Philip Nitschke said he believed the legislation had been shown to be viable. "It didn't spell the end of the world, the sky didn't collapse, we got workable legislation," Nitschke told reporters. "Opponents of this progressive change can never again say that this law doesn't work...the world will never be the same again." The anti-euthanasia bill, which has already received a clear majority in the lower house, calls on the government to use its constitutional powers over Australia's territories to quash the Northern Territory law. However, the national government does not have the same power over Australia's largely autonomous states and Nitschke said the fight would continue. "The way to change it, I suppose, is for the Territory to become a state," he said. "These changes will occur," he added. "The question is, will it occur in the Northern Territory or will it occur somewhere else?" Four people have died using the Northern Territory legislation, which has been condemned by church, political and Aboriginal leaders. Two others are ready to use the law even if Senate quashes it.

Dealers said unlinked bonds traded quietly. Dagan said the Makam closed almost unchanged on very low volume of only 20 million shekels. Dollar-linked bonds closed lower after the shekel rose against the dollar. In the local market, the representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.3650 shekels against 3.3730 shekels on Wednesday.

GCAT	Mortars or rockets fired from Lebanon landed inside Israel's northern border early on Wednesday, security sources said. Israeli troops were checking the area after the attack around 2 a.m. on Wednesday (2300 GMT on Tuesday). Security sources said several mortar bombs or rockets fell in the eastern Galilee region near populated areas, but there were no reports of casualties. Prosper Azran, mayor of the northern Galilee town of Kiryat Shmona, said the shelling was "with complete certainty" directed at civilian areas. He told Israel's army radio that residents sensed an increase in tension on the Israel-Lebanon border and were preparing bomb shelters, although they were not under army orders to do so. "These are orders of the heart and of experience," Azran said. "I remember many days like this in the past year." On Tuesday, Hizbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon fired a Katyusha rocket into northern Israel in apparent retaliation for Israeli shelling that killed two Lebanese civilians in south Lebanon on Monday. Other rockets were fired at targets inside Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone. One hit a farm near an Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia outpost, injuring a farmer and his 15-year-old son, militia sources said. Several mortars and rockets have been fired by the pro-Iranian Hizbollah this month, most apparently aimed at Israeli troops patrolling the south Lebanon occupation zone. "The Katyusha rocketing was in response for the continued violation of an April 1996 understanding which bans firing on civilians," a Hizbollah spokesman told Reuters in Beirut on Tuesday. Israel and Hizbollah undertook not to fire on civilian targets under the 1996 ceasefire understanding which ended 17 days of an Israeli onslaught on Lebanon in which about 200 people -- mainly civilians -- were killed. Israeli shelling on Monday night killed two civilians in the village of Berti, east of the southern port city of Sidon. The shelling came after two SLA militiamen were wounded in a Hizbollah rocket attack on their outpost. Israel carved out its south Lebanon occupation zone in 1985 to protect its northern border after withdrawing the bulk of a force which invaded Lebanon in 1982. Hizbollah is fighting a guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops from south Lebanon.
MCAT	Tokyo naphtha prices were notionally lower in light trading on Tuesday, pressured down by the decline in crude oil prices, traders said. Traders, back from a long weekend, said the market was off to a slow start with few fresh incentives to stimulate trading. Open-spec naphtha for first-half July was nominally assessed at $206.00/$207.00 per tonne, while second-half July was notionally assessed at $207/$208.   Traders' prompt cargoes were weak and heavily in contango. "It's only until you get to second July onwards do we go back to backwardation...that's because the physical (market) certainly looks weak in the prompt," one trader said. Discussion in gas oil remained light due to ample domestic stocks and slack demand, traders said. --Tokyo Energy Desk +81-3-3432-8837

GCAT	The victorious South African Springboks left Paris on Sunday looking ahead to what they regard as the ultimate test -- the Tri-Series in the southern hemisphere next season. "The Springboks have been very successful," said coach Andre Markgraaff of a tour in which South Africa have won four tests, two in Argentina and two in France -- including Saturday's 13-12 second test victory -- with an unchanged side. "But we won't see the result until next year in the Tri-Series," he added. South Africa, rebuilding after their World Cup triumph on home soil last year, regard their arch-rivals New Zealand and Australia along with themselves as the three best sides in the world. Springboks assistant coach Nick Mallett said: "I saw a very good French team, very different to that in Bordeaux (which lost the first test 22-12). "France are still the fourth team in the world," he said. Before Saturday's decisive test, Markgraaff had said: "We are playing for our future in the second test. If we win the series in France, we will have proved, in South Africa, that we're on the right track. We need this second win against France to start 1997 on the right foot." The results obtained by southern hemisphere teams currently touring Europe are ample proof, if it was still needed, of where the game's power base lies. South Africa, Australia, Western Samoa and the New Zealand Barbarians -- virtually the All Blacks -- have all enjoyed significant successes in Europe in the last month. Only the amateur Argentine Pumas look likely to cede a win to Europe when they face England at Twickenham on Saturday. The French, at a precarious stage in their rebuilding for the 1999 World Cup, could not find the answers to South Africa's extremely efficient although not revolutionary game. This is galling for the French who regard the touring team as quite beatable and feel they could have won if they had not been deprived of at least six key players through injury. But they have recognised that the Springboks are brilliant at their game based on the power of their forwards and crunching tackling in defence. "A Springbok on the field means tackle, tackle, tackle," said Mallet. Markgraaff, however, is wary of the limitations of South Africa's game when it comes to the crunch encounters with their southern hemisphere rivals. "This is not exactly how we want to play but the players want to win and that's what is most important on tour." The French have taken heart from a much improved performance after their poor showing in Bordeaux last weekend. "What we must hold on to is the team's capacity to recover on a mental level," said manager Jo Maso. "If one day we manage also to steady and develop our game, we'll have a great team." Coach Jean-Claude Skrela said: "We were perfect as far as the challenge was concerned but we lacked tactical lucidity." He particularly criticised his team's poor tactical kicking in open play. France will need to work hard on their game with newly acquired young players like promising wing Laurent Leflmand, who won his first cap on Saturday, for the Five Nations tournament next year in which holders England start as favourites. Giant number eight Abdelatif Benazzi, who took over the captaincy from injured wing Philippe Saint-Andre, said: "The (Five Nations) tournament is coming up and we must relearn our basics."
MCAT	NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures ended steady to higher Wednesday in a lackluster session, then moved a bit higher on ACCESS after weekly AGA stock data showed a lower-than-expected build, industry sources said. Earlier, Dec gained 6.9 cents to close at $2.864/mmBtu, then climbed on ACCESS to a new high of $2.88 after the AGAs. But the rally was short-lived, as Dec prices soon drifted back to the mid-$2.80s. January settled up five cents at $2.828. "The first reaction to the (AGA) report was short covering, but now it looks like profit taking," said one Midwest trader, noting cold weather expectations have buoyed prices this week.   AGA said Wednesday that U.S. gas inventories rose last week by 34 bcf to 85 percent of capacity, still 256 bcf or nine percent below year-ago levels. Eastern stocks climbed to 95 percent full, about even with last year, while producing region storage at 73 percent still lagged 1995 by 16 points. An earlier Reuter poll showed most expected a weekly build of 43-50 bcf. While technical traders said the market was overbought and due for a pullback after a 12 percent rally in four sessions, fundamental traders said cold weather later this week and next could keep early-November cash firm and underpin the board. December support was still seen in the $2.66 area and then in the low-$2.50s. Resistance remained at the $2.88 contract high and then at $2.92 and $2.98, two prominent spot continuation highs set in late June and early July. Cash sources said November prices Wednesday were notional at best, with most sidelined waiting for next month's flows to begin. Early-November Midcon climbed almost a dime to the mid-to-high $2.70s on prospects for well-below normal weather in the region this week. November Gulf Coast gas was talked up a couple of cents to the $2.70-2.75 area but no deals were reported to confirm levels. New York city gate gas prices notionally slipped slightly to the high $3.20s. The 12-month Henry Hub strip rose 1.2 cents to $2.279. NYMEX said 35,974 Hub contracts traded, up from Tuesday's revised tally of 32,327. NYMEX Alberta natgas closed 1.5 cents higher at a new contract high of $1.23, while deferreds again were untraded but settled steady to up one cent. NYMEX said 16 Alberta contracts traded compared with 38 on Tuesday. NYMEX December Permian natgas was untraded but ended up 15 cents at $2.69. NYMEX said 45 Permian lots changed hands versus 80 on Tuesday. On the KCBT, December finished eight cents higher at $2.71, while deferreds ended steady to up six cents. The December East/West spread narrowed by 0.9 cent to 15.4 cents (NYMEX premium). --J Silha, New York Power Desk 212-859-1624
ECAT	Venezuelan consumer prices rose 1.6 percent in March, compared with a 6.2 percent rise in March 1996 and a 2.3 percent increase in February this year, the central bank said on Tuesday. It was the fifth consecutive drop in the monthly inflation rate, which has slowed from a peak of 15.6 percent in May. Cumulative inflation in the 12 months to the end of March 1997 was 74.8 percent, compared to 78.1 percent in the 12 months to March 1996, the central bank said.
CCAT	Bolivia's state-owned oil company Yacimietos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) sold three of its four operating units for a total of $835 million in a round of privatization spin-offs on Thursday. Bidders from the U.S., Europe and Latin America came up winners, with U.S. major Amoco Corp the biggest spender in its $307 million bid for Chaco Sam -- a YPFB exploration and production unit with a book value of just $155 million.   A largely Argentine consortium including YPF SA and Perez Companc bought Andina Sam, another YPFB exploration and production unit for $265 million. The consortium also included Plus Petrol Bolivia in a bid that was twice Andina's net worth of $130 million. Another consortium consisting of U.S.-based Enron Corp and Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group spent $264 million for YPFB's transportation unit, Empresa Transportadora de Hidrocarburos SAM. YPFB had set Empresa Transportadora's book value at just $98 million.
ECAT	African finance ministers said on Tuesday the qualifying criteria for debt reduction under an IMF initiative were too rigid and might kill a well-meaning project. The criteria took no account of differing conditions under which countries implement economic reforms, and no note of poverty resulting from reforms. The ministers were speaking in Addis Ababa at a conference of African finance ministers and of officials of major multilateral institutions including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). "The IMF is displaying its usual fears, over-caution. That will blunt or completely kill an instrument that would have been productive," Tanzanian Finance Minister Daniel Yona said. "The six years required (of good economic performance) is too long. History explains that these institutions (IMF and World Bank) have always been too cautious, which is wrong. Some countries could qualify after two years," he added. He said the problem with World Bank and IMF bureaucrats was they saw nothing wrong in their planning, assumed they never made mistakes and sat on a high pedestal. "Governments keep changing. World Bank officials are there for 20, say 30 years. That's the problem," he added. This month the IMF and the World Bank gave their stamp of approval for a debt relief plan for Uganda, making it the first candidate for the Debt Initiative for Heavily Indebted Countries (HIPC). But Ugandan Minister of State for Finance Basoga Nsandhu said Uganda was "confused and baffled" by a decision to put back to next year the date Uganda should benefit from the initiative. "We do not understand these people," said Nsandhu. "We put money earmarked for servicing debt to rehabilitating roads, hospitals and increasing opportunities for primary education. Now we hear this money is not coming on time." He said Uganda had expected the reduction as early as September but now was told it might come sometime next year. Nsandhu said Uganda qualified under any criteria. If Uganda encountered difficulties with the initiative then it was unlikely any other African country could qualify. Africa's international debt stands at around $340 billion. In general, a country is required under the initiative to establish a six-year record with IMF tutorship that shows strong efforts on economic reform, although substantial flexibility is provided on a case by case basis. The initiative was undertaken when it became clear that the repayment of old loans to lending agencies such as the World Bank and IMF were draining some of the poorest countries, making it impossible for them to get on their feet no matter what reform efforts they made. The World Bank has set aside $500 million for an initiative fund while other donor agencies have so far raised $43 million. World Bank Vice-President for Africa Jean-Louis Harbib said Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast were the other African candidates for the programme and 10 countries were targeted this year. The initiative could lead to a reduction of $385 million of Uganda's $3.4 billion international debt.
MCAT	Italian shares slipped back to a lower close on Friday after touching record highs as Wall Street showed sharp losses in the afternoon and profit taking set in on telecom stocks as a major Italian merger was completed. The all-share Mibtel hit another high of 14,928 before settling to close off 1.92 percent at 14,541, while the blue chip MIB30 opened at a new record 22,806 but again slipped back throughout the day to end down 2.26 percent at 22,096. Dealers said that after the early stock rise many investors cashed in on the day their monthly options expired and immediately sold shares. Telecoms slipped after the STET-Telecom Italia merger was completed today. The newly-merged group to be know as Telecom Italia SpA starts trading Monday. STET ended off 7.19 percent at 10,849 lire and Telecom down 5.08 percent at 6,220 lire. Financial stocks had a mixed day after recent heady rises with Comit off 2.16 percent at 4,387 lire and Ambroveneto up 0.98 percent at 8,560 lire. Giant insurer Generali was 3.18 percent down at 36,563 lire. Olivetti slipped 4.06 percent to 461 lire after unions called a one day strike at the trouble company for mid-September.
CCAT	Transport group TNT Ltd said on Wednesday its airline group Ansett Holdings Ltd made a net profit after tax but before abnormal items of A$1.14 million in the year to June 30, down from A$27.20 million in 1994/95. Ansett's profits after abnormals, however, rose to A$19.11 million from A$9.06 million in 1994/95. TNT announced earlier this week it would receive cash receipts of A$325 million for the sale of its 50 percent stake in Ansett to Air New Zealand Ltd.   The Ansett profit figures obtained from TNT's accounts conflict with the brief commentary in News Corp Ltd's annual results released last month, which said Ansett made a small loss, but did not specify the size of the loss. News Corp owns 50 percent of Ansett. A TNT spokesman said the difference was due to a different accounting treatment. The higher profit after abnormal items was due to currency gains, the spokeman said. Analysts have generally said Ansett made a pre-tax and pre-abnormals loss of about A$10 million in 1995/96.
ECAT	The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has cut its rediscount rate to 23.5 percent from 27 percent with effect from Friday, the state-owned Herald newspaper reported on Saturday. The paper quoted the bank as saying the move was expected to boost economic activity. "The bank said in a statement that the reduction, which comes on the back of declines in inflation rates, is expected to see banks lower their lending rates and provide the much needed relief to the productive sectors," the Herald said. "This would underpin the strong growth the economy is currently experiencing," it added. Zimbabwe's annual inflation rose to 16.4 percent in December from a seven-year low of 13.9 percent in November. Although a recent spate of price increases are expected to increase January's inflation figure, many analysts still expect annual inflation to stay in a 16-18 percent range in the first quarter of 1997. Last year, the Reserve Bank cut the rediscount rate first by two percent to 27.5 percent and then by 0.5 percent to 27 percent in October 1996. -- Harare newsroom +263-4 72 52 28/9
ECAT	Economic growth should reach three percent in the 29-country OECD this year, its strongest level in nearly a decade, but Germany and other European Union states run the risk of a "jobless recovery", according to an OECD report. The twice-yearly report by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development predicts non-inflationary growth of 3.0 percent in 1997 and a slightly slower 2.7 percent rise in gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998. The OECD, which has expanded from a grouping of established industrial nations in the 1990s to embrace Mexico, former Soviet bloc countries and South Korea, said over half of its member countries could expect growth on this scale at national level, with the United States and Canada doing relatively better. But the outlook for Japan and major European Union countries, including Germany, France, Italy and some smaller EU nations, is less buoyant due to public spending restraint or other austerity measures and fragile consumer demand, the report says. Unemployment across the 29 countries is expected to fall by about a million to 35.2 million by 1998, with the jobless rate easing to 7.1 percent from 7.5 percent in 1996, but it remains a serious problem in Europe, especially in big continental states. "The weakness of employment growth in much of the European Union may revive questions of whether a 'jobless recovery' is in prospect in some countries, notably Germany," the June Economic Outlook report says. While improving employment often lags an upswing in economic growth, persistent and relatively strong productivity growth in the European Union may be due to high labour costs and intensive capital investment at the expense of labour, it says. The report says OECD economic growth should be helped by the need to meet rising demand in strongly growing non-OECD regions, above all from China and Asian countries. "Expansions appear to be strong and well established, even if they are in some cases now quite mature, in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and most smaller EU countries," the report says of OECD members. "Output has also been rising in Japan, Germany, France, Italy and several smaller EU countries, but at a more hesitant pace," it says. "In the major continental European countries, net exports have been a consistent source of strength, but consumer spending remains weak, while private investment has failed to strengthen much despite lower long-term interest rates." The OECD predicts U.S. economic growth of 3.6 percent this year, followed by a slowdown to two percent growth in 1998. "The economy may begin to slow in the second half of 1997 from its rapid first-half pace as the growth rate of domestic private spending tapers off under the weight of tighter monetary conditions, moderating income increases and the exhaustion of favourable stock adjustment effects," it says. The OECD said it was assuming another rise of a half of one percentage point in the U.S. Federal Funds interest rate "around the middle of 1997", after a quarter percentage point rise to 5.50 percent in March, the first in more than two years. The rise might be needed to slow economic growth, it said. The organisation expects Japanese growth of 2.3 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 1998. In the European Union, the OECD expects the German economy to grow 2.2 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 1998, while it predicts French growth of 2.5 percent this year and 2.8 percent next year. Both countries, along with Italy, will overshoot the deficit reduction target implied by a strict reading of the Maastricht treaty to qualify for a European single currency -- that public deficits must be limited to three percent of GDP. France's new left-wing government wants a more "flexible" reading which is not excluded by the treaty. The OECD says it expects public deficits in Germany, France and Italy to come in at 3.2 percent of GDP in 1997 -- the test year for European monetary union. It predicts Italy's deficit widening the year after but those of Germany and France falling in line with the strict Maastricht interpratation.

MCAT	The Shenzhen Stock Exchange will continue to take steps to activate its B-share market, Zhao Wenqi, senior economist of the exchange, said on Tuesday. The measures included improving regulation of B-share companies, requiring them to publish information more swiftly to increase their transparency, Zhao told a luncheon in Hong Kong. "We will also increase the number of listed B-share companies with larger capitalisation," he said. The exchange will also abide by the ban on Chinese investors buying B-shares, which are reserved for overseas investors, Zhao said. Regulations limit domestic investors to A-shares. "If they (Chinese investors) already hold some B-shares, they can only sell in the market," the economist said. Zhao said turnover on the Shenzhen B-share market in 1996 rose 987.45 percent from a year earlier, compared to a 1,209.45 percent increase in turnover value of the whole market. Nine new B-share companies were listed last year, bringing the total number of listed B-shares to 43, he said. Zhao said the Shenzhen market had started a study on the index futures but he declined to give details or a targetted launching date.

It also said that prices for water output, purification and distribution rose 18.7 percent over 12 months and for rubber and plastic production by 10.6 percent. Between April and May 1997, the biggest jump was in quarrying at 12.9 percent. Prices for electrical machinery production and electricity, gas, hot water and steam provision rose by 4.5 percent, including electricity production and distribution at 9.4 percent. The statement added that producer prices in several branches fell between April and May, including radio, television and communication equipment production by 1.8 percent and peat extraction by 1.2 percent. -- Riga newsroom, +371 721 5240

GCAT	The brother of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi denied on Wednesday that he had plotted to discredit an ex-magistrate who shot to fame by leading a judicial assault on corruption in high places. Paolo Berlusconi was testifying at a trial in which he and former defence minister Cesare Previti are charged with orchestrating a plot to besmirch the reputation of Antonio Di Pietro, a folk hero in Italy. Di Pietro quit as a magistrate in December 1994 for reasons that have never been explained. He resigned two months ago as public works minister when he himself came under investigation for alleged irregularities in his work as a magistrate. The Berlusconis have been at the centre of several investigations into graft carried out by the pool of Milan magistrates which Di Pietro spearheaded before his sudden resignation. Silvio Berlusconi is now on trial in Milan in two separate corruption cases linked to his media empire and which were investigated by Di Pietro and the "Clean Hands" pool of investigators. He denies all charges. Paolo Berlusconi, a close business associate of his brother, said he learned in the summer of 1994 that Di Pietro was planning to leave the magistrature as a prelude to launching a career in politics. That preceded the time when when prosecutors say a plot to pressure Di Pietro into resigning was hatched. Berlusconi said it was not until some months later that he advised Giancarlo Gorrini, then a friend of Di Pietro, to report alleged malpractices by the star magistrate to government inspectors probing the activities of the Milan magistrates. Gorrini had alleged that Di Pietro extracted a 100 million lire ($65,000) loan from him and then pressured him into providing a Mercedes car and work for his lawyer wife. His allegations formed the basis of a judicial investigation into Di Pietro last year after which a court ruled there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the former magistrate. Di Pietro is now under investigation again following separate allegations.

CCAT	Guinness Plc and Grand Metropolitan Plc Monday announced plans for the biggest merger ever in Britain, a $15.8 billion deal that would create the world's seventh largest food and spirits company. Grand Met, owner of Burger King and Pillsbury foods in the United States, also owns Smirnoff vodka and J&B whisky, while Guinness' brands include its well known stout, Johnnie Walker whisky and Gordon's gin. Among Grand Met's other products are Green Giant vegetables and Haagen-Dazs ice cream. The merger will create "a combined spirits and wine company which will truly be a world leader," Grand Met Chairman George Bull said at a news conference. Industry analysts said the two companies fit together well in terms of products and geography, and that the strength of the combined company could prompt other mergers among big food and liquor producers. "It makes total sense, there is virtually nothing that does not fit," said Dermot Carr, analyst at Nikko Europe. The merged company would have annual sales of about $22 billion, pretax earnings of $2.2 billion and a market value of $37 billion based on the stock prices Monday. The stocks of both companies rose as investors cheered the announcement. Under the proposed stock swap, Grand Met shareholders would end up with 52.7 percent of the new company, GMG Brands, with Guinness shareholders getting the rest. In addition to stock in the new company, shareholders will receive a total of $3.9 billion in cash. GMG Brands' four divisions would be United Distillers and Vintners, combining the liquor and wine operations, Pillsbury, Burger King and Guinness Brewing Worldwide. GMG Chief Executive-elect John McGrath said about 2,000 jobs would be cut, out of 20,000 in the companies' liquor business. The two firms employ about 85,000 people worldwide. The companies said they expect savings of $285 million a year in coming years from integrating sales forces, pruning corporate functions and other moves. Bull of Grand Met and Guinness Chairman Tony Greener have been friends and rivals for years, which led to the idea for the merger. "The discussions started because I invited Tony to dinner," Bull said in an interview. After Greener returned from a trip to Africa, the two met and the broad outlines of a deal were set within weeks. Bull said he did not expect the merger to face regulatory problems as the combined company would have 10 percent or less of world spirits markets. "We are entirely confident that we will be able to obtain the agreement of the regulatory authorities both here in Europe and also in the United States and elsewhere," he said. Some competitors complained the proposed merger was anti-competitive and said regulators would probably call for asset sales before approving the transaction. "The deal, in our view, poses serious antitrust problems in the U.S. and Europe and possibly elsewhere," said Robert Matschullat, vice chairman of Seagram Co. Ltd., which makes Chivas Regal, Seagram and other brands. Matschullat said Seagram has not determined if it will formally seek to block the proposed transaction. "I don't know if they think the regulators are asleep at the switch here, but we don't," he said. Analysts said Seagram and other competitors such as Britain's Allied Domecq Plc may be forced to seek merger partners of their own to compete. "All the others will be worried sick, but what are they to do," said analyst Ron Littleboy at Nomura Securities. "This group is now just so powerful and there is unlikely to be a deal open to others which offers the same scale of benefits." Other competitors would include Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsico Inc., Philip Morris Cos. Inc., and McDonalds Inc., the biggest restaurant chain in the United States ahead of Grand Met's Burger King, which is based in Miami. Bull will co-chair the new company with Greener but will retire as planned in July 1998, leaving Greener as chairman. Grand Met's McGrath will be chief executive, with the rest of the board made up of directors from both companies. The merger also means the Guinness name will disappear as a corporate identity after 238 years. Formed in Dublin in 1759, the brewer changed its name from Arthur Guinness & Sons to Guinness Plc in 1985. Grand Met also said pretax profit rose 3.5 percent to 471 million pounds ($764 million), excluding special charges, in the first half of its fiscal year.
GCAT	Joel Herzog, son of former Israeli president Haim Herzog, was taken into custody after being placed under investigation for suspected complicity in a French corruption scandal on Monday, justice sources said. Herzog, 47, was suspected of complicity in the payment of a 1.45 million franc ($290,000) bribe to Michel Mouillot, mayor of the French Riviera city of Cannes who is himself in jail awaiting trial, the sources said. Herzog, who is being held in Grasse prison, resides in Switzerland and holds dual Israeli and British nationality. He was placed under investigation in his capacity as an associate of international businessman Nissim Gaon whose empire includes the Noga-Hilton hotel in Cannes. Herzog is married to Gaon's daughter and is an administrator in the Noga group. The case involves a requested municipal permit to place an additional 100 slot machines in the Grand Riviera Casino situated inside the Noga-Hilton, the sources said. The magistrate investigating the case asked both Herzog and Gaon to appear in his chambers while warning them they might be placed in custody. Herzog came alone while lawyers for his 74-year-old father-in-law presented the magistrate with a written statement alleging the money was paid to Mouillot after pressure and threats from the politician, justice sources said. Another senior Noga group official, Briton Martin Conway, was placed in custody on November 22 after also being placed under investigation in the same case. Judicial sources said Conway told the magistrate that the Noga group paid the 1.45 million francs in four instalments ahead of a Cannes municipal council vote on the slot machine installation. Lawyers Ricard Banon and Daniel Diedler who accompanied Herzog told reporters their client presented himself spontaneously and was placed under custody because magistrates felt that was the only way they could establish the facts clearly. "This will be done without inhibition (by Herzog)," Banon said. Mouillot has been jailed since July, together with his son and several aides, on charges of seeking bribes from a British gambling group in exchange for permits to set up or expand casinos in the glitzy Riviera resort. Mouillot's lawyers have alleged he was the victim of political infighting between members of the ruling centre-right coalition. Mouillot is a member of the coalition's junior partner, the centre-right Union for French Democracy.
GCAT	A five-year-old girl in the east China city of Tianjin choked and almost died from cigarette smoke at her grandfather's birthday with relatives smoking for hours in a small room, the Wen Hui Bao newspaper said on Friday. The newspaper said the girl was rushed to hospital and found to be having extreme difficulty breathing. It said eight of the people at the party, including the girl's father, immediately announced they would give up smoking.
GCAT	Australia won their fourth test against the West Indies by an innings and 183 runs before lunch on the fourth day at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday, delivering a three-one series victory. Scores: West Indies second innings - 204 all out. (Brian Lara 78, Michael Bevan six for 82). Australia first innings - 517 all out from 162.3 overs (Overnight 434 for five) - (Matthew Hayden 125, Mark Waugh 82, Greg Blewett 99, Michael Bevan 85 not out). West Indies first innings - 130 in 47.5 overs (Michael Bevan four for 31, Shane Warne three for 42.)
MCAT	Implied volatilities for U.S. Treasury bond options pulled back Tuesday in the wake of the Federal Open Market Committee's monetary policy meeting. U.S. central bankers left short-term interest rates unchanged amid continued evidence of moderate economic growth and low inflation. The key federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans stands at 5.5 percent. October bond volatility slipped to 8.25 percent at the session's end from 8.40 percent on the opening and 8.65 percent the previous session.   Volatility for September options, which expire at the end of the week, fell to 7.0 percent from 7.8 percent at the opening, while December edged down to 8.6 percent from 8.7 percent. Bond options activity was hushed as the market focused on the outcome of the Fed meeting, traders said. Expectations that bond prices are likely to be confined to a range near term also stifled interest in trading options, they said.   At the short end, Eurodollar volatilities eased substantially after heavy buying of December 94.25 calls and stock market jitters had pumped up values during the previous two sessions, brokers said. December fell back to 7.5 percent from 9.0 percent previously and March dropped to 10.8 percent from 11.5 percent. "I don't think vols are going to get much lower," said one Eurodollar options trader. "The market's shown that it can move every now and then."   A U.S. bank that had been a huge buyer of the 94.25 December calls outright and in spreads against sales of 94.25 puts in recent days turned around and sold 5,000 of the calls today, floor traders said. Other firms were noted buying 93.75/94.00 put spreads and selling 94.00 straddles in December, and one bank bought 1,200 June 94.00 straddles.

ECAT	Britain had its largest current account surplus for nine years in the second quarter of 1996 and its overall annual economic growth rate was revised up to 2.2 percent, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. Official interest rates were left unchanged at 5.75 percent after Monday's monetary policy meeting between Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George. The current account deficit for the second quarter showed an unexpected 457 million pound ($712 million) surplus after a deficit of 786 million in the first quarter. Financial markets had expected a second quarter deficit of around 1.2 billion pounds. "This improvement was largely due to record surpluses on trade in services and investment income," the statistics office said. The current account surplus was the first for over a year and the largest since the first quarter of 1987. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.5 percent in the second quarter, up from the 0.4 percent growth government statisticians had previously reported. Annual GDP growth was now put at 2.2 percent compared with the previous estimate of 1.8 percent. "The figures show a healthy and sustainable economic performance," Treasury minister Angela Knight said. City economists said the figures added fuel to Bank of England Governor Eddie George's argument that interest rates should be raised to counter the risk of a future resurgence in inflation as the economy gathers steam. "Monetary policy is clearly too loose," said Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Morgan Stanley. The central bank conducted routine money market operations at unchanged interest rates on Tuesday morning, indicating that Clarke, who has the final say on monetary policy, had ordered no change in official rates at Monday's policy meeting. The Chancellor has cut rates four times since December and, with a general election due by May 1997, is clearly reluctant to raise them again. He overruled the Bank of England's call at the July monetary meeting for rates to be raised to six percent. "The debate will now clearly shift from possible rate cuts to whether the government can resist pressure for a rate rise before the general election," said Ian Stewart, UK economist at Merrill Lynch. A breakdown of the balance of payments figures showed a surplus on investment income in the second quarter of 3.7 billion pounds, the highest figure on record. Services showed a surplus of 1.9 billion pounds while trade in goods showed a marginally lower deficit of 3.6 billion. The revised GDP figures showed construction and a broad range of service industries growing much faster than previously thought. Alex Garrard, an economist at UBS, said recent buoyancy in retailing and signs of recovery in manufacturing suggested economic growth would pick up in the coming months. "With only subdued inflation left in Clarke's stock of feasible excuses, further rate cuts are almost certainly off the agenda for the time being," he said.  ($1=.6420 Pound)
CCAT	Trading company Nissho Iwai Corp said on Tuesday it had filed a shelf registration with the Finance Ministry to issue up to 200 billion yen of corporate bonds, effective for two years from January 25.
GCAT	Moslem worshippers rose from their weekly prayers at Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque on Friday to fresh confrontations with Israeli soldiers. Within an hour, three Palestinians were dead and more than 60 wounded. A 30-year-old Palestinian man, his shirt stained with blood from the casualties he helped evacuate, cursed the Israeli prime minister. "Damn you (Benjamin) Netanyahu, what kind of peace is this?" shouted the man. The tiny clinic below the seventh-century Dome of the Rock mosque, Islam's third holiest site, was smeared with blood. Medics bandaged the wounded and sent them off in private vehicles to Jerusalem's Makassed hospital. Women screamed in horror as hundreds of Israel's paramilitary border police, wearing bullet-proof vests and helmets, stormed the mosque and charged demonstrators. Bullets flew in all directions as demonstrators fled for cover. "God take revenge on you, you beasts," an elderly woman shouted as Israeli police used batons on a group of women sheltering below an arched gate of the Dome of the Rock. One woman fell to the ground while the others rushed inside the building. The confrontation was the bloodiest at al-Aqsa since 1990 when Israeli security forces killed 17 worshippers during clashes with stone-throwing Palestinians. Friday's violence was the latest round of Israeli-Palestinian fighting that erupted on Wednesday after Israel opened a tourist tunnel adjacent to the al-Aqsa mosque compound. Palestinians say the tunnel weakened the foundations of ancient buildings surrounding the mosque and threatened the holy sites. Israel said the tunnel did not harm the site. At least 53 Palestinians and 14 Israeli soldiers were killed in three days of gun battles across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israeli security forces, anticipating violence after Friday prayers, deployed thousands of security forces around the Old City of Jerusalem and at the gates to the mosque. Witnessess said the fighting erupted when a few young worshippers began throwing stones at Israeli security forces. Israeli officials said hundreds of rocks were thrown. Witnesses said the Israelis, stationed on buildings above the compound and at the gates, responded to the stones by unleashing barrages of live ammunition at the crowds. Many of the wounded were hit in the torso. Ayman Idkaidek, 28, took a direct hit to his head. Another man killed was also hit in the head while the third victim took a bullet in the chest. "Look. This is what Netanyahu is doing," said a 42-year-old Palestinian man at the hospital, displaying a piece of Idkaidek's shattered skull.
GCAT	A Japan-South Korea summit meeting had a stormy start on Saturday as Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was forced to apologise for inflammatory remarks by his spokesman about Tokyo's use of sex slaves in World War Two. Noisy protests by hundreds of ultra rightwingers against President Kim Youg-sam's visit added to the tension at the one-day meeting which had been intended to showcase the good relations between the two countries. Other issues of national pride at stake include competing claims for islands. The rightwingers drove 150 trucks with loudspeakers through this resort loudly denouncing "unreasonable South Koreans demands" for Japan to apologise for World War Two actions. Hashimoto was on the defensive from the moment the summit opened because of remarks by Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama that there was a "social background" to Tokyo's use of sex slaves, or so-called "comfort women", in the war. About 200,000 captured comfort women from Korea, the Philippines, China, Indonesia and the Netherlands were forced to work in front-line brothels in one of the darkest chapters of Japan's World War Two past. "It is odd teaching them (Japanese schoolchildren) of the comfort women issue, without teaching the social background of an authorised prostitution system at that time," Kajiyama, the government's top spokesman, said on Friday. "When they (comfort women) went to the fronts, they got money. Among them, there were some who were drafted," he added in remarks made only to Japanese reporters but later reluctantly confirmed by shocked Japanese officials. In an opening summit lunch, Hashimoto wasted no time in distancing himself from the comments. "On the issue of comfort women, I am worried about the impact of reported remarks by Chief Cabinet Secretary Kajiyama," Hashimoto told Kim. "I am sorry. That (view) is not our real intention." Repeating remarks he made in a summit meeting in South Korea with Kim last June, Hashimoto said there was no way for Japan to defend itself on the comfort women issue. "At no other time has women's honour and dignity been hurt more than in this case," Hashimoto said. Kim, already angry at the rightwingers reception, told Hashimoto South Koreans were outraged by Kajiyama's remarks. "The timing of the reported remarks is unfortunate. Explanations must be given to satisfy the Korean people who were shocked by the remarks," Kim told Hashimoto. "This issue is very sensitive on the part of the Korean people." A decades-long row over Japan's failure to fully apologise and pay official compensation to the women flared again earier this month when the Asian Women's Fund, a private group set up in 1995 with heavy Japanese government support, paid money to seven ageing Korean women. South Korea does not want government-to-government compensastion but believes Tokyo should compensate the sex slaves directly. The island ownership issue is equally emotive. Japan calls the two small islands Takeshima and South Korea calls them Tokto. They are surrounded by rich fishing grounds. Tokyo has claimed the islands since it started its 1905 colonial rule of Korea. South Koreans say they have owned the islands for centuries.
MCAT	The coupon rate for the Philippines' five-year fixed-rate Treasury note fell to 15.0 percent from the previous auction rate of 15.625 percent, the Bureau of Treasury said on Tuesday.   The average rate slipped to 14.927 percent from the previous auction's 15.510 percent. The five-year T-notes are auctioned every other month. The auction committee accepted 3.0 billion pesos out of 7.136 billion pesos worth of tenders. - Manila newsroom 63 2 8418938 Fax 8176267
ECAT	Rural lobby group Federated Farmers, hurting from the high New Zealand dollar, called on Thursday for government spending restraint to ease inflationary pressures. Federated Farmers President Malcolm Bailey was speaking to reporters at an exporters' summit in Wellington to discuss the sector's difficulties with the strong currency. "There is a problem. We believe that the dollar has climbed too far, too fast, and that that is putting a lot of pressure on the export sector," Bailey said.   "It's impacting quite negatively on farmers' income. We are not seeing farms' input costs coming down like they should be, so we are caught in a bit of squeeze. We are saying the dollar is overvalued." Bailey said the solution was not to "throw out the baby with the bathwater" and make fundamental changes to the Reserve Bank framework, which targets 0-2 percent underlying inflation. "We think inflationary pressures are largely coming from the government sector. We are calling for restraint. We are saying whatever promises were made during the election campaign to increase spending should be set aside," Bailey said.   Bill Gallagher, representing the NZ Manufacturers Federation, said the rate of appreciation in the exchange rate was affecting profitability and investment and would eventually impact on jobs. "The export-led recovery appears to be stalling. It's essential to make the exchange rate lower for the exporters." Gallagher, who is also chief executive of the Hamilton-based Gallagher Group which makes electric fence equipment, said the summit would look at ways of adjusting monetary policy to the business cycle.   Asked if the Reserve Bank should intervene directly in the currency market, Gallagher said: "It's likely to be a short-term fix. Short-term fixes tend to have long-term consequences." Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash, arriving to address the meeting, said he recognised exporters were under "very considerable pressure". -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 473-4746

CCAT	China is planning to invest 3.82 billion yuan ($460 million) to expand the Lanzhou Oil Refinery in China's western Gansu province, an official at the refinery said on Tuesday. The project, to be completed by 2003, would increase the firm's annual production capacity to 10 million tonnes from 5.5 million tonnes, the official told Reuters by telephone. The crude oil used by the plant is mainly from oil fields in China's northwestern region of Xinjiang, the official said. China has also begun building a railway linking Korla near existing oilfields in Xinjiang to Kashgar in the southern part of the region. The project calls for total investment of more than 6.0 billion yuan ($723 million), the Financial News said. "If the railway in southern Xinjiang could be opened, it would be good for the transport of our crude oil," the official said without giving further details. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)

GCAT	World Jewish Congress head Edgar Bronfman, who led the fight over unclaimed Jewish assets in Switzerland, was named on Wednesday to temporarily take a seat on the new Swiss Fund to aid Holocaust survivors. The executive board of the World Jewish Restitution Organisation (WJRO), which Bronfman also leads, made the decision after Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel resigned from the seven-member Fund board, citing statements "made in the Swiss press." Wiesel, who had also been named international chairman of the Fund, bowed out after Swiss officials said his additional title would carry no power. WJC sources said there had been difficulty finding a permanent replacement as many potential candidates felt Wiesel had been insulted. Four of the fund's members are named by the Swiss government and three by the WJRO, which is a branch of the WJC. WJC Executive Director Elan Steinberg said Bronfman would serve only on an interim basis until a permanent replacement was found. He said he expected that a replacement would be named at a WJRO meeting in Jerusalem on June 2. "Mr Bronfman was asked to serve now so that the fund can begin its work," he said. Jewish sources said several guidelines have been set for the $190 million Fund that was set up with donations from Swiss banks and industries after a spate of international cirticism over the Swiss role in the Second World War as bankers for the Third Reich. The sources said that about 500,000 survivors would be eligible for money from the fund and that need would be the prime criterion rather than extent of suffering. Germany has come under criticism from Jewish groups for basing some reparation payments on the length of time a survivor spent in a concentration camp or a ghetto.
ECAT	Strict fiscal discipline and tight monetary policy have contributed to the current slowing in Israel's economy, but the country's Finance Minister said the slowdown is thought to be only temporary. "The slowdown in the economy is evident," said Dan Meridor, Israel's Finance Minister.  But he added: "I do believe it is temporary." Speaking to an Israeli investment conference here, Meridor told investors that Israel's economic growth could be less than 4.0 percent in 1997 but he added that the country's growth prospects will be clearer in about two to three months.   Meridor said he hopes the rate of inflation for Israel will come in between 7.0 to 10 percent in 1997. Turning to the budget deficit, Meridor said: "We succeeded in cutting the budget deficit...setting the target in 1997, which will be around 2.8 percent of GDP." But the Finance Minister added, "We still fight every day to keep the budget in line." In the way of reforms, Meridor said the government is planning to move ahead with about 25 structural reforms.   Of those, he said the government is beginning the liberalization of the public transportation bus company.  "We are in the process of opening this monopoly to competition. We are doing it gradually but it is a major change." He also said the government is looking to do more in the way of privatizations. He said the government's Bank Leumi shares are up for sale and also added that El Al, the Israeli airline, needs to be sold. "We have liberalized a lot and are still in the process." In addition, Meridor said that there will be new public sector wage agreements in 1997.   "This year will be a year of new wage agreements in the public sector and these will have a dramatic effect if not conducted in the right way in coming years," he added. As for the Middle East peace process, Meridor said it is important to build economic cooperation, economic stability and economic prosperity with Israel's neighbors.

MCAT	Midwest direct cash hog prices Thursday were seen steady to $0.50 per cwt higher, supported by reduced hog marketings as producers continue to concentrate on harvesting, livestock dealers said. Clear weather in much of the Corn Belt was allowing ample opportunities for producers to get serious about harvesting. Top prices for Iowa and southern Minnesota hogs delivered at the plant could range from $58.50 to $59.00. Illinois buyers said top prices could range from $57.50 to $58.00 at the plant. Indiana and Ohio buyers said top prices at the plant could range from $58.00 to $58.50.   Interior Iowa/southern Minnesota actual marketings Tuesday totaled 101,000 head, below that day's estimate of 105,000, according to USDA. Wednesday's estimate was 100,000 head. The lighter marketings were reflected in USDA's lower hog slaughter estimate Wednesday of 348,000 head, compared with 367,000 a week ago. The week-to-date estimate was 1.074 million head, about 1.0 percent below a week ago, but 2.9 percent above a year ago. Support from the lighter supply was partly offset by weakening pork prices, with midday carlot pork prices showing declines in bellies and lean trimmings. --Bob Janis 312-408-8720--

GCAT	Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati on Friday urged European Union states not to jeopardise their interests in Iran over a German court's verdict that Tehran ordered political killings in Germany. "Our advice to Germany and other countries is not to tie their long-term political and economic interests in Iran, in this region and in the Islamic world to the remarks of an infamous judge of a local court," Velayati said. He was responding to a question about Iran's reaction to the EU's call for member states to withdraw their ambassadors from Tehran over the Berlin court ruling that Iranian leaders ordered the 1992 killings of four Kurdish dissidents in Germany. "They (EU states) should know that we are determined to answer any negative or positive moves swiftly and firmly," Velayati told Iranian state television. "They should not act unwisely and lose their balance over these controversies. Iran is watching the other states' actions carefully and...the future of ties with these countries will be determined by their attitude towards us," he said. Iran has repeatedly denied all involvement in the killings which it blames on infighting among opposition groups. Germany, one of Iran's main trade partners, withdrew its ambassador from Tehran and asked four Iranian diplomats to leave. Iran also recalled its ambassador and expelled four German diplomats. EU members, with the exception of Greece, recalled their envoys for consultations following Thursday's verdict. Switzerland said its ambassador to Iran was in Berne and would be kept there while it decides how to respond. The court decision forced the EU to abandon its controversial "critical dialogue" with Iran in a move which delighted the United States and other opponents of Tehran's Islamic government.
GCAT	Poland, anxious over events in Belarus, on Tuesday hastily prepared initiatives to support democracy and sovereignty in the neighbouring state where President Alexander Lukashenko was clashing with parliament. Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski said Warsaw was sounding out Ukraine and Lithuania on a possible joint statement by the three presidents. "We cannot regard what is going on in Belarus on the basis of saying "it's not happening in our house and it's none of our business'," PAP news agency quoted Kwasniewski as saying. He said the proposed statement would say that Belarus sovereignty was in Europe's interests and the three countries were ready to support everything that served democracy, the rule of law and the economic development of Belarus. Kwasniewski's spokesman Antoni Styrczula told Reuters the president had repeatedly written to Lukashenko, saying democratic reforms in Belarus should continue and human rights and media freedoms should be respected. The strongly pro-Russian Lukashenko, defying parliament and the constitutional court, has called a referendum on Sunday in a bid to increase his powers and extend his term by two years. Critics accuse him of dictatorial tendencies. After a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said the cabinet would support "all initiatives aimed at a conciliatory solution to disputes and conflicts." Warsaw politicians fear that political and economic instability in Belarus could complicate its NATO entry plans and harm its economic interests, and might even provoke a cross-border exodus of political dissidents seeking refuge. Poland hopes to join NATO soon, a goal strongly opposed by Lukashenko who echoes Russian arguments that the western defence alliance's eastward expansion could pose a threat to the former Soviet states. While opposition groups, including the Solidarity trade union have expressed strong support for Lukashenko's opponents, Polish authorities are keen to underline that they are not interfering in internal Belarus affairs. However parliament's foreign affairs committee proposed a resolution condemning any undemocratic moves that might menace the internal stability and sovereignty of Belarus. The lower house may vote on the draft on Wednesday.
CCAT	Australia's largest motoring organisation, the Sydney-based NRMA, said on Friday it was considering a plan to operate its own "superstore" used car yards which would remove haggling over prices and trade-ins. "It is wrong to suggest that this is an attack on car dealers," NRMA (National Roads and Motorists Association) chief executive Malcolm Jones said in a statement. "Buyers are already voting with their feet and over 50 percent of used car buyers currently choose to buy privately rather than from a dealer. These are the people we are looking at providing assistance to," Jones said.   NRMA, which provides roadside assistance services to stranded motorists as well as purchasing advice, said the superstore proposal was at the feasibility stage and the board was yet to make a final decision. NRMA is also a major general insurance operation. "NRMA is examining the feasibility of helping members to buy cars at a value for money price," Jones said. "A Superstore is a new trend emerging in the USA for buying vehicles as is using the Internet."   The proposal was strongly criticised by second hand car dealers quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, with one prominent dealer saying it would put 600 used car yards out of business. NRMA said a superstore would have touch-screen guides to buying a car, which would not be more than five years old, fixed prices with no bargaining, a fixed trade-in price and a return policy for unhappy customers. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
MCAT	Danish share prices opened slightly lower on Friday, with dealers unsure of the outlook but fearing further correction. "The consolidation of the past few days is expected to continue but it depends on foreign investors in the final analysis. The Dow ended up and that is positive but Danish shares could well have topped ahead of the first-half 1997 corporate result season," one dealer said.

ECAT	A bid by the Federal Reserve to stabilize the robust U.S. economic expansion is likely to involve only small interest rate adjustments, according to sources close to the central bank. The current low inflation rate allows for a "recalibration" rather than a radical change to monetary policy because volatility in the inflation rate declines when inflation is already low, one source told Reuters. Major swings in U.S. growth or inflation have triggered, in the past, protracted easing or tightening cycles.   Since it doubled the federal funds rate between February 1994 and February 1995, the Fed has moved on the overnight inter-bank lending rate only three times, lowering it to 5.25 percent in small, 25-basis-points increments. The source said a small "recalibration, or adjustment," of monetary policy showed the U.S. economy was more stable, in large part due to the absence of inflation swings. The Federal Open Market Committee next meets on March 25 to set the federal funds rate in an economic environment marked by rapid growth, tight labor markets, strong consumer spending and few price pressures.   The source stressed that the Fed is essentially concerned about incipient price pressures and the direction of underlying inflation, which has stopped heading lower. "Looking at the asymmetric directive the Fed had in place for some time now, this indicates the Fed thinks inflation this year would be somewhat where it was last year or a little higher," the source also said, referring to the tightening bias introduced by the central bank last July. "What justifies preemptive policy is that the cost in lowering inflation, once it picks up, would certainly be higher if you wait too long," the source noted.   "Policy must be preemptive, not reactive, to achieve price stability," the source said, explaining that an adjustment of the funds rate would mirror in scope the small easing moves made by the Fed between July 1995 and January 1996 to respond to a worrisome slowdown. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan described the last of those three moves -- which, with hindsight, appeared unnecessary -- as taking out "insurance." In his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony last month, Greenspan pointed out that one main difference between 1994 and 1997 was the level of the real, or inflation-adjusted, fed funds rate.   The real funds rate was close to zero and stimulative in 1994. In 1997, the real funds rate is at least 225 basis points, which Greenspan described as slightly restrictive and not particularly high by historic standards. A second source close to the Fed said the major concern at the Fed is the high level of growth which is running, on average, clearly above trend for the fifth straight quarter. "The (inflation) risks are on the upside given that the economy is still growing from already high levels of resource utilization," that source said. "Preemptive policy means the Fed does not have to slam on the brakes too hard."   The second source added that the economy seemed to have decelerated only slightly from its 3.9-percent pace recorded in the fourth quarter of 1996, despite the Fed's forecast for a slowdown in the second half of 1996. Gross Domestic Product rose 3.2 percent on a fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter basis in 1996, well above the 2.0- to 2.5-percent range often cited by Fed officials as the long-term potential growth rate. GDP growth in 1996 also represented a surge from 1.3 percent in 1995, and neared the 3.5-percent rate registered in 1994 when the Fed launched an aggressive preemptive tightening cycle.

ECAT	The Bank of Israel is expected to announce an interest rate cut of 0.3 to 0.5 percentage point from a rate of 14.7 percent, analysts said on Monday. The Bank of Israel is scheduled to announce its February monetary programme at 1430 GMT today. "My forecast was previously for an 0.3 point decrease based on the consumer price index," said Jonathan Katz, chief economist for Solid Financial Markets. "Now part of me is leaning towards 0.5 point because of the economic indicators released in recent days." Katz cited the drop in the "S" index of economic performance for November and December, lower industrial production and weak trade figures. "The whole trend in interest rates is now more downward than previously expected," he said. "You're now looking at negative growth, not just a slowdown." Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel also faces exchange rate pressures. The shekel has been strong and its currency-basket rate has been near the bottom of the trading band for more than a week, which has forced the Bank of Israel to intervene heavily in the local forex market and inject an estimated $500 million of liquidity into the economy. Eli Nahum, head of research at Zannex Securities, said the market was also looking for a cut of 0.3 to 0.5 point. But he and other analysts said the market is focused less on interest rates than on the unfolding government crisis, declining share prices on Wall Street and concerns that the market is overbought after a nearly uninterrupted rise in share prices since the start of November. Worries about an overbought situation were alleviated by a 3.61 percent plunge in the Mishtanim index of top 100 shares on Sunday. Today the index was up 1.22 percent to 234.75 points in midday trading. The government crisis, however, may continue to shadow the market, Nahum said. The crisis stems from allegations of high-level corruption in the appointment of an attorney-general earlier this month. On Sunday, Israeli police launched an investigation into the matter. Nahum said the affair has sparked worries that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government could fall. "I personally think that (is the reason for the market's nervousness), but a lot of players don't," he said. "Really, the market was looking for a reason to take profits." He said the market might be driven by interest rates if the central bank opted to hold rates or to cut them by more than 0.5 point. - David Rosenberg, Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
GCAT	American Steve Fossett was over the Sahara Desert on Friday, his expedition said, still drifting toward Libya and a possible end to his attempt to become the first to circle the globe nonstop in a balloon. At 7:30 a.m. EST (1230 GMT) his flight headquarters in Chicago said the 52-year-old commodities broker aboard the "Solo Spirit" was over north central Algeria high above the Sahara. His speed was down to 58 knots, considerably slower than the pace which sped him across the Atlantic in three days following his lift-off late on Monday night from St. Louis. Everything was going well with the flight, a spokesman said, except his route which continued to take him toward Libya, whose government has not yet granted permission to enter its airspace. The expedition has attempted to apply international pressure on Libya to say something one way or the other about using its airspace but so far there has been no word and Fossett may have to land rather than take a chance. He had hoped to skirt Libya by catching different winds at varying altitudes -- the only kind of control he has over the craft. But that apparently has not worked so far and the silver balloon was still headed for Libya, whose fractious relations with the United States have left the two countries without formal diplomatic ties. A chase plane sent out by the expedition had found Fossett and was keeping watch on him, a spokesman said. It was not known how soon he would reach the Libyan border but his trackers had estimated it might occur on Saturday. The dangers of entering foreign airspace were illustrated by two American balloonists who died in 1995. They were shot down by Belarus military who claimed they had no clearance to enter its air space. Organisers said they had been cleared. Fossett already holds the record for the longest solo manned balloon flight -- 5,435.8 miles (8,747 km) on a voyage from South Korea to Canada -- a mark that he would better on this voyage at some point over southeast Algeria, the expedition said. British tycoon Richard Branson and Swiss pilot Jean Piccard, who tried and failed in separate missions this month to capture the record Fossett is seeking, had said they would fly Branson's Citation, a small corporate jet, to circle the balloon as a welcome sometime after he passed Gibraltar but the expedtion said on Friday it did not know if that had happened. Branson was one of those who had been trying to intercede with the Libyan government to win Fossett permission to fly over the country. The expedition's Internet site carried an appeal for letters to President Bill Clinton to try to resolve the problem. Fossett's Internet site is http://www.luc.edu/solo. His pursuit of one of manned flight's oldest goals was forced to take a more southerly path than originally planned after he could not win permission from Russia to cross that country on a northern trans-European route. Language barriers in dealing with air traffic control and a number of other problems were involved. If the Libyan question is resolved Fossett hoped to cross Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, Mongolia, China again, perhaps Korea and then head out across the Pacific in a voyage that coule take as long as 18 days. He is riding in an unpressurized, oblong yellow capsule 6-1/2 by four foot (two by 1.3 metres) that is 5-1/2 feet (1.7 metres) high. He has been eating packaged prepared meals and has a small stove to prepare coffee. He has already gone much farther than the two rival expeditions which tried for the record in recent days. Piccard and Wim Verstraeten wound up in the Mediterranean on Sunday six hours after taking off from the Swiss Alps in pursuit of the record. Branson and two crew members brought their Virgin Global Challenger balloon down in Algeria last week less than a day after taking off from Morocco.
CCAT	General Motors Corp's Australian unit General-Motors Holden's Automotive Corp said on Friday it may have to upgrade up to 300,000 of its Commodore models after detecting potential transmission problems. Holden spokesman John Morrison told Reuters the company had issued a recall notice for 120,000 vehicles fitted with an automatic transmission and tow bar built since July 1993. However he said the company had also offered to upgrade another 180,000 vehicles without towbars, in the interests of any future towing use by the owner or subsequent owners.   "So we are actually doing more than we have to, extending the customer service...(but) the recall is very specifically directed at the 120,000 (vehicles) with towbars," he said. Morrison said the costs of the upgrade were significant, but the company was prepared to release specific figures. In its recall notice, Holden said it had received a small number of reports of transmission fluid leaking as a result of towing when the recommended transmission fluid cooling kit had not been fitted and/or recommended towing schedules were not followed. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
CCAT	Odakyu Electric Railway Co Ltd is considering issuing domestic straight bonds totalling some 40 billion yen, underwriting sources said on Wednesday. The private railway company was considering issuing some 20 billion yen worth of 10-year bonds and the same amount of 20-year bonds, they said. The company is likely to use such bond issues to finance capital investment and redemption of its convertible bonds which will mature early next year, they said. The company may decide on the terms of the bonds as early as next week, one underwriting source said. An Odakyu official confirmed that the company was mulling corporate bond issues but did not give further details.
GCAT	Only 20 percent of the world's major virgin forests remain, almost all of them in the far north of Russia and Canada and in Brazil's Amazon region, the World Resources Institute said on Tuesday. Most of the world's forests in other areas are unhealthy, threatened by logging and development, or too small and fragmented to sustain full biological systems, the environmental organisation said. Russia, Canada and Brazil contain most of the world's frontier forests that are large enough to provide havens for indigenous species and to survive indefinitely without human intervention if protections are put in place now, a study prepared by the group said. The WRI compiled the study by distributing satellite imagery to thousands of forest experts around the world, who assessed forests' health and threatening conditions, WRI president Jonathon Lash said at a briefing. The study also used climate data and other information to gauge the extent of forest cover 8,000 years ago, before human activity started to degrade forest lands. "It is an 8,000-year time-lapse snapshot of the human impact on forests," Lash said. The snapshot showed only three percent of frontier forests remain in the world's temperate regions, making those the most threatened kinds of forests, he said. All of North Africa and the Middle East and nearly all countries in Europe have lost all of their frontier forests, the study said. The continental United States has about 1 percent of its original forest cover, mainly in three combined park and wilderness areas in the northern Rockies and a block of the northern Cascades in Washington. "The question this report begs of society is when is enough enough? Humankind has so far destroyed about four-fifths of the world's natural forests. How much more can we afford to lose?" Nigel Sizer, a WRI associate, said at the briefing. Lash and Sizer said the study shows there still is time to save remaining forests, and cooperation is needed from a relatively small number of countries. "The critical point is that the countries whose forests are in good condition -- Canada, Russia, Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Guyana, Surinam, and French Guiana -- offer a tremendous opportunity for responsible forest management," Sizer said.

"I am pleased to report that current trading at all our companies is satisfactory," he said. Souter said Stagecoach had a stronger base for future development and a wide portfolio which gave access to a range of business opportunities. "I believe this strategy (of bus and rail business) will...help to balance any regulatory exposure in the future and make our future group development less susceptible to any single area of business risk," Souter said. Souter said Stagecoach was creating a UK bus management board to ensure continued focus on development of this business. -- London Newsroom +44 171 5427717
CCAT	Shares in glass-maker Saint-Gobain fell heavily on Tuesday, reflecting concerns over weak prices, analysts said after a company presentation . "There was a message of prudence for the 1997 year. I think that is having an effect and analyses are being revised downward, which is what I am doing," said a broker. Chairman Jean-Louis Beffa told analysts this morning that prices in Europe were weak and Saint-Gobain would find out in the second half whether the trend would continue. The shares were down 4.46 percent at 814 francs at 1423 GMT, while the market was down 3.07 percent.   There was a message that estimates for the current year should "take account of the effect of prices in Europe, which is tied to the fact that growth is not very strong," the analyst said. But it was possible Saint-Gobain could change its cautious outlook in the course of the year, he added. In any case there should be a catch-up in 1998 if weak prices held throughout this year, he said. A forecast 20 percent jump in profit for the 1997 year was tied to a one-off capital gain of 900 million francs on the sale of Cise to Bouygues. Another analyst said he was taking the comments on weak prices as a "profit warning". -- Pierre Tran, Paris newsroom +33 1 4221 5452 pnt

ECAT	A California legislative committee on Tuesday approved a plan to issue more than $511 million of bonds to build two state prisons. The state Assembly Committee on Public Safety voted 6-to-0 in favor of Assembly Bill 1264, which would authorize the state to build a 2,000-cell prison in Kern County and a 2,500-cell prison and processing center in San Diego. The bill will now advance to the Assembly Appropriations Committee, which could take it up as early as May 21.   The bill would make $249.8 million available for construction of the Kern County facility and $261.4 million available for the San Diego projects. The prisons would be funded with lease-purchase bonds, state officials said. The bill's author, Republican Assemblyman Charles Poochigian, said the new prisons were needed to ease overcrowding in state penal system, which currently holds 146,000 adult inmates. The prison population is expected to grow by an average of 10,500 inmates per year to 205,000 inmates by 2002.   Opponents of the prison proposal say lease-purchase bonds were more expensive for the state than general obligation bonds because lease-purchase bonds are not backed by the full taxing power of the state. Opponents also contend that lease-purchase bonds circumvent the state's voter requirements. General obligation bonds, unlike lease-purchase bonds, require voter approval. California's use of lease-purchase bonds has surged in recent years. Debt service on lease-purchase bonds has grown from 13 percent to 21 percent of total state debt service since 1991, according to a recent state report.
ECAT	The British Treasury's economic secretary, Angela Knight, said producer price figures on Monday signaled good news for consumer prices in the future. "Inflation at the factory gate is at its lowest for almost 30 years," Knight said in a statement read by a Treasury official. "Today's low inflation at the factory gate is tomorrow's good news for prices in the shops."   November producer output prices were unchanged from the prior month and were 2.1 percent higher than a year earlier. Seasonally adjusted input prices fell 3.2 percent in the month and were down 5.5 percent in the year. The input price fall was much deeper than expected, with markets looking for a 0.8 percent fall in the month and a 2.6 percent drop in the year. Economists on average expected a 0.1 percent November rise in output prices, with the range of forecasts running from flat to 0.3 percent higher. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 6784
MCAT	High cotton prices have triggered another special quota permitting entry of 44,900,528 kilograms (98,988,801 lbs), the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Thursday. The quota, being established on Feb 8, 1997, applies to cotton purchased not later than May 8, 1997 and entered into the United States not later than Aug 6, 1997, USDA said. The quota amount is for the period Sept 1996 through Nov 1996.
MCAT	Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly higher on Wednesday partly due to demand for funds before several new share issues and listings, traders said. The recent sharp decrease in funds on the repo market also contributed to Wednesday's rises, traders said. The annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract rose to 10.78 percent from 9.90 percent on Tuesday. Total turnover on the six-contract market fell slightly to 2.48 million lots from 2.53 million lots. One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.   Traders said major institutions borrowed heavily on the market to prepare for trading new shares, helping to push up the rates. One domestic A share firm is to start an offer and another is to list its shares on the Shanghai stock exchange in the next two days. A foreign currency B share firm is to list in Shanghai on Friday and an A share firm is to list in Shenzhen. Traders said liquidity had fallen in recent weeks after Beijing in June ordered state banks to pull out of state debt trading on the exchanges and in regional state debt trading centres.   "Major non-bank financial institutions, in particular securities houses, have been short of cash since state banks withdrew from the market," said one trader. "This has helped the repo rates to hold firm at high levels in the past few weeks," he said. But the weak performance of the stock markets on Wednesday prevented the rates from rising sharply, traders said. Traders said they believed the rates would move around the current high level in the short-term. Contracts on the T-bill spot market ended mixed, taking a break after weeks of rises saw yields fall sharply, they said.   The most actively traded 10-year bond that matures in June 2006, a market barometer, was at 112.40 yuan from 112.92 yuan. Combined volume on the eight-contract market rose sharply to 666,663 lots from 373,789 lots. Traders said they expected spot contracts to move narrowly around the current level in the next few days. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004
GCAT	Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek's Liberal Democratic Party (LDS) has extended its lead in the run-up to Slovenia's general election on November 10, according to two opinion polls published on Monday. Support for the centre-left LDS rose to 15.3 percent from 11.6 at the start of last week, the newspaper Delo said. A second poll conducted by another newspaper, Dnevnik, gave the LDS 21.8 percent, up from 15.8 percent. The LDS took a third of the votes in the last general elections in 1992. The rightist People's Party snatched second place from Social Democrats, headed by former defence minister Janez Jansa. Backing for the People's Party rose to 8.9 percent in the Delo poll and 9.9 percent in Dnevnik's survey from five and 5.5 percent respectively last week. The Social Democrats scored eight percent in both polls, up from seven and 7.5 percent. They are aiming to form the next government through a coalition with the People's Party. The Christian Democrats, currently in the coalition government with the LDS, gained 6.1 percent support in both newspapers. The United List of Social Democrats, the former communist party, registered 4.7 percent and 6.8 percent in the two surveys, little changed on last week. The number of undecided voters fell slightly to 33.9 and 38.1 percent from 36.8 to 39.3 percent.

ECAT	China's ballooning foreign reserves have not grown too large and the issue that needs attention is how to ensure the international balance of payments, a senior finance official said. The debate on whether the size of China's foreign reserves, which stood at $100.45 billion on November 12, was misinformed, the Business Weekly newspaper on Sunday quoted an unidentified official of the State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC) as saying. "What we should consider is not whether the reserves are too big or too small, but how to coordinate foreign exchange management with monetary policy in order to keep the balance of international payments and fulfil macro-economic targets," the newspaper quoted the official as saying. The central bank, the People's Bank of China, had never specified a target for the size of China's reserves, and these had been allowed to grow to ensure exchange rate stability, he said. The large size of the reserve was an unavoidable consequence of central bank currency operations as the bank had been forced to buy foreign currencies to balance supply and demand and to halt upward pressure on the domestic renminbi currency, he said. Since exports boomed in 1994, China's foreign exchange reserves had increased by 300 percent, the official said. There was no sign of a reduction in reserves in the short term because of weak import demand, partly as a result of a three-year-old tight monetary policy, he said. Even after the April 1 tariff cuts, China's foreign trade surplus had widened -- with officials expecting a $18 billion gap at the year end, he said. The official discounted inflationary pressure from the size of the reserves, saying the central bank had tried to offset the impact by recovery of relending, issue of bonds and launching repurchase of treasury bills. In the first three quarters of the year, 52.2 billion yuan ($6.3 billion) spent on buying foreign exchange was withdrawn from circulation through central bank operations, reducing the basic input of money to 144.9 billion yuan, he said. This move had been a factor in falling inflation this year despite the expansion of the reserves, he said. China's retail price inflation fell to a year-on-year 4.7 percent for October and officials have said they expect the figure to be about 6.3 percent for 1994 and to fall to around 6.0 percent next year. Retail price inflation rose 14.8 percent in 1995. However, the SAEC official warned that either a chronic surplus or deficit in the reserves could harm China's balance of payments.

MCAT	Fuel oil bunker prices in northwest Europe weakened on Monday while those in southern Europe were steady to soft, dealers said. Rotterdam 380 CST fuel oil was about $1 a tonne down, quoted at around $89/$90. Demand was very low, reducing the level of barge market business to a mere three deals. Total ARA demand was well under 10,000 tonnes according to many suppliers' estimates. Hamburg fuel oil bunkers were down, mainly in response to weakness in Rotterdam. However, the losses were limited by some problems with barge availability. In the Mediterranean, fuel oil bunkers were steady or $1 softer, while gas oil prices came off after last week's fall in benchmark cargo levels. -- Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 504 5000
CCAT	Creditor banks have extended emergency loans to two unlisted affiliates of South Korea's Jinro Group, an official at SEOULBANK said on Monday. The bank official said creditors granted Jinro Mass-Merchandising Inc 32.3 billion won and Jinro Construction 13.7 billion won on Saturday.   "The amount was same as the bail-out committee by financial institutions had decided," said the official. South Korean banks agreed on April 28 to provide 80.4 billion won in emergency loans to the troubled Jinro Group. But group chairman Chang Jin-ho was required to give banks authority to dispose of his family's shares of group units. So far, only those two companies have given a letter to their primary lenders authorising family share disposal. Creditors had different loan conditions. For example, the annual interest rate on loans extended by SEOULBANK was set at the bank's prime rate of 8.75 percent plus four percent. The loans would expire on July 27, as decided by the bail-out committee. -- Seoul Newsroom (822) 727 5647
GCAT	Syrian Vice-President Abdel Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara on Monday paid a short visit to Kuwait during which they met the Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah. Kuwaiti officials said the two Syrian officials, who arrived from Saudi Arabia where they had similar talks, delivered to the emir a message from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. They did not disclose the content of the message. The two officials left Kuwait after their short visit. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have close ties with Syria which fought alongside the U.S.-led mutlinational coalition which evicted Iraqi troops from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War.
MCAT	Most of the 2.0 billion stg of gilts snapped up at Wednesday's auction have gone to safe hands and the market can track the confident mood in international bond markets without fear of a stock overhang, analysts and dealers say. The market is also pricing in a couple more increases in Britain's 6.75 percent official interest rates so even the possibility of another tightening next month is unlikely to put more than a short-term dampener on sentiment, they add. The Bank of England's auction of the 8.0 percent 2021 bonds was oversubscribed with cover at 2.32 times the stock on offer and a yield tail of just one basis point. "We had the usual demand you'd expect for the long end  -- the pension funds and the insurers but there was also some international interest which took a few people by surprise," one gilt salesman at a UK market maker said. Earlier in the week, many players had been looking for cover of three times but this morning's surge in gilt prices of more than half a point at one stage may have persuaded some operators the market was looking slightly expensive. "The good part is the short tail, but the disappointing part is the cover. The market had broadly expected something significantly higher than 2.32. This could partly be explained by the fact that there has been a rally this morning and that might have put off some marginal bidders," said Andrew Davies, gilts analyst of London Bond Broking. September gilt futures set a series of new contract highs, toppling the previous best level of 115-5. The contract's highest price by 1230 GMT was 115-20. Comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan that the U.S. economy was slowing down and that inflation in 1997 would be quite modest sent international bond markets sharply higher. "This morning's rally is going to make additional gains hard from where we are now," said BZW bond economist Kevin Adams. But he argued that the market was likely to retain its firmer tone relative to other markets. The gilt/Bund spread narrowed to 156 basis points from 160 at Tuesday's close. "I think the spread against Germany is likely to remain pretty well underpinned. We could even see it come in further as some of the EMU stories start to come home to roost and people start to wonder exactly what sort of foundation EMU is going to have," he said. Fears that decisions on which countries are eligible for a entry for European Monetary Union will be taken on political not economic grounds is giving the UK which, has an opt out from EMU, the allure of a safe haven. Moreover, the UK market already has a tremendous amount of bearish news priced in -- witnessed by its resilience in the face of the unexpected strength of June retail sales data published today. June retail sales grew by an annual 5.4 percent, compared with expectations of just 4.5 percent, fuelling fears that the Bank of England will opt to increase Britain's 6.75 percent interest rates at the August 6-7 monetary meeting - the fourth monthly increase in succession. Adams argues the Bank will hold off a little longer because although sales are undoubtedly strong, consumers remain resistant to price increases which should keep the lid on inflation. "Even when rates do go up, that will be seen as very pre-emptive and won't have much impact very far out along the (UK yield) curve. It will simply drag the inversion shorter." The market will be looking for further clues on the timing of any further rise in UK rates in this afternoon's testimony from central Bank Governor Eddie George to a parliamentary committee at 1515 GMT. HSBC economist Jonathan Loynes said the gilt market could be under-estimating the probable strength of UK data over the next few months and 10-year yields could move back above seven percent and perhaps even to 7.25, compared with 6.94 now. "The market seems to have changed tack over the last week or so and seems to have started worrying more about the long-term outlook than the here and now. The "r" word (recession) has even popped up. Several bits of strong data over the next few months could bring us back to earth," he said. "But we're still pretty optimistic by the end of the year -- we're looking for yields of about 6.75 percent but the market might have a bit of a tricky patch to get through first," he said. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109
GCAT	Palestinian Minister of Planning Nabil Shaath said in an interview published on Friday that the Middle East could "explode" if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not implement peace agreements. Shaath also told the London-based al-Hayat daily that Arab pressure on Israel, including the threat of withholding diplomatic and trade ties, was an important way of directing Netanyahu towards fulfilling the promises of his predecessors. Asked if the Middle East could stand four years of a Likud government that dragged its feet on peace, Shaath said: "The region will explode in his (Netanyahu's) face from all sides because it can't wait four years and he can't continue for four years to reject the peace process. "This is impossible for the Palestinians, Arabs, Israelis and the international community. The region cannot stand it," said Shaath, who was interviewed in Istanbul where he was attending an economic conference. Israel and the PLO on Friday adjourned until Monday talks on implementing a long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron, negotiators said. Netanyahu, elected in May, put the signed deal on hold, saying changes were needed to enhance security for some 400 Jewish settlers living amid 100,000 Palestinians in Hebron. The right-wing prime minister has dismayed Arabs with his rejection of the principle of trading land for peace and of the idea of a Palestinian state. Arab states, including Israel's only peace partners Egypt and Jordan, hinted at a summit meeting in Cairo in June they could review moves towards normal relations with the Jewish state if it did not make progress in peace talks.
GCAT	Long reviled by British holidaymakers for grabbing the best places in the Mediterranean sun, the Germans have now taken the war to the enemy by refusing to budge from a beach in England. A group of German evangelists called the Society for Understanding has failed to live up to its name and is sitting tight on Loe Bar beach in Cornwall, southwestern England, according to news reports on Friday. The group, up to 80 strong, has ignored attempts by police and Loe Bar's owners, the National Trust heritage charity, to have them evicted. The group will only communicate with the authorities by quoting from the Bible in German, according to the Daily Telegraph, although one of them told BBC television, in English, that the beach was "a nice place". Another group spokesman praised the "spirituality" of the location. A 24-vehicle convoy of cars, vans and mobile homes first drove on to the beach two weeks ago. They left peacefully after police threatened to evict them from private property. National Trust workers blocked access to Loe Bar with boulders and a trench, but this proved no match for the Germans, who shifted the boulders and filled in the trench. Scuffles ensued and six people were arrested. The affair has alarmed law-abiding Germans visiting the area, which is a popular holiday destination. "We are very embarrassed, us and our country," one German woman told BBC television.
ECAT	President Clinton on Friday hailed the news that the U.S. jobless rate had dropped as evidence that his economic strategy was working. "Today, we received one more piece of solid evidence that this invest-and-grow strategy is working," he said in a written statement after the Labor Department said the jobless rate fell in May to its lowest level in more than 23 years. "America's economy is the strongest it has been in a generation," he said.   Clinton said the balanced-budget blueprint he had reached with Congress embodied his strategy for economic growth. He welcomed what he called Congress' "strong endorsement" of the plan on Thursday. The House of Representatives and the Senate put the final stamp of approval on an agreement to balance the U.S. budget by 2002. It serves as a blueprint for spending and tax legislation which will be crafted this summer and will need Clinton's approval to become law. "This bipartisan action is a hopeful sign that both parties can work together to keep our economy growing," Clinton said. "I look forward to working with leaders of both parties to write our balanced budget plan into law." Clinton repeated his vow to veto a disaster relief bill because of what he called "unacceptable political items" attached to the legislation by Republican leaders. "I have no choice but to veto that measure," he said. "Unfortunately, the Republican leaders of Congress have chosen the path of partisanship and confrontation in their actions on the disaster relief bill," he said. He urged Congress to pass "straightforward disaster relief legislation" for him to sign.
GCAT	Bulgaria's foreign ministry said on Wednesday the NATO-Russia security pact opens the way for partnership in Europe and may boost chances of this Balkan country to join NATO. "This historic accord, which formally ends the era of confrontation in Europe and clears the way for the alliance to expand eastwards, gives us grounds to reaffirm Bulgaria's strong desire to join NATO," Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaikov told a news conference. NATO leaders and Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed on Tuesday the Founding Act on Mutual Relations desgined to bind Russia into efforts to create a new European security order. "We praise the Russia-NATO accord which ends an era of confrontation in Europe and reaffirms the rignt of each country to decide how to guarantee its security," said Vlaikov. He said the accord, which abolishes the division lines created in Yalta, has increased the hopes of Bulgaria that its active and clear policy towards NATO will be considered. In mid February Bulgaria's caretaker government adopted a declaration stating a desire for a full NATO membership in a move to clear the so far ambiguous policy on the issue of the country's former Socialist rulers. Bulgaria's Union of Democratic Forces, which won the April general election and formed a cabinet last week, has set the country's NATO membership as a main foreign policy priority. NATO is expected to issue the first invitations to prospective new members at a summit in Madrid in July and Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are considered the most likely candidates to join in the first wave of enlargement.

GCAT	A bomb exploded in Nigeria's biggest city Lagos early on Wednesday, critically wounding 12 soldiers and raising the prospects of a violent Christmas in the politically troubled African nation. Witnesses said a bus carrying about 60 soldiers was ripped apart by a bomb planted in a refuse dump nearby. It was the third bomb blast in Lagos in a month. "No one is dead but 12 soldiers are critically injured and are in hospital," said an official of Lagos state government. "Some civilians have also been injured but not seriously," he said. Residents of Lagos, the bastion of opposition to Nigeria's military government, said they feared the spate of bomb attacks could lead to a violent Christmas season. Lagos state military administrator Colonel Muhammed Marwa survived a bomb attack on Monday and three people died in a car bomb explosion last month. "Everyone is afraid because we don't know when or where the next attack will be," said estate agent Christopher Njoku. On Tuesday, the U.S. state department said it had received information that bomb attacks might take place at Nigerian airports during the last two weeks of December and warned Americans travelling to the country to be cautious. Many people have condemned the attack on Marwa, who has been popular in Lagos for repairing the city's potholed roads. So far no one has claimed responsibility for the recent wave of bomb blasts in Nigeria but police say the explosion in November was the handiwork of the exiled opposition. It said the attack on Marwa, a close aide of military ruler General Sani Abacha, had a striking resemblance to the November incident that killed three people, including the head of the airport security, in a bungled car bomb explosion. Police said the victims were agents of exiled opposition leader and Nobel prize winner for literature Wole Soyinka. Soyinka leads a group based abroad known as the National Liberation Council of Nigeria (NALICON) which has vowed to topple Abacha. NALICON is allied to the umbrella opposition group, the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO). Last week the military administrator of the southwestern Ondo state, Navy Commander Anthony Onyearugbulem, visited NADECO's 88-year-old leader Michael Ajasin in his home in Owo and tongue-lashed him for holding meetings of opponents of the military government in his home. "At your age, what kind of society do you want to leave behind?" Onyearugbulem asked Ajasin. Opposition sources said the government, smarting from the bombing incidents, could resume its crackdown on opponents. Many people are already in detention in Nigeria, among them Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of a 1993 presidential poll whose annulment plunged the country into crisis. Abacha seized power in the chaos that ensued and has pledged to hand over to a democratically elected president in 1998 but his critics say his agenda is to hang on to power. Nigeria is treated as a pariah over its human rights record and last year's hanging on murder charges of nine minority rights activists including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, which caused its suspension from the Commonwealth.
ECAT	Ministers from 34 nations in the Americas started a meeting in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte on Friday facing a north-south divide on how to spread free trade throughout the region. Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia, presiding over the opening session, reaffirmed his country's desire to advance with caution and care in setting up the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). "We are not engaged here in some exercise of rhetoric that will lead us to a declaration of principles of a merely symbolic or exhortative value," Lampreia said. "We are engaged in what might very well prove to be the greatest initiative of commercial diplomacy of the majority of our countries in the coming years," he said. The FTAA was launched at the Miami summit in 1994 and envisaged a free trade zone stretching from the Bering Strait to the plains of Patagonia after the year 2005. With a combined gross domestic product in excess of $9.0 trillion and almost one billion consumers, the FTAA would be the biggest free trade area in the world. Lower-level talks this week in Belo Horizonte to prepare for Friday's ministerial get-together failed to reach consensus on how to launch formal trade negotiations, officials said. All would like to start the talks after a presidential FTAA summit in Chile next March. But South America's Mercosur trade bloc of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay wants to proceed with care, negotiating in stages, with tariff cuts left until last. The United States, on the other hand, is pushing for speed, and wants to discuss everything from tariff reductions to subsidies at the same time. "What is going on is a war of equilibrium (between the United States and Mercosur)," said Stefan Bogdan Salej, president of the Minas Gerais industry federation FIEMG. Salej said the struggle for influence between Washington and Brasilia, which is acting as spokesman for its Mercosur partners, partly reflected a growing awareness in South America of the importance of trade with the European Union. "American business still treats us in a neo-colonialist way. The Europeans treat us differently," he told Reuters. In debating a draft ministerial declaration, made available to Reuters, the ministers will have to decide whether they "will" or "should" launch formal talks next March. The ministers will also have to decide whether to allow the labour movement a greater advisory role in the negotiating process. Business leaders already hold official parallel forums to FTAA meetings. Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso warned on Thursday night that the FTAA would only be possible if it brought clear social benefits. Foreign Minister Lampreia on Friday distributed to his counterparts a "Manifesto of the Workers of the Americas," drafted earlier in the week by trade unionists meeting in Belo Horizonte and which demands worker's rights be safeguarded.
GCAT	Gunmen killed two policemen and wounded two others and a patient at a hospital in Karachi on Monday before escaping with a prisoner under treatment, police said. At least three gunmen were involved in the early morning attack on the government's civil hospital in a busy district of the city. Police identified the escaped prisoner as Asghar Shah, an activist of the Sindhi nationalist Jiye Sindh party who was serving a 25-year jail term. Separately, police said the bullet-riddled body of a 30-year-old activist of the ethnic Mohajir National Movement (MQM) had been found in a sack in another part of the city on Sunday. No group has claimed responsibility for the death of the MQM party worker, whose body bore marks of torture. Violence between the MQM and a splinter MQM-Haqiqi faction has risen since national and provincial elections on February 3. After the polls, the MQM, led by London-based Altaf Hussain, joined with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League to form a coalition government in Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital. Over 800 people were killed in ethnic, political and sectarian strife in the southern port city last year following more than 2,000 in 1995.
MCAT	Blue-chip stocks closed weaker Tuesday as the market retreated again after a strong rebound from an early sell-off. Based on early, unofficial results, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 22.75 points to close at 7,312.15. But in the broader market, advancing issues led declines by a 14-10 margin on active volume of about 530 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The Nasdaq composite index fell 19.90 points to 1,384.89.
MCAT	U.S. stock index futures finished lower, still pressured by profit taking on recent gains and weak technology stocks. December Standard and Poor's 500 futures slipped thorugh support at 710.00 to hit a session nadir of 708.30, the lowest price in a week. Traders said the market had become ripe for a correction after December pushed to an all-time high at 718.70 Monday and then closed lower. "We had a big push up on Friday and on Monday we had higher highs and we just couldn't hold it," a trader said.   Traders called activity light early in the day, but said interest picked up on the afternoon decline. Chicago Mercantile Exchange estimated overall S&P 500 futures volume Tuesday at 79,000 contracts. "We're in a little corrective phase, but I really don't see a lot to it," another S&P 500 futures trader said. He said a band of resistance from 705.00 to 706.00 should keep a floor under the market, if indeed Tuesday's weakness was a correction. He cited some fund selling on the decline, and said locals had been active.   Some traders said Tuesday's declines were a welcome sign after Monday's run to new highs. They said mild losses pave the way for the uptrend to resume. "I think that depending on where we open tomorrow this might be a bear trap," another S&P 500 futures trader said. "There're a lot of new shorts between 710.50 and 708.50 and I think those are really vulnerable if we go up to the 710.50 level tomorrow," he said. Also, once Treasury's five-year note auction is out of the way, Treasury bonds could lead stocks higher, some traders said.   December S&Ps finished down 5.30 points at 709.10, new composites were off 2.70 at 377.20, KBT value lines were 4.10 points lower at 647.50, Nikkei 225s fell 20.0 at 21,175, and Nasdaq 100s eased 11.00 at 741.75. -Derivatives desk 312-408-8750;E-mail derivatives@reuters.com

CCAT	California's three investor-owned utilities have asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to convene a technical workshop on market power issues raised by deregulation of the industry. An initial workshop was held Jan 17, but the utilities feel they need more guidance, especially on contracts governing "must-run" generating units. The utilities are Edison International's Southern California Edison Co, PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric Co and Enova Corp's San Diego Gas & Electric Co. They have been directed to have filings ready for FERC by March 31, and are seeking a second technical workshop for Feb 10. The primary reason for the workshop is to examine ways to minimize the market power of generating units which will have to run to maintain reliability in certain regions, an Edison spokeswoman said. Edison, which plans to sell off all of its fossil-fuel power plants, proposes establishing "call contracts" which would allow the independent system operator to order "must run" units to sell power into the power exchange at cost, said spokeswoman Gloria Quinn. "When we do the filing on March 31, we want to make sure FERC has what they need to get approval (for the independent system operator/power exchange) in time for their launch next Janaury," she added. An independent system operator will be responsible under California law for operating the interconnected transmission system. --D Beasley, Los Angeles bureau 213-955-6761
CCAT	A Canadian company said on Monday it agreed with India's Vatsa Corp. Ltd. to develop an ocean theme park near Bombay. SeaParks Entertainment & Attractions Corp. of Vancouver signed a memorandum of understanding with a Vatsa subsidiary. The partners envision building several sites in India at a cost of about $75 million each, SeaParks Chief Executive Bruce Fuller said. The theme park would be designed around the concept of undersea exploration and combine environmental education, water rides and wildlife displays. While details of the agreement with Vatsa had not yet been finalised, the Bombay park would take about two years to build once arrangements were completed, Fuller said. SeaParks is also negotiating joint ventures to build parks in South Korea and Japan. The private company, founded in 1991, has not yet built a park based on its concept. Asia is the target market for the parks because of its strong economic growth and rapidly expanding middle class. "We know tourism and the middle class are booming in India," Fuller said. He said Vatsa was developing an $800 million theme park near Bombay. The SeaParks project would not be part of that development.
GCAT	It is a hot, steamy Asian night and a young girl waits seductively in the doorway. The image is commonly found in leaflets selling sex tours in third world countries. The other half of that image appears in court. Last month, 44-year-old Steven Roy Mitchell of Walton-on-Thames, England was pictured in newspapers clasping a Bible as he went to jail for 17 years. Mitchell was convicted by a Manila court of having sex with two brothers, aged eight and four. Mitchell's conviction is one of a couple of recent cases that have stunned the Philippines' sex industry, which thrived by telling customers there was no fear of reprisals. "May this decision be a warning to all foreign tourists who come to the Philippines that this country can no longer be made their 'playground' for illegal activities, like paedophilia and child abuse," the judgement on the Mitchell case said. The government's recent crackdown against paedophiles has gained international support, with London's Scotland Yard sending two experts to train the Philippine police. The two-week course held last month taught detectives how to investigate a case in a way that would secure a conviction. "I investigated no less than 50 cases (of paedophilia) since 1982 of which only 10 went to court, and they are all pending there," said Mamerto Espartero, the Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation's senior agent for Metro Manila. Espartero, who took part in the Scotland Yard course, said that until recently most paedophilia cases got bogged down because the evidence was insufficient. "Often child victims do not want to testify because usually the violators are relatives or neighbours," he said. Poverty, the reason why many children turn to prostitution, also hampers investigation as often parents are paid for their silence, he said. The new drive against paedophiles is bringing various government departments together. At the Scotland Yard course, detectives trained along with prosecutors, immigration officials and doctors. "Working together like this is going to be our biggest advantage in our fight against paedophiles," said Bernadette Madrid, head of the Child Protection Unit at the Philippine General Hospital. A joint effort would mean doctors providing crucial evidence like X-rays of damage to the genitals. Prosecutors would advise police on flaws in the evidence-building and immigration officials would watch for offenders trying to run away. Mitchell's imprisonment was the second case involving a foreigner convicted of a paedophilia crime in the Philippines. In May, Australian businessman Keith Fitzgerald was jailed for up to 17 years for paying a 12-year-old girl to have sex with him. "(But) you must not just be looking for the paedophile being a foreigner," was the advice given by detective Sharon Stimpson, one of the trainers at the course. "It could be people who are living here who are in positions of trust. The best way of combating it is to believe what the child says even if it's somebody very surprising who the finger is being pointed at," she said. Stimpson said the Philippines' drive against sexual abuse of children would mean law enforcement would get "proactive," that they would go out and look for paedophiles rather than wait for victims to come and complain. Philippine police say an active hunt for child abusers is definitely on the cards now that the government has approved the formation of a special cell to fight paedophiles. If that happens, the results could be surprising. End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism (ECPAT), an organisation fighting paedophilia, says the crime is more widespread than is known. It has published a book that says the popular image of a child sex abuser as a nasty character is far from the mark. "Most long-term, persistently offending paedophiles are men who have been regarded as model citizens, somewhat conservative in their dress, their religion and their politics," it said.
ECAT	China has taken a bold move to reduce political influence in setting money supply by creating a special policy body modelled after the U.S. Federal Reserve, analysts said on Monday. The new group, which held its first meeting last week, is only an advisory body but it is headed by the central bank chief and is vaguely patterned after the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which determines U.S. interest rate levels. "This is a very positive step," said Chen Xingdong, chief economist (China) at Peregrine Brokerage Ltd in Beijing. "This will make the setting of monetary policy more stable." Monetary policy in China is highly politicised and is ultimately determined by the State Council (cabinet) with competing factions and regional interests exerting political leverage, often obstructing the views of the central bank, or People's Bank of China. The banking system has been the lifeblood of many money-losing state enterprises, which wield considerable clout due to their role as major employers and vital components in maintaining social order. They have traditionally pushed for policy loans to keep them afloat and easier monetary policies to reduce their heavy debt burden. In the past, the central bank made its own policy recommendations but competing interests would plead their case with the State Council. "That's where the disputes would be," said Chen. With the new body, known as the monetary policy committee of the People's Bank of China, monetary policy would be debated at a technical level and then a recommendation would be drafted for the State Council to review. "This body will be much like the Federal Open Market Committee," said an official at the China Everbright Bank, who declined to be identified by name. "This will mean the nation's monetary policy will be determined more on the basis of supply and demand for credit," he said. The body, which will hold quarterly meetings, will be headed by central bank governor Dai Xianglong and vice governor Chen Yuan will act as deputy. Its members include deputy director of the State Planning Commission Wang Chunzheng as well as senior officials of the State Economic and Trade Commission, the finance ministry, the securities watchdog the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the foreign exchange regulatory body, the heads of two of the nation's top commercial banks and a renowned academic. At its first meeting, the policy committee agreed to continue the central bank's "appropriately tight" monetary policies, the official China Daily said on Saturday. "This is an advisory body," said Wu Xiaoqiu, director of the department of finance and securities at People's University, an academic institute in Beijing. "But it will ensure medium and long term interests are considered in the setting of monetary policy."
CCAT	Westpac Banking Corp on Thursday unveiled an audacious A$1.435 billion bid for the much-smaller Bank of Melbourne Ltd, confident it would win the support of regulators and the national government. The friendly bid had been mooted by market speculators the previous day when shares in Bank of Melbourne, a regional bank with a strong mortgage loan book, jumped sharply.   Sydney-based Westpac, one of the four largest in Australia, has been interested in Bank of Melbourne, based in the state of Victoria, for about 18 months but had been told then by anti-monopoly regulators that a bid would not succeed. "Our regional banking approach will ensure Bank of Melbourne becomes a stronger competitive force in Victoria and retains its local identity," Westpac managing director Bob Joss told reporters, making his case for approval.   Australian Treasurer Peter Costello was non-committal about the bid, saying Westpac's move was a risky one as it came ahead of the release of recommendations from the Wallis inquiry into Australia's financial system. The inquiry's report was expected to support further takeovers by the big four banks of smaller rivals and other finance groups. With A$121.5 billion of assets, Westpac towered over Bank of Melbourne which had only A$9.2 billion of assets but has its sights set on the target bank's nine percent share of the Victorian market, about the same as Westpac now has.   Analysts said Westpac's move would also help shore up its defences against a possible bid by the biggest local bank, National Australia Bank Ltd, which is also based in Melbourne. "Obviously it would make Westpac somewhat less of a takeover target. To the extent that Westpac is less of a takover target (fellow major bank) ANZ becomes somewhat more of a takeover target," said ABN AMRO analyst Michael Pulman. Bank of Melbourne chairman Chris Stewart said the bank's shareholders should support the takeover bid which values each share at A$9.75.   "I'm absolutely in favour of this merger...it's extremely good for the shareholders who will receive a very fair price," Stewart said. Investors applauded the bid, sending shares in Bank of Melbourne seven percent higher to A$9.50 and nudging Westpac up one cent to A$6.88. Bank of Melbourne shares soared 65 cents on Wednesday before trading was halted. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the nation's anti-monopolies watchdog, said it would scrutinise the bid.   It has previously said it would not approve a merger that left a state market without at least one strong regional bank. ACCC chairman Allan Fels told Reuters that he warned Westpac two years ago the regulator would be hesitant to sanction a takeover of Bank of Melbourne. But he said he had a "neutral attitude" about Westpac's latest move. Analysts said the ACCC would face pressure to approve the bid from others in the finance industry who were also itching to go on the acquisition trail once the Wallis inquiry's report had been released and most likely adopted by the government.   -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
GCAT	Ajax Amsterdam's Brazilian international defender Santos set a new Dutch record on Sunday when he was sent off only 17 seconds after coming on as a second-half substitute. Without kicking a ball, Santos was called into action moments after replacing injured defender Mario Melchiot, hauling back PSV Eindhoven's Belgian striker Luc Nilis and receiving his marching orders from referee Dick Jol. The previous record was 28 seconds when Ton Rietbroek of Dordrecht 90 was dismissed against NEC on October 7, 1990. Santos, an accomplished defender with a good disciplinary record, was sent off last week while playing for Ajax reserves. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
CCAT	Construction company Engil-SGPS is expected to report a consolidated net profit of 600 to 650 million escudos ($4.0-4.3 million) in the first half, flat on last year but below initial forecasts, analysts said. But they said that the company, which is expected to announce six month figures within a few days, was still on target to reach a full-year profit of 1.5 billion escudos, compared with 1.18 billion in 1995. "I am looking for close to 650 (million escudos), below the 750 million that were being forecast at the start of the year," said Pedro Andrada of brokers Fincor. First half profit in 1995 was 586 billion escudos. But Andrada said the company could still reach the 1.5 billion profit target for the whole year. "The 1.5 billion seems reasonable...because the second half is usually better," added Joao Pereira of Gesfinc. "We have been recommending it as a buy for some time," he said. The construction sector got off to a slow start in 1996 because of heavy winter rains and the fact that the 1996 budget only came into effect in April because of the change of government at the end of the previous year. Most analysts expect that the construction sector will outperform the overall economy in 1996 and from the stock market perspective Engil had the advantage of being one of the most liquid construction stocks. It is quoted on Wall Street as American Depositary Receipts (ADR). ($1=152.4 escudos) ---Sergio Goncalves, Lisbon bureau 3511-3150035
CCAT	Kmart Corp. is introducing a Kmart Cash Card later this month that will replace gift certificates and some cash refunds, and can also be used as an AT&T Corp. calling card. While other retailers offer the so-called stored-value cards for some transactions, Troy, Mich.-based Kmart is believed to be the first mass retailer to offer a card for so many different transactions, said Tom Recktenwald, an executive vice president at Louisville, Ky.-based Stored Value Systems, which is administering the card programme for Kmart. Kmart will use the cards, which can store any amount of cash value, to replace of gift certificates. For returns made without a receipt, the store can enter credit into the cards instead of giving customers cash. When a customer uses the card, it is swiped through a Kmart cash register, like a credit card or debit card with a magnetic stripe. The card is "read" and the value of the purchase is deducted. A customer may "re-load" the card at any Kmart register. Aside from making shopping easier for some customers, Kmart also expects the cards to save the retailer money in terms of paperwork, while also minimising abuses in its cash refund process, said Robert Burton, Kmart chief finacial officer. "We're doing this because we think this saves us dollars, in addition to providing a benefit to the customer," Burton said. Kmart's stock fell 44 cents to $11.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
ECAT	Shanghai's industrial output value increased by a year-on-year 13.5 percent to 1.192 billion yuan in the first quarter of the year, the Business news said on Sunday. Industrial sales turnover rose by a year-on-year 11.4 percent to 1.149 billion yuan, the newspaper said but gave no details.
ECAT	Ministers from 128 countries gathered in Singapore on Sunday for a week-long conference aimed at agreeing an agenda to push the world towards global free trade in the 21st century. But they hold widely differing views on the next steps they need to take to get there and on how to tackle the social and political problems thrown up by the growing integration of the international economy. The gathering in this booming Asian city-state is the first Ministerial Conference of the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation (WTO), launched two years ago to replace the 47-year-old old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero says he is sure the meeting will give a major boost to a wider opening of world markets. The Ministerial is also being attended by officials from 28 other states including China and Russia waiting to enter the organisation, which has just admitted three new members to bring the total to 128. In a letter to Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong who will chair the gathering, the WTO's supreme authority, Ruggiero said Geneva negotiations on a declaration to be issued by the ministers provided a "solid base" for accord. And he has made clear he hopes to see firm movement in private ministerial talks towards multi-billion dollar pacts on freeing trade within the next few years in information technology products and basic telecommunications. But he acknowledged there were difficult decisions to be taken on how to handle controversial "new issues" -- like trade and labour, investment, competition policy and government procurement -- at the heart of much North-South friction. "I am confident that the Declaration that will emerge will be one in which all WTO members can take pride and...can reaffirm their commitment to the great shared undertaking that is the multilateral trading system," Ruggiero's letter said. The declaration is to be issued next Friday and will be a key text guiding the WTO, created by international treaty at the end of the ground-breaking 1986-93 Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations, towards the new century. The big trading powers -- the United States, the European Union, Japan and Canada -- have varying views on what should be in it. But key developing countries, especially in Asia, are determined to keep the "new issues" out. The United States, with some EU support, wants the WTO to start discussing whether its rules should be adjusted to take account of the trading advantage some poorer countries gain from exploiting an unprotected, low-wage labour force. They say the aim is to ensure that "core labour standards" -- including the freedom to set up worker unions and a ban on children in the workplace -- are observed throughout the world. U.S. and EU officials on Sunday told a Singapore meeting of a major global labour union body, the Brussels-based ICFTU, that unless the WTO could be shown to be addressing the question, public support in the West for free trade would evaporate. The ICFTU, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, reflecting Western workers' fears that open markets mean jobs are slipping away to poorer countries, in turn issued a warning that the WTO's credibility was at stake. But representatives of Asian-based development groups at another WTO-linked meeting in Singapore argued that the West -- both workers and governments -- was primarily interested in keeping out cheaper goods from developing countries. Ruggiero himself told the ICFTU meeting he believed common ground could be found on the labour issue. Another controversy at the WTO gathering is expected to swirl around agriculture and how quickly to push ahead with a new round of talks on freeing trade in farm products set in the Uruguay Round to start by the end of the century. Key agricultural producers ranging from Argentina and Australia to Thailand and Uruguay want wording in the declaration allowing for preparations to start soon. But this is resisted by Japan and South Korea -- whose governments faced fierce criticism when they had to slightly open their long-protected rice markets at the end of the Uruguay Round -- and from the EU whose farmers also fear more open markets.

MCAT	Gold bugs head into 1997 gripped by the fear that European central banks will dump big chunks of their reserves to raise money to plug budget holes and qualify for Europe's single currency project. So while many analysts think gold has found solid ground around $365 an ounce and should move in a relatively narrow range next year, they say the future depends largely on whether dust-covered official reserves come pouring on to the market. "The uncertainty surrounding central banks is a cloud that will remain over the gold market for the next 12 months," said Kevin Crisp, a metals analyst at J.P. Morgan in London who sees gold moving in a range of $350 to $400 in 1997. "I think 1997 could actually be quite a critical year for the gold market," he said. "There are some key issues that still need to be properly addressed. In 1997 we could possibly see some clarification of central banks' relationship with gold." Rumours of official gold sales weighed heavily on prices in 1996, when prices above $400 early in the year would not hold, but the secretive nature of central banks kept many traders guessing about the true extent of transactions. ROLLERCOASTER MARKET COULD EMERGE "We are almost certain that there is at least one central bank in the market selling now," said Ted Arnold at Merrill Lynch in London. "But we expect to see more European central bank selling in 1997 as governments rush to try to meet their European Union monetary commitments." Countries trying to be founding members of the single euro currency in 1999 must cap their budget deficits at three percent of gross domestic product in 1997, the deadline for qualifying for the first wave of economic and monetary union (EMU). Arnold saw gold dropping as low as $330 next year in volatile trading that could include days of panic selling. "We are hoping that rising central bank sales during 1997 coupled with producer and bullion house selling will continue to erode the gold price away," he said. "This steady price erosion should be reinforced by more and more fund selling as the technicals increasingly turn bearish," he added, but suggested a sharp plunge would trigger fresh buying that could catapult gold back toward $390. UNDERLYING DEMAND SEEN AS STRONG Not all analysts are convinced that central banks will be big sellers, or even sell into the market if they sell at all. "There are fears that central banks will sell before EMU. I tend not to believe this because the time horizon is so short. They could not because the ounce price would collapse," said Donald Feliser at CS Research in Zurich. He said banks that do sell would probably do business with other central banks so supplies do not hit the open market. Germany, Austria and Switzerland will also keep teaming up to prevent the International Monetary Fund from selling gold reserves, at least for the time being, he added. "If you remove these two negative factors, there remains robust demand, which really is robust," he said, citing southeast Asia as a growing market for gold. He was cautiously optimistic gold would stay between $365 and $390 in 1997. "I think the discussion about sales by central banks will play less of a role next year and I can imagine we will move in a range between $370 and $395," said Hanspeter Hausherr at SBC Warburg in Zurich. "I would not completely rule out a sudden movement -- up or down -- as we saw in January and February this year, but if you look at the year as a whole than I think we will see a range similar to what we had this year." GOOD GROWTH, LOW INFLATION BAD FOR GOLD Fundamentally, the supply of gold should not cover demand in 1997, analysts say, but mine output is slowly rising and key consumers, especially in Asia, are not showing the appetite they once did. Scrap recycling could also cut demand for new gold. "If 1996 was a year of consolidation after record-breaking levels of fabrication demand in 1995, then next year hopefully we'll be back to a reasonable level of growth again, but it may be a little slower than in the past," Crisp said. He and other analysts said gold could also get a boost if stock markets cool off and encourage a shift of funds from equities into other assets. That at least would lend some lustre to gold's largely lost function as a store of value. "Its role as a hedge against inflation doesn't really seem to be needed at this time of the best of all worlds: reasonable levels of economic growth and low inflation," Crisp said.
CCAT	Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) will likely make an announcement later today on the planned sale of its British-based subsidiary Santa Fe Exploration Ltd, a source close to the deal said without elaborating. Market sources had told Reuters on Monday that Norway's Saga Petroleum ASA was close to buying Santa Fe for $1.2 billion. Saga said yesterday it aimed to hold a press conference on Tuesday morning. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
ECAT	Russia plans to return to the international capital markets soon with a dollar Eurobond, First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said. A statement quoting the minister and issued by Chubais's spokesman said the bond, running for at least five years, would be issued through SBC Warburg and JP Morgan, who managed Russia's first dollar Eurobond last November.   Chubais said the exact terms of the bond would be set on the eve of the issue by the Finance Ministry and managers, as usual. Russia's $1 billion Eurobond in November was the largest ever sovereign debut issue, but it was still heavily oversubscribed. The five-year 9.25 percent Eurobond was priced to yield 345 basis points over five-year U.S. Treasury notes. Russia was rated BB- by Standard & Poor's, Ba2 by Moody's and BB+ by IBCA for the issue. Russia issued a two billion mark Eurobond in March this year. The seven-year 9.0 percent bond was priced to yield 370 points over German government bonds, and managed by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and CS First Boston. --Jonathan Lynn, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
MCAT	German shares, after volatile trading on Thursday, were expected to head into Friday depending heavily on overnight results of Wall Street and dollar trading, dealers said. The IBIS DAX stood at 2,892.69 by 1515 GMT, up 11.80 but more than 20 points below the high of 2,916.16 reached earlier. The fall from the record high was prompted by a drop in German bonds and then a fall in the dollar. "When they went down, they took stocks with them," one Frankfurt trader said. "No idea about tomorrow, but it's going to depend on the Dow and the dollar."   March Bunds, which had fueled the stock rally by climbing 30 basis points earlier, slumped in the afternoon to 100.97, down 47 points by 1525 GMT. Earlier, the dollar fed the DAX rally, holding steady at 1.56 marks. When the dollar dropped to 1.5540 by 1525 GMT, shares eased back, especially export-driven shares. Car maker BMW AG, which traded down 19.3 at 1,050 marks by 1430 GMT, had been as high as 1,089. Mannesmann AG, which had soared on rumour of a telecommunicaitons alliance with utility Veba AG, also pared back gains by 1500 GMT to stand at 673 marks, up 4.20.   The Dow Jones index climbed 21.62 to 6,44.56 within an hour, laying a foundation for optimism in Frankfurt on Friday. The DAX climb to record highs early on Thursday after a late surge by the Dow the day before, when the U.S. index narrowed its loss to 19 points after falling as much as 79. German unemployment and the Bundesbank gave less definitive signals for Friday's direction. Seasonally adjsusted unemployment in November rose 50,000 to a record 4.1 million, a sign the economy wasn't gaining momentum. But the Bundesbank kept key interest rates unchanged, an announcement that pushed Bunds downward. -- Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
GCAT	Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth said a report to be released Monday by a federal advisory panel increases the odds that Congress will move to privatize part of the Social Security program. A deeply divided 13-member panel will release three separate plans for ensuring the long-term solvency of the federally-funded retirement program. Proposals range from having the government invest part of the Social Security trust fund in private markets to setting up compulsory savings accounts, with individuals deciding how to invest part of their Social Security retirement funds. "For the first time ever, all members of a Social Security advisory council .... have recommended that some of Social Security's funds be invested in the private marketplace to improve return on Social Security funds," Roth, a Delaware Republican, said in a statement. "This is a very important development and greatly increases the chance that Congress will adopt some kind of investment option," he said. Beginning in 2012 payroll taxes will no longer cover seniors' benefits under the program. By the year 2030 the Social Security trust fund will run a deficit, unless Congress makes changes in the system.
CCAT	Israel's Dead Sea Works Ltd said on Tuesday that targeted marketing had enabled it to boost third-quarter earnings, despite lower sales due to a weaker world market for its main product, potash. "Selective targeting of sales to strong agricultural markets ...effectively maintained the level of sales prices despite the decrease in demand," the company said in a statement. Volume sales of potash, an agrochemical, fell to 505,000 metric tonnes in the quarter from 688,000 a year earlier, the company said. Earlier, it reported a decline in unconsolidated revenues to $80.129 million in the quarter from $100.340 million a year ago. Net income, however, rose to $10.874 million, or $0.04 a share, from $9.757 million, or $0.03 a share. Gross profit also rose, by 1.3 percent, and operating profit by 16.1 percent in the three months. Dead Sea Works, a subsidiary of Israel Chemicals Ltd, attributed the improved profitability to increased production output and cost-cutting measures. Dead Sea Works has been reporting on a consolidated basis since the second quarter of this year to reflect its new joint venture holdings in Dead Sea Magnesium, which it controls with Volkswagen, and in the U.S. company Clearon Inc. But the company provided no year-on-year comparisons. Dead Sea Works said construction of the Dead Sea Magnesium plant was nearing completion and that production was scheduled to begin early next year. - Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
MCAT	Tokyo stocks are expected to weaken in the Monday session amid a cautious mood after a sharp decline in New York stocks on Friday, brokers said. "High-tech issues, which have been a target for foreign investor buying, will likely slip after the fall in New York stocks," said a broker at a second-tier Japanese brokerage. On Friday, the Nikkei 225 average gained 103.41 yen, or 0.54 percent, to 19,326.03. Its September futures rose 160 points to 19,440.   The brokers said that recent fluctuations in the dollar-yen rate were likely to make participants cautious. They said, nevertheless, that public pension funds would likely pick up shares if the Nikkei index falls below the 19,000 level. Brokers said market players would be watching for the release of economic data, such as Japan's July money supply and trade figures on Monday morning.
MCAT	German Bunds took a beating on Wednesday after news of strong M3 data and business confidence in October. But dealers said they did not expect a big sell-off and that Bunds may test their highs again by end-1996. December Bund futures fell as low as 100.69, down 59 basis points from the contract high of 101.28 reached earlier, but later recovered amid short-covering to 100.90. The yield on the benchmark 10-year April 2006 Bund rose to 5.83 percent by 1540 GMT from 5.78 percent in early trade. Dealers said Bunds could fall to around 100.50 or lower in coming days but saw strong demand between 100.20 and 100.30.   The drop accelerated after Bund futures fell though key support at 100.85, triggering stop-loss orders. But a second technical support level around the day's low of 100.69 held, causing short-covering, dealers said. The data dampened what little hope remained of another slight cut in German interest rates and had thereby hit shorter-dated maturities more than the long end of the market which was likely to consolidate, dealers and analysts said. The long end of the market remained supported by the steepness of the German yield curve, with investors still attracted by high returns from longer-dated maturities.   But with rate hopes fading fast and yields at the short end of the market edging higher the yield curve was set to flatten in the the short-term, dealers said. Bunds also remained underpinned by favourable conditions in the U.S. market, where Treasuries remained buoyed by fresh economic data suggesting the economy was slowing with no signs of inflation. The Bund/T-note spread was steady around 44 basis points. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
GCAT	Face-to-face talks between Zaire's ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila will take place "shortly", South Africa said on Tuesday. "The talks will take place shortly...it will be a meeting between President Mobutu and Laurent Kabila," Pieter Swanepoel, spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Department, told Reuters. Swanepoel said the talks would be presided over by President Nelson Mandela and followed extensive consultation with both the rebels and Mobutu's government. South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki will also take part. In a statement issued later, the Foreign Affairs Department said a venue had been agreed upon by both sides and final discussions on a date were being concluded. "The venue will be announced in due course," Swanepoel said. The statement said the talks had been arranged in close cooperation with United Nations special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun. Earlier a South African newspaper said the talks could be held on one of the country's warships in international waters. Business Day said Mobutu could meet Kabila on the naval supply ship Outeniqua. Meeting on a ship, possibly off the coast of Zaire or off the neighbouring Angolan enclave of Cabinda, would allow the cancer-stricken Mobutu to hold talks close to Zaire, the paper said.
ECAT	Turkey's current account gave a deficit of $4.39 billion in 1996, up from $2.34 billion a year ago, the central bank said on Thursday. It said the deficit including Turkey's unregistered earnings from the "suitcase trade" was $1.45 billion in 1996.
GCAT	Queensland pace bowler Andrew Bichel, who shone against the West Indian touring team recently, took five wickets to help dismiss Victoria for a paltry 162 in their Sheffield Shield match in Brisbane on Friday. Bichel finished with five for 46 as Shield leaders Queensland took charge on the opening day of the four-day game. They were 100 for one at the close, with Trevor Barsby unbeaten on 51. Victoria capitulated after former Australia batsman and acting captain Dean Jones, leading the side while skipper Shane Warne is on test duty against West Indies and regular stand-in Tony Dodemaide is injured, won the toss and opted to bat. Jones was immediately made to rue his decision as Bichel, who helped an Australian XI beat West Indies by 10 wickets in Hobart 11 days ago, took the wickets of Victoria's top four batsmen. In Hobart, deposed Australia opener Michael Slater was top scorer for New South Wales with 76 against Tasmania. Slater, discarded for the first two tests against West Indies, dragged his side out of early trouble for New South Wales to be 263 for eight at the close. Brad McNamara was the only other batsman to offer significant resistance and was 54 not out. In Adelaide, all-rounder Joe Scuderi (55) led South Australia from a shaky 150 for five to 277 all out against Western Australia, who were six without loss at the close.
ECAT	The biggest increase in retail inventories in 1-1/2 years boosted overall stocks of unsold goods during July on the shelves of wholesalers retailers and manufacturers, the Commerce Department said Monday. Total business inventories rose 0.4 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $1 trillion after being revised to show no change in June.  Previously, the department said June inventories rose 0.1 percent.   The July increase in total stocks of unsold goods was significantly stronger than the 0.2 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists, primarily because retailers added strongly to their supplies. Retail inventories jumped 1.1 percent to $307.52 billion -- the biggest increase since a 1.3 percent surge in January 1995 -- after a slight 0.1 percent June increase. Auto inventories, which show up in the retail figures, climbed strongly by 1.4 percent to $86.1 billion, the largest addition to monthly supplies since a two percent jump in March 1995.   Automakers had been expected to add to their supplies of new cars on dealer lots for fear of a strike this fall. Negotiations are currently underway between the Big Three domestic automakers and the United Auto Workers union. Manufacturers' inventories grew by 0.2 percent to $434.52 billion in July after a 0.1 percent decline in June. Wholesalers' inventories were up 0.1 percent to $259.45 billion following a 0.2 percent June gain. Total business sales in July grew by 1.2 percent to $720.55 billion after a 0.5 percent drop in June. The inventory-to-sales ratio -- a measure of how long it would take to sell existing stocks at the current pace -- fell to 1.39 months' worth in July from 1.40 months in June.
ECAT	Singapore exports of non-oil goods fell a nominal 2.1 percent year-on-year in March to Singapore $7.67 billion (US$5.33 billion), after falling 7.9 percent in February, the Trade Development Board (TDB) said on Monday. In real terms, non-oil exports rose 0.5 percent in March to S$9.88 billion after falling 4.4 percent in February. The figures were slightly better than expected. A Reuters poll of 11 economists last week had forecast a 4.5 percent drop in the nominal figure. The nominal figures take no account of inflation. The TDB said in a statement the decline in exports was largely due to continuing problems in the electronics industry, which accounts for around half Singapore's manufacturing output and approaching 60 percent of its non-oil exports. "Though it was less severe than the 7.9 percent contraction in the previous month, it reflected continued weakness in the global demand for some electronics and related products such as semi-conductors," the statement said. The TDB said non-oil sales to the United States decreased by 10.6 percent to S$2.1 billion in March. It said the decrease was reflected in domestic exports of disk drives, computer parts and peripherals and other electronics goods. Non-oil exports to the European Union rose 4.9 percent to S$1.6 billion, while exports to Malaysia increased by 2.7 percent to S$1.0 billion.
GCAT	New Zealand were poised for certain victory over Pakistan after another remarkable performance on the third day of the first test on Saturday. Chasing a victory target of 276 with more than two days to spare, Pakistan had slumped to a miserable 46 for five after losing skipper Saeed Anwar on the second ball of their second innings. At stumps, Salim Malik was on 15 and debutant Mohammad Wasim was on nought when play was halted seven overs early due to poor light. Pace bowler Simon Doull, the chief destroyer in the first innings, was again the tormentor, claiming Anwar and Ijaz Ahmad in the space of five balls. Anwar was trapped leg before the wicket, the 15th batsmen to be dismissed in this way in the match so far, two short of the world record lbw dismissals of 17 at Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, when Pakistan played the West Indies in the 1993/94 series. Ijaz, like his captain, also fell cheaply for the second time when he exposed his leg stump after scoring only eight. Inzamamul Haq was third out at 25, caught smartly by Bryan Young at second slip off Chris Cairns for 14, and a run later Pakistan lost their fourth wicket when nightwatchman Saqlain Mushtaq was removed by Justin Vaughan. New Zealand then capped off a magnificent day with their fifth wicket of opener Zahoor Elahi, who was taken low down by Young off off-spinner Dipak Patel for eight. New Zealand have won in Pakistan only re,  when Graham Dowling's side triumphed at Lahore by five wickets in 1969. The visiting side owed their second innings total of 311 to the brilliant knocks of 92 and 93 by Stephen Fleming and Cairns after resuming at 88 for five. The two Canterbury batsmen shared a sixth-wicket stand of 141 in 34.3 overs to put their side in a strong position. Cairns, dropped at seven by Inzamam off leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmad, rode his luck to smash a sparkling 93 off 89 balls, slamming 12 fours and three sixes. The left-handed Fleming was stranded at 92 after last man Doull was stumped for 26. The two added 48 runs for the last wicket to prolong Pakistan's agony. Fleming, overnight on 12, batted with great assurance and hit 13 fours and a six in his stay spanning 281 minutes and 197 balls. Fleming and Cairns led the fine recovery after Nathan Astle had fallen at his overnight three and Mark Greatbatch's stumps wred by Waqar Younis. Mushtaq who caused a minor middle collapse in which Chris Harris, Lee Germon and Dipak Patel fell quickly, finished with six for 84 for a match bag of 10 for 143, the second 10-wicket haul of his career.
GCAT	Alania Vladikavkaz, who have missed three penalties in two successive defeats, face a further test of their Russian league resolve on Saturday. The 1996 runners-up and 1995 champions, with just three points from three games so far, travel to Samara where Krylya Sovietov (Soviet Wings) are joint top with maximum points. To make matters worse, the league disciplinary committee on Friday confirmed a five-match ban on Alania striker Anatoly Kanishchev. He missed Wednesday's 2-0 home defeat by Zenit after a provisional suspension imposed when he failed to show up for international duty against Cyprus last weekend. At least Alania, who lost last year's championship in a playoff to Spartak Moscow, will have the services of Georgian sweeper Kakhaber Tskhadadze. A defensive organiser as well as a goalscorer, he also missed Wednesday's game through suspension. Ominously, though, Samara, whose miserly defence earned the curious nickname "The Volga Clothes-pegs" in Soviet days, have yet to concede a goal. After a 5-0 hammering of KamAZ on the first day of the season, Alania's only real scoring chances in the last two games have been four penalties. They only managed to convert one of them. Champions and joint leaders Spartak, who humiliated capital rivals Torpedo with three spectacular goals without reply on Wednesday, should have few problems at lowly Tyumen.
ECAT	Ministers, bureaucrats and lobby groups, with hundreds of journalists in their wake, streamed into Singapore at the weekend for the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial conference starting on Monday. Awaiting the visitors were 6,000 local staff including tour guides, chauffeurs and chefs, as Singapore's authorities endeavour to ensure the prestigious event goes off without a hitch. The straight-laced island state has even relaxed its ban on smoking inside buildings -- but only in the corridors of the huge new SUNTEC conference centre where the 128 WTO members hold their week-long meeting. The Singapore government has set aside a budget of S$18 million (US$12.8 million) for lavish receptions, complimentary buffet lunches, and passes for free phone calls and transport. The meeting, the first ministerial conference of the Geneva-based WTO since its launch two years ago to replace the 47-year-old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), has drawn senior trade officials from all over the world. Top officials attending the talks include Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and the European Union's trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan. The British delegation will be headed by Ian Lang, president of the Board of Trade, and Australia's by Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer. Other representives include Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan and Malaysia's minister of international trade and industry, Rafidah Aziz. China's assistant minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation and the chief negotiator for China's entry into the WTO, Long Yongtu, will attend as an observer. New Zealand's caretaker foreign minister Don McKinnon withdrew from the conference on Saturday as two months of coalition talks at home neared their climax. Another face missing from the rostrum will be that of International Labour Organisation (ILO) director general Michel Hansenne, whose invitation was withdrawn due to pressure from developing nations opposed to linking trade with labour issues. Among the cast of non-governmental organisations at the meeting are ActionAid and Christian Aid, the Humane Society of the United States and the World Wildlife Fund. Also present are trade groups from Britain, Norway, India, Australia, Canada, Mexico and South Korea. International stars will be on hand to entertain the ministers and delegates when the conference ends. They include Lea Salonga, star of the musical "Miss Saigon" when it opened in London, singer Shirley Bassey, Sarah Brightman, former wife of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and star of his musical "Phantom of the Opera", and Hindi-language pop star Sharon Prabhakawill.
MCAT	Irish government bonds were barely moved in thin late trade on Tuesday as the market awaited news of a possible rise in U.S. rates at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, dealers said. "The market is very little changed on the opening levels," one dealer said. "Everyone is waiting on news from the FOMC. The dollar has been well bid which is supportive but the crucial thing is what happens to U.S. rates. That is the key for the next 24 hours," the dealer said.   By 1510 GMT, the 8.00 percent bond due 2000 had eased six pence from Monday's close to 103.98 to yield 6.74 percent while the 8.00 percent bond due 2006 rose eight pence on the day to 103.40 to yield 7.37 percent. The one-month money market rate, which has remained above the key 5.50 level since the beginning of August, was at 5.56/5.68 compared with 5.56/5.59 at the close. Dealers said if the FOMC leaves U.S. rates unchanged then the next focus will be on the Bundesbank meeting on Thursday. "If the FOMC raises rates, then the Bundesbank meeting will not be as crucial," the dealer said.   "Should the FOMC not raise rates, then the Bundesbank will become the main focus of attention. So, all told, everything depends on what happens in the United States later today," the dealer added. -- Damien Lynch, Dublin Newsroom +353 1 6603377
MCAT	Tokyo stocks plunged nearly 700 points in frantic trade on Friday, their biggest fall in a year and a half, after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of "irrational exuberance" in U.S. markets. Fears of a possible Wall Street dive later on Friday provoked panic sales in Tokyo, sending indices into a tailspin. Japanese government bonds and the dollar were also hit. "Greenspan's comment sparked fears about New York stock movements tonight and forced people to close their positions ahead of the weekend," said Chisato Takahashi, a fund manager at Credit Suisse Investment Advisory Co. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index ended down more than three percent after Greenspan's comments on Thursday night, which came before the Tokyo opening, fuelled fears about recent euphoria on Wall Street. The Nikkei shed 667.20 points to end at 20,276.70, having fallen as low as 20,171.69. It was the largest decline since April 3, 1995. Its December futures were 730 points lower at 20,210. Greenspan had told a dinner meeting that the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up doing damage to the economy. "We as central bankers need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs and price stability," he said. Although Greenspan stopped short of commenting on the recent steep rise in Wall Street prices, dealers took the comment as a sign that the Fed was indeed concerned. "People saw the comment as showing that the Fed thinks the present situation (in U.S. financial markets) is a bubble," said Yasuhito Kawashima, chief manager of foreign exchange at Toyo Trust & Banking Co. Jesper Koll, chief economist at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo, said yen markets were "almost certainly overreacting". "I think any dip below 20,500 is a buy as large-cap companies will pull off formidable earnings surprises in the coming six to 12 months," he said in a commentary. The Fed holds its next policy-making meeting on December 17 and is widely expected to opt to hold interest rates steady amid signs of moderate economic growth with steady inflation. Greenspan's remarks triggered heavy sales of the dollar because of fears that U.S. stocks and bonds would take a battering later on Friday, dealers said. The dollar stood at around 111.89 yen and 1.5380 marks in late afternoon Tokyo, against New York closes of about 112.33 yen and 1.5495 marks. Japanese government bonds, both cash and futures, also suffered, undermined by slumping U.S. Treasury bonds as well as large-lot selling by powerful institutional investors. The key March JGB contract ended the session at 125.38 after dipping to a low of 125.10 from Thursday's 126.34. A hefty volume of 11.8385 trillion yen ($105 billion) was traded. The key U.S. 30-year Treasury bond was down more than 1-1/3 points from New York's Thursday close and traded at 98-17/32 in late Tokyo. Tokyo stocks had risen earlier in the day, aided by news that telecoms giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) would be split up into a long-distance company and two local-call firms under a single holding company. The decision follows a decade of debate over how Japan can best compete in the increasingly global telecoms business. The news boosted NTT shares, as well as some other blue-chip issues, such as Sony Corp. NTT shares ended up 15,000 yen ($133) at 845,000 yen ($7,544,). ($1=112 yen)
MCAT	Tokyo stocks closed slightly higher on Friday in a market that was relieved by a fairly smooth settlement of March Nikkei 225 stock futures and options contracts earlier in the day. But participants were still cautious, waiting for the government to unveil specific measures to boost land liquidity, which could help pep up Japan's sluggish economy, brokers said. The Nikkei 225 average gained 23.16 points or 0.13 percent to finish at 17,923.64. The index had briefly sunk to a low of 17,616.79. Its June futures ended 30 points higher at 17,830.
MCAT	Another poor start on Wall Street on Monday following three consecutive declines last week damped already nervous European share trading and the main bourses all closed down. On currency markets the dollar was firm and near its session peaks at the European close, buoyed by stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer spending figures -- adding to speculation that U.S. rates may soon rise. The London stock exchange, which had been weaker earlier in the day, closed only slightly off after the market made a late recovery, inspired by the Dow bouncing back from an almost 50 point deficit in early New York trade to be just four points down when European business ended. The FTSE 100 index ended just 1.2 points down at 4,307.1, its highest point of the day after dropping as low as 4,287.3 in early trade. "We've done remarkably well considering the state of Wall Street," one dealer said. "The Dow has come off more than 150 points in the last few days and we have been coping well." Dealers said more money was expected this month from private investors, ahead of the April deadline for investing in Personal Equity Plans (PEPs), a tax-efficient method of share ownership in Britain. One big faller was NatWest Bank , which lost 28 pence to 730.5 as the stock went ex-dividend and investors reacted to news on Friday that it had lost 50 million pounds ($81 million) on options trading. Political worries ahead of a British election, due by late May, also unsettled investor sentiment, dealers said. "After last week's by-election (which the ruling Conservative Party lost by a big margin) people are starting to focus on the fact of a change of government," the head of trading at a major investment bank said. Paris also closed with moderate losses, lacking domestic momentum and taking its direction from softness on Wall Street. The CAC index had been supported by dollar strength since the opening, but faded as investment interest waned in the afternoon, leaving it vulnerable to New York's sway. But the blue chip CAC index managed to stay above the psychological 2,600 level. In Frankfurt, German shares which ended floor trading four points up before New York opened, slipped under the influence of Wall Street in later electronic trade. The DAX IBIS index, which measures screen trading, closed marginally down. Dealers said  it had been an uninspired bourse session, with buying interest held back by Wall Street's poor performances towards the end of last week. Markets on both sides of the Atlantic are expected to remain nervous this week, with key U.S. data and more of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony looming. Greenspan concludes his testimony on Wednesday. Last week he sent stock markets sharply lower with a warning that Wall Street's recent rise had "raised questions of sustainability." Analysts said the February U.S. employment report on Friday would also keep markets on edge this week. U.S. consumer spending figures on Monday showed the strongest pickup since last October, adding to the feeling the Federal Reserve may soon hike interest rates. Meanwhile in Athens, the Greek bourse plunged 7.45 percent, a record fall for a single day as investors sold shares across-the-board. Monday's fall took investor losses over the past three sessions 1.2 trillion drachmas ($4.51 billion). Stunned brokers debated whether the fall was caused by civil strife in neighbouring Albania, a capital market commission warning which many claim pulled the rug from under the market or simply valuation physics pointing to a correction. A key indicator for the currency markets on Monday was the February report from the U.S. National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM). Its index rose to 53.1, stronger than consensus estimates of a rise to 52.9 percent, and up from 52.0 in January. The dollar firmed from around 1.6910 marks ahead of the NAPM figure to just above 1.6930 marks after it was released. The data also gave it a boost against the yen. Most of the dollar's gains against the mark held after the mark was hit in early dealings by reports of a rise in German unemployment in February. The German unit's losses were limited, however, by concerns about EMU's timetable -- EMU convergence is seen as a weakening influence on the mark. Jitters about a possible delay to the start of economic and monetary union (EMU) have weakened the Italian lira and Spanish peseta over the past week and the downward pressure continued on Monday. A vigorous verbal defense of the EMU timetable from a range of European officials helped calm early market jitters and the lira rallied from lows alongside speculation of central bank intervention. The Bank of Spain too was seen selling marks. CURRENCIES AT 1700 GMT The dollar was at 1.6950 marks and 121.15 yen, compared with 1.6885 and 120.88 in late European trade on Friday. STOCK MARKETS - CLOSING INDICES LONDON - The FTSE-100 index closed down 1.2 points at 4,307.1. PARIS - The CAC-40 closed down 7.29 points at 2,600.26. FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index closed up 4.22  points at 3,263.86. PRECIOUS METALS Gold ended at $362.25 compared with London's previous close of $358.45. Silver was at $5.24 .

ECAT	Russian gross domestic product calculations for January and February reflect increased weighting given to the unofficial underground economy, a State Statistics Committee official said on Friday. Vladimir Sokolin, Deputy Chairman of the committee, told a news conference an overall review of economic indicators going back as far as 1990 was possible. He said that by the end of last year the shadow economy, which includes street vendors and entrepreneurs with unregistered businesses among others, accounted for around 23 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The shadow economy had accounted for about 20 percent of earlier calculations. "It's very possible that it will increase to 25 percent," Sokolin said. He said 1996 committee figures did not reflect what he said was a reversal in the downward trend of the Russian economy which started in the second half of last year. "There will definitely be a review of both 1996 and 1997 figures," Solokin said, adding that work on the review would begin in April. He said a more in-depth revision of methodology to be completed by the end of 1997 could lead to a further overhaul of economic statistics going back to 1990. But Sokolin denied accusations the committee had changed its methodology. He said the dynamics of the economy had changed. "If you're observing a family that last year had one child and this year has another child you can't really say that statistics changed the family," said Sokolin. --Christina Ling, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
ECAT	The Group of 10 (G10) central bank governors will discuss work by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision and the worldwide economic situation at their regular monthly meeting, Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said. Tietmeyer, who chairs the central bank governors committee, said he would brief reporters after the meeting in early afternoon. He spoke briefly to reporters as he was entering the Bank for International Settlements building. Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan is also attending the meeting, but he made no comments. Banking supervisors are considering some kind of global banking standards aimed at preventing financial crises in the next century. -- Zurich Editorial +41 1 631 7340
GCAT	The common technique of using allergy shots to help reduce childhood asthma problems has failed to work in a study of 121 children, according to a report in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. But the finding were so unexpected that authors of the report are urging caution in its acceptance, the report said. Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine researchers gave 60 youngsters placebo shots while 61 others received injections designed to protect them against allergies to several substances. According to conventional wisdom, the children who were immunised against their allergies should have needed less asthma medicine than those who received the placebo. But they did not. The study found the amount of medicine consumed by the two groups was essentially the same. "We were unable to demonstrate any effect of allergen injections on the course of the asthma over a period of 30 months," said the Johns Hopkins team led by Dr. N. Franklin Adkinson Jr. About one in 20 adults suffer from the shortness of breath caused by periodic attacks of asthma. The disease is far more common in children -- about one in 10 have it -- and many outgrow it. Attacks are often sparked by an allergic reaction to pollen, dust, animal fur, feathers or other substances. Past research has shown that when a child is sensitive to a single allergen, allergy shots reduce symptoms. The Hopkins team did not set out to cast doubt on that treatment. They were curious about the effectiveness of allergy shots designed to protect children who were sensitive to several substances. In this case, many of the children were allergic to dust mites, short ragweed and rye-group grasses. The new findings are expected to force doctors to take a hard look at the treatment and whether it is a waste of time and money. Adkinson and his colleagues acknowledged that the findings "are contrary to widely held clinical opinion and the results of some studies of asthma and single allergens." One possible explanation for the unexpected result may be the youngsters were getting too much medicine to start with. The study was designed to encourage each child's doctor to reduce the amount of medicine prescribed for the youngster whenever tests showed an improvement in the youngster's condition. Often, cautious doctors resisted. "Nonetheless, over time, medications were withdrawn and the children in both groups did well, as evidenced by the significant declines in medication scores," the researchers said. They said 34 children (of a total of 121) were taking no medications by the end of the study, indicating that the effort to reduce medications during the study was successful. The improvement in both groups may have overwhelmed the benefits of the allergy shots, the Adkinson team said. He noted "the participants in our study were not typical of allergic children treated for asthma in routine clinical practice." They came from families willing to be involved in a long-term study, the children and parents got in-depth counselling and the youngsters were seen by a doctor every two or three weeks. As a result, the doctors noted a "substantial" improvement in their asthma even before the children were segregated into treatment and control groups. All of this, said the Adkins group, "may have controlled the disease process to such an extent that it would have been difficult to show the clinical benefit of any number of relatively weak but nevertheless effective therapies."
MCAT	The bellwether U.S. 30-year bond was down more than half a point in mid-afternoon trading, extending earlier losses on fears of further Federal Reserve rate hikes, players said. At 1420 EST/1920 GMT, the bond was off 18/32 at 95-5/32, with its yield climbing to 7.01 percent. "The Fed's in the process of tightening," one trader said. "There are buyers on the way down, but we are going up in rate." Additionally, analysts said sell orders were made as the June bond contract hit 108-8/32, which is equivalent to a 7.00 percent cash bond yield. (( -- N.A. Treasury Desk, 212-859-1660 ))
ECAT	Another round of interest rate cuts is on the horizon in Europe, analysts said on Wednesday. Slumbering economies, subdued inflationary pressures, fiscal trends and currency flows all point to lower borrowing costs in countries from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia. Italy is the latest to take the plunge, slashing 3/4 of a point off a key rate on Tuesday, and more easings are expected. "It's very simple. There's no inflation threat in Europe," said Brian Venables, senior bond economist at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett in Amsterdam. "And everybody needs growth." Even Germany's Bundesbank, the kingpin of central banks in Europe, might opt for another interest rate cut in the coming months, although any credit easing will be minor, analysts said. "For the Scandinavians, you're talking about small cuts. For Italy we're looking for sizeable cuts. And in core Europe the cuts would be marginal," Venables said. The Bank of Italy cut the discount rate to 6.75 percent from 7.50 percent late on Tuesday. That compares with Germany's three percent discount rate, last cut in August 1996. Last week Spain reduced its key repo rate to 6.00 percent from 6.25 and Sweden lowered its repo rate to 4.10 percent from 4.35. Both countries pruned short-term rates steadily throughout 1996, while Italy has opted for fewer, but chunkier, rate cuts. Steven Major, head of bond research at Credit Lyonnais in London, noted the differing styles of rate reduction methods and said this pattern was likely to continue. "Italy is very much in a three-to-four-month cycle," he said, meaning it prefers to space out its credit easings, allowing the markets to price them in ahead of time. "It is in the Bank of Italy's interest to draw out the rate cuts," Major said. By doing so, the authorities were pushing down inflation and encouraging flows into the lira, which had an added anti-inflationary impact, he said. "Spain has gravitated towards the Swedish style rather than the Italian style. Spain has cut twice in the past month and is very likely to cut again next month," he said. Major said Swedish short-term rates even had scope to go below German rates, with the crown still firm and authorities under pressure to cut borrowing costs to get the economy into good fiscal shape for any move to a single European currency. It was the same story elsewhere. "The general pressure in the peripheral markets -- particularly Italy and Spain -- is the need to qualify for Maastricht," said Ifty Islam, European bond strategist at Merrill Lynch in London. As such, any inflationary risks these countries were running by slashing interest rates were outweighed by the need to get growth moving, if only to ensure that deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratios were low, analysts said. "It's more important to get your deficit down than to converge on inflation," Islam said. Credit Lyonnais's Major considered Sweden, Finland, Spain, Italy and Portugal as likely rate cut candidates in the coming months. ABN AMRO's Venables added Norway to that list. Meanwhile Britain, which is undecided on whether to participate in a single currency, is one of the few European countries enjoying decent economic growth. Bank of England governor Eddie George has called for a modest monetary tightening, but speculation has died down recently about the urgency for a rate increase. With signs of diminished consumer demand and lower than expected producer price pressures, many think rates may be on hold for a while.
MCAT	Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) has bought through tender 3,500 tonnes of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) for May 6-20 delivery between $275 to $280 per tonne, cost-and-freight (c-and-f) Kaohsiung and Keelung, a company official said on Tuesday.

GCAT	Reform Party candidate Ross Perot on Thursday ridiculed Republican Bob Dole's plea that he quit the presidential race and back Dole as "weird and totally inconsequential" and said he was in the race to stay. "Am I in this for the long haul? Yes. Do I intend to campaign to the bitter end? Yes," Perot said in response to questions at a National Press Club appearance.   Asked about reports -- confirmed earlier by his own aides -- that Dole had sent an envoy to ask him to drop out and support the Republican challenger against Democratic President Bill Clinton, Perot said he would not divulge what had been said in a private conversation. But Perot bristled with annoyance at the focus given the Dole episode while he was trying to promote his own demands for campaign finance reform and federal budget balancing. He added: "Isn't it fascinating that .... if something weird and totally inconsequential pops up like this thing (involving Dole) yesterday, that is really big news, right?" Asked if that were a sign of desperation by Dole, who trails Clinton by double-digit figures in most polls with the election on Nov. 5, Perot said: "In no way do I want to do anything  to harm another candidate's constructive campaign ... The thing I can assure you is that I am here, I am here to stay."
GCAT	The mother-in-law of a doctor who treats Russian President Boris Yeltsin was stabbed to death on Tuesday, but officials said the doctor would continue looking after the Kremlin leader, who is preparing for heart surgery. Public Russian Television (ORT) said Anna Ichko, 70, was found dead in her flat with two knife wounds. Relatives nearly caught one of the attackers, who jumped off the balcony of the apartment as the relatives tried to open the front door. An investigator told the television the incident looked like a robbery and appeared to have no political motive. Ichko was mother-in-law of doctor Vladlen Vtorushin, who has been treating Yeltsin for over two years, ORT said. "Vladlen Vtorushin is a strong man. He will be able to cope with this tragedy and there is no need to replace him," it quoted Sergei Mironov, head of the Kremlin medical centre, as saying. The ORT anchorwoman took a more emotional line, recalling that a personal doctor of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was also killed earlier this year. "A natural question arises -- maybe now, ahead of the president's operation, we should not make public the names of those who would carry it out?" the presenter said. The 65-year-old Russian leader announced on September 5 that he would have heart surgery and moved into Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital on September 13 to allow doctors to prepare him for the operation. Over the weekend he moved to the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow. Russian heart surgeon Renat Akchurin is expected to lead the operation, expected in up to eight weeks.
CCAT	Ashland Inc now expects its petroleum unit to be earning a return exceeding 10 percent within five years, President Paul W. Chellgren told Reuters. The company's goal is an 11 to 13 percent after tax return on unleveraged capital for all lines of business, the chief executive noted during an interview. With the company's cost of capital at 9 to 10 percent, he continued, 10 percent is the minimum return. Ashland Petroleum, the company's refinery and wholesale product sales arm, earned 3 percent last year, the company reported recently.   Raising Ashland Petroleum's return to 10 percent would boost its operating income to about $200 million based on the company's current investment, Chellgren said. Noting this is about $150 million higher than the unit earned in fiscal 1996, ended September 30, he said it "would add $1.30 per share" to last year's profit of $2.97 per share. Chellgren did not say how he expected to accomplish the increase.   Monday night he told security analysts "Ashland's board has for at least five years been regularly studying, both internally and with outside investment bankers, a wide variety of possible combinations including spearating into several companies. "We have been unable to come up with dramatic alternatives that when fairly analyzed would clearly benefit our shareholders," Chellgren said. He also told the analysts the company "will take action to de-emphasize our involvement in businesses which are not earning adequate returns." The chief executive also pointed out the company believes it has made some refining and marketing accomplishments during the past few years, noting Ashland Petroleum's throughput was up last year while refining costs declined. Chief Financial Officer J. Marvin Quinn told the analysts' meeting, which was closed to the press, that refinery runs increased 5 percent to nearly 369,000 barrels daily last year, but a $2.22 per barrel increase in Ashland's crude input costs during the year, to $20.50 per barrel, "could not be fully passed through in product prices." Chellgren told Reuters "we like this business rationalizing" represented by the proposed Diamond Shamrock Inc/Ultramar Corp merger and the Texaco Inc/Shell Oil Co refining and marketing venture. "I'm not aware of other imminent" proposals, he added. -- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.
GCAT	Albania's bunkers, one of the most paranoid legacies of its former Stalinist government, are getting a new lease of life -- as chicken coops, mushroom farms, art galleries, cafes and even tiny dank homes. In a country once so worried about invasion that it placed metal spikes in vineyards to skewer parachutists, Albanians are constantly looking for ways to recycle an estimated 500,000 domed concrete bunkers. "Even bombs can't hurt us," said Jonuz Kasmi, 47, who lives in his pill-box with walls 30 cm (one foot) thick by a roadside overlooking a river west of Tirana. "But I can't recommend living in a bunker," he said. Kasmi, his wife and four children, have lived for three-and-a-half years crammed into a space about five metres (16 feet) across and 2.5 metres (eight feet) at the highest point. He has electricity, water and a gun if needed to defend his family from bandits following the insurrection which swept Albania last month. Pointing north, south, east, and west -- tiny Albania saw enemies everywhere -- the bunkers drained resources from a desperately poor country that was Europe's most hermetic state for 45 years until communism collapsed in 1990. "This is probably the only area of the economy where we don't need new investment," said Colonel Qemal Mehmeti of the Defence Ministry. BUNKERS COST SAME AS A SMALL FLAT "Too many were built...even in the mountains where there are natural hiding places," he said. "Even the small ones cost 25,000 leks ($2,500 at the time). That was the price of a flat with one or two bedrooms and a kitchen." Albania began building bunkers as its main fortifications after its ties with the former Soviet Union soured and Tirana pulled out of the Warsaw Pact in 1968. It turned to China but went it alone in the mid-1970s, angered at Beijing's rapprochement with Washington. Apart from the bunkers and grids of spikes in vineyards, it dug tunnels under cities for air raid shelters. The feared blitz never came. Albanians, who had always been told that threats came from abroad, are preparing for the arrival of a multinational Italian-led force to protect aid supplies after the insurrection, triggered by domestic anger at the collapse of savings schemes. "I keep hay for my cows in my bunker," said Qerim Shala, a 57-year-old farmer west of Tirana. "I used to have two smaller ones, but an Italian man came along with a crane and pulled them up. It's helped because I can now use the land to grow grapes," he said. ALBANIAN DEFENCE STILL RELIES ON BUNKERS Mehmeti reckoned 10 percent of bunkers have been wrecked by people, hit by landslips or choked by weeds. Even so, they remain a key part of Albania's defences -- people can turn them to non-military uses only if they do no structural damage. "My neighbour keeps chickens in his," said Isuf Hoxha, 71, who has three small bunkers in his 50 metre (yard) garden, including one overgrown by weeds. "Even during the communist years I never felt protected," he said as a police armoured car rumbled past. "The bunkers disrupted the land, the beaches, our homes. Why? They're useless." Hoxha, no relation to the late communist dictator Enver Hoxha who built the bunkers, showed off a metal spike that used to be atop a concrete post in his vineyard. "This was for the imperalists!" he laughed, jabbing it skywards. Near the port of Durres, bunkers along the beach have been converted into seaside cafes. Further south in Qeparo, some Italians have decorated bunkers with bright paintings. Two are painted pink to look like giant breasts. Many farmers use their bunkers to store farm machinery. Some people have tried growing mushrooms in the cool soil inside. Others suggest they could be dumped in the sea to make breakwaters to halt erosion or make marinas. They come in two sizes -- big ones that a handful of people have turned into homes and the smaller, standard size, three metres (10 feet) across that weigh about 25 tonnes. They have a slit on one side for shooting, and an entrance behind. In the Erzen river between Tirana and the coast, a few dozen shattered bunkers from a bridge-building project lie like giant broken eggshells. So far, there are too few even to break the flow of the river. Almost no one can afford to blow up bunkers or hire cranes to destroy them. Mehmeti said that under a 1996 law, bunkers cannot normally be moved. "If a site is to be cleared for a factory, to build flats or a road, for instance, then they can be taken away. But not just to clear farmland," he said. "They might still be needed. The Balkan region has been unstable. And they are completely defensive," he said. IN TEST, SOME SHEEP, COWS SURVIVE BUNKER BLITZ Mehmeti said the design was solid. A 44-year-old career officer, he said he took part in tests under communism, blasting artillery fire at bunkers with sheep or cows inside. "Some of them survived," he said. Many men in the country of 3.4 million have memories of back-breaking work carrying sacks of material to build bunkers in remote border areas. From 1975, they were pre-fabricated. Expressing resignation about the presence of the bunkers, one Albanian joke asks: "What did you get from the land privatisation?" The answer: "Two hectares and three bunkers." Albanian souvenir makers have found a new use for the bunkers -- mini-bunkers in marble are popular with tourists. And even though many Albanians gripe about the bunkers, some have wistful memories -- bunkers every 50 metres (yards) or so along the beaches of the Adriatic were favoured lovers' hideaways during communism.
MCAT	U.S. municipal bond prices drifted lower throughout the day Monday, losing about 1/4 to 3/8 point in quiet action, traders said. With no real action in the primary or secondary markets and no key data releases Monday, the tone was "cautious," one trader said, adding that the lack of follow-through from last week's gains prompted some profit taking. "We've got nothing going on here 'til Friday," the trader said, referring to the September Producer Price Index and retail sales figures set for release at the end of the week.   The Treasury long bond was also suffering profit taking, off 14/32 heading into the New York close. The yield moved to 6.79 percent. In the muni secondary, Denver Airport MBIA 5-1/2s of 2025 were bid at a 5.78 percent yield, up five basis points from Friday. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 5-5/8s of 2026 were up one basis point to 5.78 percent net. In debt futures, the December municipal contract closed down 26/32 to 115-15/32 and the December T-bond fell 17/32 to 111-5/32. The MOB spread narrowed nine ticks from Friday to 138 ticks.   In the new issue market, Goldman Sachs & Co said it repriced and restructured $116.6 million Washington Public Power Supply System refunding revenue bonds, for Nuclear Project No 1. At the repricing, Goldman adjusted yields in several maturities but left the top yield in 2017 unchanged at 5.82 percent. Merrill Lynch & Co said it had a $20.2 million balance on Oak Ridge, Tenn.'s $16 million general obligation and $7 million electric system revenue bond issues. Merrill won the deals in competitive bidding Monday.   Tuesday primary market deals include Wisconsin's $100 million health bond issue through senior manager Merrill Lynch & Co. That deal tops a list totaling about $422 million of negotiated offerings expected Tuesday. On the competitive list are 18 sales totaling $195 million, including a $58.6 million Virginia Housing Development Authority deal set for 1100 EDT. Tuesday data releases are sparse, but the Treasury plans to auction $10 billion of 10-year notes. --Steven Dickson, 212-859-1652
ECAT	Pakistan on Wednesday unveiled plans to narrow its trade gap to $2.33 billion in fiscal 1997/98 (July-June) from $3.37 billion in 1996/97. Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar, announcing the policy for 1997/98 after approval by the cabinet, said exports were to grow 15 percent to $9.575 billion from the year-earlier's $8.26 billion and imports to $11.9 billion from $11.63 billion. "Export-led growth is the cornerstone of this government's economic strategy," he said in a televised speech. "Larger and high value-added exports will not only help improve the balance of payments but will also provide employment opportunities," he said. "To lay the foundations of a robust outward-oriented economy, it is now imperative to reverse the anti-export bias in the economic structure evolved over the last 50 years." He said there would be adequate export finance for small- and medium-sized exporters through commercial banks at lower rates. Dar said 50 percent of the duty drawback to exporters would now be paid within three days of the presentation of documents and the balance after verification of customs authorities. "Machinery (not manufactured locally) imported by engineering units for export-related production (will) be subject to a zero rate of tariff up to 200 percent of the export value during the preceding financial year... "This facility would be available on an annual basis up to 30th June, 2000," he added. Local assemblers and manufacturers of vehicles had been allowed duty-free imports of assembly kits, corresponding to the number of their exported units, Dar said. "There would be no sales tax on imported raw materials, components required for manufacturing goods to be supplied against international tenders," he added. Dar said exporters would also be allowed to import, duty free, textile designs, artwork and transparencies up to 0.5 percent of the value of exports. He also announced duty-free import of raw sugar for further exports after refining. "This would save foreign exchange, utilise idle capacity of sugar mills and result in value addition," Dar added. Pakistan would open up the import of gold and silver, which was now allowed for only three companies, he said. "However, foreign exchange for such imports will be privately arranged by the importer as per existing practice." He said most measures would be effective in a month, hoping the export of non-traditional items would register an increase of $500 million in 1997/98 and the traditional exports based on cotton and textiles to bring an additional $815 million.

MCAT	U.S. employment data has been a major focus for the markets in recent months but Friday's figures have got forex traders more jittery than of late. This time last year stocks and bonds were pole-axed by a totally unexpected 705,000 leap in February non-farm payrolls and a slide in the unemployment rate to 5.5 from 5.7 percent. Analysts said the market has been setting itself up for a strong set of data this time around, although last year's strong data was in large part due to a bounce back from a negative number in January. "Underlying signs are still quite positive and weekly jobless claims, data and employment indices from business surveys have been reasonably buoyant," said Tim Fox, Treasury Economist at Standard Chartered. "There is no real reason to expect a weak set of figures." A Reuters consensus market forecast shows a  230,000 rise in non-farm payrolls is anticipated, after 271,000 growth in January, and the overall level of unemployment is seen edging down to 5.3 percent from 5.4 percent. The hourly earnings rate and average workweek will be a focus, particularly after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments last week which convinced many in the market that he is ready to take a pre-emptive shot at inflation. "To a certain extent the focus has shifted from the payroll number itself to the average earnings," said Ian Morris, International Economist at HSBC James Capel. Although a strong figure is to some extent priced in, analysts said current bullishness surrounding the dollar meant that any downturn would be regarded as an opportunity to buy. A strong set of data would hit stocks and bonds and drag the dollar down. Last year the February figure pared 171 points off Wall Street and bond yields staged their biggest one day surge since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. And bond yields have been rising lately, with the key long bond currently at 6.8 percent. "The overall trend in bond yields over the past couple of weeks has been up and I wouldn't be surprised to see it go above seven percent on the payrolls," HSBC's Morris, who is expecting a non-farms rise nearer 325,000, said. Expectations of a rise in U.S. rates at the March 25 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting are gathering pace, but opinion is still very much divided. Even though economic data may be strong, the rallying dollar -- up 11.5 percent on the mark and 5.2 percent on the yen so far this year -- will help keep the lid on inflation. With the market bullish and tending to price in strong data, the risk is for weaker than anticipated numbers. "The shock aspect would be if the figures were extraordinarily weak in which case you would see yields slip back and that would tend to undermine the dollar," Standard's Fox said. "The irony would be that a rally in bond prices would tend to undermine the dollar because yields would be the focus."
GCAT	The Czech opposition Social Democrats (CSSD), for the second consecutive day, have placed higher in a public opinion poll than the centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS) of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The survey of 1,578 Czechs in May by the private STEM agency released on Thursday put the CSSD on 28.1 percent, its highest poll showing ever, while the ODS was on 20.4 percent, its poorest result ever. The results of the survey come after a similar poll by the state-funded IVVM agency on Wednesday had the CSSD on 25 percent and Klaus's ODS on 18 percent. The three-party governing coalition, however, would still garner 43.8 percent of the vote if an election was held in early May, which would give it 101 of the 200 seats under the proportional seat system used in the lower house of parliament, STEM said. The coalition only won 99 seats in last June elections, but has since regained a majority through opposition defections. Coalition partners, the centrist Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL) and the liberal Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) recorded a 12.0 and 11.4 percent support respectively. The combined opposition, including the Social Democrats, unreformed Communists and far-right Republicans, would get 42.7 percent of the vote. The two surveys are the first since the government announced a package of pro-growth measures on April 16 to help stimulate the economy and ease pressures brought about by a growing trade deficit. General elections are not due until mid-2000, but many analysts have said the government would probably fall before then. -- Jan Lopatka, Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003
MCAT	The Russian Trading System 24-share index surged seven percent to a record 247.69 on record trading volume for the whole market of $58.23 million on Friday, the NAUFOR brokers association said.   Many leading shares recorded double-digit percentage gains in a highly volatile market as foreign investors poured money into Russia despite President Boris Yeltsin's latest health problems, dealers said. Utility Mosenergo ended at $1.41, off an intrasession high of $1.53 but well up on Thursday's closing $1.26. Utility Irkutskenergo rose to $0.195 from Thursday's $0.170. It leapt to $0.220 during the afternoon after confirming it planned to issue American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) this month. Oil company Surgutneftegaz, which will launch its ADRs on Monday, rose to $0.615 from $0.575, off a high of $0.635. Companies which have issued ADRs, which allow foreign investors to buy shares while avoiding domestic settlement problems, have tended to outperform the market. LUKoil rose to $14.25 from $13.10.   Dealers said there were signs of a correction towards the end of trading, although it was unclear whether this would continue next week. "There's a correction on the market. Let's see what happens on Monday," said United City Bank dealer Dmitry Yevenko. "If there's an inflow of new funds, prices will rise again," he said, attributing today's gains to position-building by western operators already here anticipating fresh money. Creditanstalt-Grant dealer Andrei Galperin said the launch of Surgutneftegaz's ADRs on Monday could fuel a new rise. Other dealers attributed Friday's rise to new money from western investors as well as position-covering by locals. Alfa-Kapital dealer Mikhail Khaleyev noted the gains were concentrated in the most liquid "blue chip" stocks, while second tier shares had risen much less. "This was probably because it was new investors, who mainly take traditional stocks," he said. --Olga Popova, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
ECAT	Malaysia's inflation rate in 1997 is expected to be contained below four percent, Bank Negara said in its 1996 annual report on Friday. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, grew by 3.5 percent in 1996, mainly fuelled by food price rises, the central bank report said. "The moderate increase in prices during 1996 also reflected low import prices as a result of low inflation abroad, the appreciation of the ringgit and the abolition of import duties on a wide range of items in the 1996 budget," it said. -- Kuala Lumpur newsroom (603-201 4813)
ECAT	All is not what it seems in the Russian economy, where poor output figures hide a booming black economy and firms play down success for fear of paying tax. Ministers lobby in public for the 1997 budget draft but say privately the plans are unrealistic. Companies earning billions of dollars are threatened with bankruptcy and the government is crying out for cash. "We all know that the Russian economy is not booming by any stretch of the imagination but I am not sure that it is in the state of decline that the official statistics suggest," said one Western economist. The official figures -- dubbed a virtual economy by some analysts -- show that tight monetary policies of the last two years have dragged inflation down and ended the rouble's roller-coaster ride. But the International Monetary Fund, worried about lower than expected tax collection, has postponed paying tranches of a $10 billion three-year loan and the government has threatened to declare tax debtors bankrupt to force them to pay. Companies under threat of bankruptcy have included several major firms in the crucial energy sector and car giant Avtovaz, Russia's fifth biggest employer with 114,000 workers. Analysts say Russian statistics have improved since experts started using Western methods to assess growth, inflation and other indicators, but even Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin admits he does not know the size of the untaxed shadow economy. "The specialists cannot say exactly how much of the economy is in the grey zone," Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying. "The spread is from 20 to 50 percent." Official figures, reassessed after World Bank complaints that statisticians were ignoring the grey economy, say it accounts for 22 percent of gross domestic product. "The statistics are better than they used to be, but they have still got problems," said Roland Nash, chief economist at Renaissance Capital. "They do not pick up the grey economy as much as they should and even the State Statistics Committee gets confused because there are different figures for industrial output for large and medium sized enterprises and for the economy as a whole." Analysts said new problems would emerge next year unless the government and parliament reach a deal on the 1997 budget, due to be discussed next week. Communists and liberals have criticised the plan. "The budget is absolutely unacceptable to us," Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko political movement said on Thursday. "Economic policy is erroneous and incomplete...we are falling ever deeper into an economic crisis." The view is backed, at least in part, by Economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin who said urgent action was needed to propel Russia towards growth. "If the existing trends in the economy are continued without energetic efforts to...create real conditions for growth, the situation will in all probability continue to get worse," Yasin wrote in a letter to Chernomyrdin. "Growth is...totally imperative for survival and for economic and political stability." Yasin, outlining industrial policy for 1997, said Russia would give subsidies and investment funds to some key industries but would tell others to stand on their own feet. Analysts said Yasin's industrial policy could increase pressure on ministers to follow an inflationary course, but said there were few signs that the government was ready to throw away the gains brought by two years of high interest rates. Year-on-year inflation -- 27.2 percent in October -- is at its lowest level since Russian economic reforms began. But industrial output, which has halved over the same period, fell four percent in the year to October. Ministers have denied they will print money to help industry recover and say policy will target the need for low inflation. Officials plan to hold the rouble within a so-called sloping corridor for the whole of next year, allowing the rouble a steady, but gentle daily decline. "The decision...means the question of mass issue of money...is evidently ruled out as a practical policy," Finance Minister Alexander Livshits said when he announced the plans.
GCAT	The Lima hostage crisis reached its three-month milestone on Monday with prospects still distant for an end to the grueling ordeal for 72 dignitaries held under the gun by Peru's Marxist rebels. In a short speech on the 90th day of the siege, President Alberto Fujimori had little to offer his country beyond lamenting the captives' plight as a "terrible situation." Families of the hostages holed up in the besieged Japanese ambassador's residence staged a day of solidarity, including a noisy nationwide demonstration at midday. In a chaotic cacophany outside the residence, car owners set off their alarms, neighbours came out to bang pots, pans and bottles, and demonstrators blew whistles and chanted. In the surrounding San Isidro neighbourhood -- as throughout Peru -- churches held special masses and rang bells in a sign of support for the captives. Motorists in Lima sounded horns, and legislators came out of Congress to hold a minute's silence in a nearby square before applauding and shouting for the hostages' freedom. "I hope that inside they all feel that we are with them, that we love them," said Beatriz de Gumucio, wife of captive Bolivian ambassador Jorge Gumucio, outside the residence. "I am moved by the displays of solidarity. The whole of Peru has united for this group of 72 dignified people," said Luisa Aguilar, wife of captive judge Hugo Sivina. "I am sure that the terrorists have heard us and realised that there is no room for them in this country. Nobody is with them." Some of the hostages responded by raising hands to a window sandwiched between a rebel flag and a banner railing against Fujimori. One of them waved a white handkerchief. An open letter from the families described the time since the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) takeover of the diplomatic compound as "three months of agony and suffering." More than 500 hostages were taken on Dec. 17 when some 20 jungle-trained rebels blew a hole in the residence's outer wall, swarmed into the building in a fierce shootout and took control. But the MRTA gradually released most of its prisoners, keeping those it considered most valuable as bargaining chips in its central aim of freeing some 400 jailed comrades. The remaining captives -- top diplomats, security chiefs, ministers, judges and businessmen -- are mainly middle-aged and increasingly ailing, intelligence and medical reports say. Stress, gum diseases and skin ailments are common. The hostages have already passed Christmas and New Year inside the cramped building with the windows closed and no air conditioning despite the hot Lima summer. They look likely to spend Easter there, too. "The basic problem is now almost the same as 90 days ago -- how to deal with the demand for freedom of MRTA prisoners. No political way to deal with this has yet been found," former captive and opposition legislator Javier Diez Canseco, released in the early days of the crisis, told Reuters. "I think of the hostages every day, of what they are going through," he added. Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar sent a greeting to Gumucio and called for the three-month milestone to be used as a time for reflection. "Ninety days is too much. However, there is no short-term solution in sight," he said in a phone conversation from La Paz with a local radio station. Members of a three-man guarantors commission overseeing negotiations between the government and rebels were expected to meet later Monday with MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa and his second-in-command Rolly Rojas, local radio said. The guarantors are meeting separately with the MRTA and government negotiator Domingo Palermo in an effort to pave the way for a negotiated solution after 10 rounds of face-to-face talks apparently brought little more than a polite exchange of divergent positions. Pollster Apoyo S.A. released a survey showing that more than half of Peruvians believed the crisis -- already Latin America's longest hostage siege -- would take at least one month more to resolve. Thirty-three percent of those surveyed believed the crisis would last another one to three months, while 20 percent thought it would take more than three months.
CCAT	Peru's state mining company Centromin said Monday it had set a minimum price of $8 million for the privatization in December of its polymetallic unit Empresa Minera Yauliyacu SA. Centromin added in a statement that the winner of the auction will also have to invest a minimum of $15 million over five years, as well as assume an additional cost of $4.05 million over two years to treat abandoned deposits. Centromin said it will accept offers for the unit on December 2, and will announce the auction winner on December 6. Yauliyacu, based in the province of Huarochiri, 75 miles (120 km) east of Lima, includes an underground mine and a concentrating plant with capacity to treat 979,000 tonnes of mineral per year. Centromin has said the unit has proven and probable reserves of silver, zinc, lead and copper totalling 7.3 million tonnes. The unit's potential reserves total 14.7 million tonnes. In 1995, 746,000 tonnes of mineral were extracted from the site. Centromin said earlier this month at least eight local and "many" foreign miners were interested in the auction of Yauliyacu. -- Andrew Cawthorne, Lima newsroom, 511 221-2134
ECAT	Guatemala's export revenues in the first quarter of 1997 rose 45 percent over the same time period in 1996, the central bank said Tuesday. Export revenues were $986 million through April 10 this year, compared with $681 million through April 11 last year. "In 1997 there has been an upturn in foreign currency revenues from exports, principally as a result of the rise in coffee sales and the rise in prices for that product," Willy Zapata, president of Banco de Guatemala, told Reuters.   Zapata said foreign currency spending on imports in the first quarter this year rose 42 percent compared with the same period last year. Spending on imports was $969 million through April 10, 1997 compared with $682 million through April 13, 1996. The trade surplus was $17 million for the first quarter of this year compared to a deficit of $1.0 million in the first three months of 1996. (Corrects to make clear year ago first quarter was a deficit, not a surplus). International reserves have grown $150 million "as a result of official and private capital income," to $966 million on April 16 from $815 million on December 31, Zapata said.   Zapata said the bank has not adjusted since January its projection for Guatemala's economic growth this year, which is for growth between 4.2 percent and five percent. Gross domestic product grew 3.1 percent in 1996, the lowest growth rate for the country during the 1990s and well below projections of four to five percent. Guatemala's central bank inaugurated last week a Spanish- language Web page with up-to-date macroeconomic indicators as well as historic data back through 1950. The internet address for the web page is www.banguat.gob.gt, Zapata said. ((--Fiona Ortiz, Guatemala City bureau +502 251-5718))
CCAT	Malaysia will officially unveil its national motorcycle on Thursday, capping another milestone in the country's industrialisation plan of making vehicles with foreign help, industry analysts said on Wednesday. The motorcycle launch follows the 13-year success of the popular Proton cars, which have since been joined by a second Malaysian-made car and two national van projects. The Southeast Asian country, which aims to be an industrialised nation by 2020, has also announced plans to build made-in-Malaysia buses and trucks. "To industrialise, you need more than manufacturing. Like the developed countries, you need heavy industries which provide jobs, transfer of technology," said Irene Tan, research manager at investment house Vickers Ballas Research. Tan Geok Hock, a Schroder Research analyst, said: "If you're doing cars already, motorcycles and vans are not a quantum leap. They're just a natural progression." Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, key proponent of the vehicle projects, will launch the 110 cc motorcycle at a plant in Gurun, in his northern home state of Kedah.   Like other Malaysian-made vehicles, foreign partnerships are the key, analysts said. The motorcycle's manufacturer, Motosikal dan Enjin Nasional Sdn Bhd (Modenas), is a 600 million ringgit ($240 million) joint venture between two Malaysian and two Japanese partners. Malaysian automotive group Diversified Resources Bhd has a 55 percent stake, the federal government's investment agency Khazanah Nasional 15 percent, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd 19 percent, and Nissho-Iwai Corp 11 percent. Modenas officials said they expect the motorcycle to be priced under 4,000 ringgit ($1,600) with first-year production of 100,000 units. Analysts are expecting brisk sales due to its competitive pricing. "If they price it below 4,000 ringgit, I think it will do well," said an auto analyst at stockbrokers WI Carr (Malaysia), who declined to be named. He said similar imported motorcycles are priced from 4,100 to 4,500 ringgit. Modenas' main shareholder, Diversified Resources or DRB, is experienced at vehicle production and marketing.   DRB, owned by Malaysian Yahaya Ahmad, controls the country's first national car maker, Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton), through heavy industrial group Hicom Holdings Bhd. Cars made by Proton dominate the local vehicle market, accounting for about 53 percent of sales in the first half of 1996. Proton makes the cars with help from its Japanese partner, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Proton and French company Automobiles Citroen, also jointly produce the smaller Proton Tiara car. Malaysia's second national car company, Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sdn Bhd (Perodua), has Japanese partners in Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd and Mitsui & Co Ltd. Perodua makes a sub-compact car and a national van. Last month, three Malaysian companies, including Berjaya Group Bhd, joined Korea's Hyundai Motor Co Ltd and France's Renault SA to build a heavy-duty van and a light truck. DRB, Hicom and Japan's Isuzu Motors Ltd are also planning to build trucks and buses locally. -- Kuala Lumpur newsroom (603-201 4813) ($1 = 2.50 ringgit)

GCAT	Iran said on Sunday 400 more Iraqi Kurdish refugees had crossed into its territory, joining tens of thousands who have fled northern Iraq since its takeover by a Baghdad-backed Kurdish faction in September. "The latest batch of refugees brings to 10,400 the number of Iraqi refugees settled in Bashmaq refugee camp," said Ali Yari, governor of Iran's northwestern Marivan province, as quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA. IRNA said the refugees had crossed the border on Saturday. Bashmaq is one of seven refugee camps in three Iranian provinces sheltering some 42,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees, said Laurens Jolles, an official of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Tehran.

CCAT	The Netherlands' national airport at Schiphol could be moved to a man-made island in the North Sea, a report by the Dutch national resources and demographics institute(RPD) said on Friday. It added that an artificial island is the most logical location for a new national airport. The report was prepared for the Dutch planning ministry. The RPD said moving Schiphol would avoid the need for a second national airport. The report is intended as an advisory document ahead of a review of airport capacity due in to start in March next year. The proposal is one way of achieving improved long term growth for the airport and of reducing environmental objections to further expansion of the existing airport, it added. The report also examined a number of other options including boosting current capacity at Schiphol, the construction of a satellite airport and a third option, of building a second national airport offshore. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017

MCAT	A groundswell of optimism that a deal on the key EU budget stability pact was in sight robbed the mark of the gains it had made since France cast doubt over the whole EMU project early this week. Satellite currencies sank against the mark after France said on Monday that it needed more time to study the pact, which is due to be ratified at next week's EU summit in Amsterdam. But after talks with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and President Jacques Chirac on Thursday, European Commission President Jacques Santer said "all elements are on the table" to enable French ratification of the pact. Jospin said his new Socialist government's concerns on Europe had been understood and progress was being made. EU Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy said he believed Europe would be able to reach a deal in Amsterdam, by making more explicit reference to the need to coordinate economic policies across Europe and fight to reduce unemployment. The mark was trading at 982.70/10 Italian lire and 3.3761/66 French francs at 1431 GMT. That was well below Wednesday's European closes of 986.05/55 and 3.3822/27 and compared with levels of 986.00/30 and 3.3763/66 last Friday -- before France's bombshell triggered a flight into marks. Analysts said the apparent move towards agreement on the stability pact -- aimed at enforcing budgetary discipline after EMU begins -- had persuaded the market that the political will to launch the euro on time was undimmed. "This is what's encouraging people to take a much more sanguine view on the mark crosses and to go back to the old convergence trend, particularly for the likes of Italy and Spain," said Stephen Hannah, director of research at IBJ. The Spanish peseta firmed to 84.53/55 per mark from late Wednesday's 84.58/60, above last Friday's 84.57/59 close. Concern that EMU could be delayed tends to buoy the mark as players see the risk recede that it will be subsumed into a weaker single currency. On the other hand, talk of a broad-based first wave of EMU, encompassing countries such as Italy and Spain, usually has the opposite effect as the market weighs up the prospect that the German unit will give way to a softer euro. This month's election victory for the French left wing -- which wants to see a broad start to EMU -- has stoked fears of a weak euro, as have Germany's difficulties in plugging its budget holes to qualify for monetary union. Bonn's controversial proposal to revalue gold and currency assets fuelled those concerns as the market fretted that Germany was looking to fudge the EMU entry criteria, opening the way for "creative accounting" by other aspiring participants. The Bundesbank, which has sharply attacked the government's revaluation plans, today welcomed efforts to resolve its row with Bonn and said it hoped for a compromise soon. The market's conviction that political will would override economic realities was reflected in its impassive reaction to a report from the OECD, which predicted that Germany, France and Italy would all miss the EMU deficit target this year. In its economic outlook, the OECD forecast 1997 deficit/GDP ratios of 3.2 percent for those countries, above the 3.0 percent limit laid down in the Maastricht Treaty on monetary union. The report predicted Germany and France would see their deficits fall to 2.7 and 3.0 percent respectively in 1998, but Italy's budget gap was forecast to widen to 3.8. The market will be keeping a close eye on the Franco-German summit in the western French city of Poitiers on Friday, ahead of the Amsterdam summit on June 16-17. -- Abigail Levene, London Newsroom +44-171-542-8968
MCAT	The Croatian call money market rate rose on Monday morning and dealers said tight accounts made it difficult to find funds for banks with shortages. "The overall lack (of funds) has now entered its third day and it can now be felt in the price of capital," dealer Jasenka Blagaic said, but was unable to give a reason for the shortage. She said the average money market rate rose to 10.68 percent by 0900 GMT, pushed up mainly by higher call money rates, mixed at 10.5, 11 and 14 percent. "Morning trade was very hard," said Blagaic, adding a total of 37.9 million deals were settled, leaving a shortage of 17 million in demand. Of this, 23.1 million were fresh funds, while 14.8 million accounted for funds borrowed over the weekend. Smaller ammounts in three- and four-day term deals were struck at 10.5 percent and seven-day at 11 percent. Overnight trade over the weekend was also strained, with bank accounts halved compared with Thursday, while several banks borrowed funds from Friday to Monday. -- Metka Jelenc, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075
ECAT	A Chinese vice minister has urged South Korean businessmen to invest more in China's less developed central and western regions, the International Business Daily said on Thursday. Vice Foreign Trade Minister Liu Shan said South Korean businessmen would likely invest $3.0 billion in China in 1996, the newspaper said. He gave no comparative figures. Two-way trade was expected to hit $20.0 billion this year, Liu said, adding that there was still much potential. He did not give a breakdown for imports and exports. He told a group of visiting South Korean officials on Wednesday that Seoul should open its markets further to Chinese products, especially agricultural goods. Liu also urged South Korea to cut tariffs and remove non-tariff barriers. South Korea enjoyed a surplus of $3.86 billion with China in the first 10 months of 1996, according to Chinese statistics.
GCAT	German teenager Tommy Haas, semifinalist at the German Open, has been given a special invitation to play at next week's Italian Open. Haas, 19, left school less than a year ago and entered the Hamburg tournament as a wildcard. On Friday the 123rd-ranked player beat Spain's 11th seed Alberto Berasategui 2-6 6-3 6-3 to defeat his second seeded opponent in four days. Italian Open organisers gave five wild cards to local players Andrea Gaudenzi, Omar Camporese, Marzio Martelli, Stefano Pescosolido and Diego Nargiso. The men's tournament starts at the clay court Foro Italico on Monday.
GCAT	Roelf Meyer, estranged ally of former South African president F.W. de Klerk, said on Wednesday he was forming a new political movement to challenge the ruling ANC and the National Party, which he quit at the weekend. "I am announcing today the establishment of a New Movement Process (NMP)," he told a news conference in Pretoria, saying he hoped the movement would grow into a party to fight the 1999 elections and change the new South Africa's political landscape. An architect of South Africa's post-apartheid politics of reconciliation, Meyer resigned on Saturday from the former ruling National Party (NP) and from parliament after a dispute with de Klerk over the party's political future. He played a crucial role in negotiating the peaceful handover of power in 1994 from white rule, but has effectively been sidelined by NP right-wingers who see him as too liberal. Meyer had wanted the party to disband before seeking to build a broad, moderate alliance to challenge President Nelson Mandela's ruling African National Congress. He said his new movement would have the role of such an alliance and would approach all sorts of people to try and become a viable political party to fight the dominant ANC. "The people of South Africa are yearning for a new politial organisation that will in fact leave the old order behind. At the moment all political parties are still of that old order," he said. "What this country needs is a successful competitor at national level. We must establish an alternative to government which can become a government of the future." Meyer said he would be tough on crime and push ahead to improve health and education for the country's poor. The ANC still enjoys the mass support it won as a liberation movement to fight the NP's apartheid regime. It won just under two-thirds of the vote in the historic all-race polls three years ago and is virtually certain of victory next time round. Its dominance of the political scene has led opponents to warn that South Africa could become a de facto one-party state. Meyer said in his efforts to prevent that, he would pursue his talks with the small white-led Democratic Party and with Bantu Holomisa, a popular politician thrown out of the ANC this year for disagreeing with its leaders. Holomisa has already formed a similar movement which he said he hopes to turn into a political party. The National Party, which won a fifth of the vote in 1994, was formed as an unashamedly white nationalist group and started implementing apartheid after winning power in 1948. Despite many efforts since the early 1990s, it has had difficulty altering its old image, especially among the blacks it is trying to woo. Most of its voters are whites or mixed-race people, many of whom who fear domination by the black majority.
ECAT	Algeria's non-energy exports reached $688 million in the first 10 months of 1996, Finance Minister Abdelkrim Harchaoui said on Monday. Harchaoui made the announcement while addressing Algeria's National Transitional Council -- the country's quasi-parliament, the official Algerian news agency reported. The council is examining the government's 1997 draft budget, already approved by the cabinet.   "Algeria's non-energy exports reached $688 million during the first ten months of the year," APS quoted Harchaoui as saying. It gave no comparative figures for the year-earlier period. Non-energy exports went to 28 countries during the January to October period. Exports to Russia represented 50 percent of the total, "in the framework of repayment of Algeria's debt," APS said without providing further details. About 33 percent of the total went to the European Union. Algeria, a member of OPEC, relies on oil and natural gas sales for nearly 95 percent of its foreign income. Much of its state-owned industry outside the energy sector operates at less than 50 percent of capacity. The government's budget assumes $11.1 billion in income from hydrocarbon exports next year.
CCAT	Ryerson Tull Inc, a metal distributor and processor, said Monday its gross profit per ton fell to $212 in the first quarter from $232 a year ago, reflecting weak industry-wide metals prices. Earlier, Ryerson reported first quarter net income of $16.6 million or $0.42 a share, down from year-ago results of $22.4 million or $0.57 a share. Ryerson said its first-quarter market share rose to an estimated 9.7 percent from 9.2 percent a year ago, based on Steel Service Center Institute data. "This market share growth, combined with strong service center industry shipment levels, produced an 11 percent increase in tons shipped," Neil Novich, president, said in a statement. First quarter expenses per ton dropped to $165 from $175 a year ago, he added. Volume gains and cost control efforts, however, were offset by the decline in the gross profit, Ryerson said.

ECAT	British exporters, battered by the strength of sterling, are less confident than at any time since October 1993, courier company DHL said on Monday. DHL's quarterly export indicator showed the downturn in confidence started last summer when the pound started to soar. It has now risen by about 17 percent since August 1996, pushing export prices higher as it has climbed. "Exporters are expressing grave concern at the effect of sterling's strength on both short-term and long-term business prospects," Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export said. The survey found two-thirds of exporters said exchange rates will have a negative impact on sales in the next three months. Given that the last nine months has showed graphically how currency volatility can hurt exporters, it is perhaps not surprising that DHL's survey showed almost 60 percent of the 800 exporters it talked to favour British membership of a single European currency. Some 58 percent said joining European economic and monetary union would help them. In November, only 54 percent took that line. DHL said larger companies were much keener on Britain joining EMU that smaller ones. Campbell said industry had broadly welcomed Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's decision to grant the Bank of England independence to set interest rates. But he said the new monetary committee must take a global view. "Recent history indicates the Bank would have preferred rates to be raised sooner, and to higher levels," he said. "If maintained, this myopic view does not bode well for the exchange rate in the short-term. The new monetary committee needs to take a global perspective." In terms of Britain's global trade standing, DHL, its main owners flagcarriers Lufthansa and JAL, said exporters rate both China and Taiwan as more powerful in world markets. Britain is seen on a par with South Korea but ahead of Italy and France. -- Mike Peacock, London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109
ECAT	Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud Zu'bi arrived in Jakarta on Thursday on a four-day official visit to discuss economic and trade relations between the two countries. "The focus of the visit is mainly to seek ways to expand economy and to boost trade," Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told Reuters shortly after Zu'bi paid a brief courtesy call on Indonesian President Suharto. "There is also the possibility to discuss developments in the Middle East," he added. Zu'bi is scheduled to hold official talks with Suharto on Friday before visiting the state-owned aircraft industry PT Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) in Bandung, West Java, on Saturday. He will visit the holiday isle of Bali before returning to Syria on Sunday.
MCAT	The FTSE 100 index will lack sufficient pace to take it above 4,675 on the upside, technical analysts said. Aggressive strides to higher levels, expected earlier in the week have now developed into a plod after a restrained performance by the gilts market, they added. "With Wall Street being similarly held back as well as a long weekend to follow, the envoronment is not one in which the FTSE can easily romp ahead," said one analyst. By 0731 GMT, the FTSE was up 1.7 at 4,653.5.   Turnover in UK equities is likely to tail off later in the day as investor attention focuses more on the forthcoming three day holiday weekend. But in the meantime, the fact that the FTSE has managed to make higher intra-day lows over the past three days offers hope to market bulls that at least 4,620 is a reasonably secure support area for the short-term. "It may have difficulty going too far above its 10 day moving average and the market could fall back a little if this is not successfully overcome," one analyst said. On Thursday, the FTSE's 10 day moving average was at 4,660.   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 32.56 at 7,258.13 on Thursday. -- Pradip Mishra, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7954
CCAT	A U.S. bankruptcy court granted Montgomery Ward Holding Co. a temporary restraining order blocking rival Sears, Roebuck and Co. from recruiting employees from the ailing retailer's management ranks, Montgomery Ward said Tuesday. The order, which prohibits Sears from approaching, contacting or soliciting for employment any current management employee of Montgomery Ward, was granted Monday by a bankruptcy court in Delaware. The order stemmed from a motion by Montgomery Ward alleging predatory recruiting practices by Sears. The motion alleged Sears had engaged in conduct designed to "hasten the weakening state of Montgomery Ward" and "make it even more difficult for (Ward) to do business," Montgomery Ward said in a statement. Chicago-based Montgomery Ward filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month after talks with lenders to restructure its debt and obtain new financing fell apart. The 125-year-old department store chain racked up losses worth $249 million in 1996. Sears said its corporate policy discourages recruiting employees from struggling competitors. "Despite the fact that we are in a competitive business, we have a crystal clear policy on matters such as this," said Sears spokesman Ron Culp. "If this indeed happened, it was against these guidelines and we will take appropriate actions to see this doesn't happen again," he said, adding, "We will also reissue the policy today." Culp said the policy sets forth guidelines for when a competitor is failing. In dealing with job applicants, "It lets them contact us," and cautions against being overly zealous or overly aggressive in pursuing employees at another company, he said. Montgomery Ward alleged that a Sears "Action Plan" was distributed via electronic mail to Sears field locations and targeted specific key positions in recruiting efforts designed solely to hurt Montgomery Ward's business. It told Sears personnel to be "extremely predatory" in their methods, Ward said. Montgomery Ward said Sears human resource representatives began systematically contacting Montgomery Ward personnel in targeted jobs, and recruiters were told to keep a headcount of how many people they could hire away. "Obviously, our first priority is to fix our business and we believe that we can compete with any retailer in a fair business environment. However, based on this 'Action Plan' we believe that Sears has crossed the line between healthy competition and unethical activities," said Montgomery Ward Chairman Roger Goddu. Montgomery Ward is the largest privately held retailer in the United States, currently operating a chain of 400 stores in 43 states. After a planned closing of its speciality stores, Montgomery Ward will operate 356 stores in 39 states.
CCAT	Weatherford Enterra Inc said Thursday that it has named Thomas Bates president and chief executive officer. Bates, said the company,  will also become a member of the company's board of directors. Weatherford said he is expected to join the company on June 1.  Bates, who is 47 years old, previously spent 15 years at Schlumberger Limited, most recently serving as president of Schlumberger's Anadrill subsidiary since 1992. He suceeds an interim chief executive, Thomas Amonett, who held the positions after CEO and president Philip Burguieres, now chairman, relinquished them in October, 1996. Weatherford Enterra is a diversified international energy service and manufacturing company.
GCAT	Japan's new Democratic Party had a lead over the main opposition party in a poll published on Wednesday but both trailed the main government party. A survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, found 7.8 percent willing to vote for the Democratic Party, which will be formed later this month, while only 6.5 percent said they would vote for Shinshinto. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) scored the highest, with 22.4 percent. An overwhelming 49.4 percent of those polled said they were still undecided on which party to vote for. The survey covered 3,000 people nationwide over the weekend. Hashimoto is widely expected to call snap elections next month. The Democratic Party, to be headed by Yukio Hatoyama, former member of the smallest coalition partner Sakigake, and Health Minister Naoto Kan, hopes to group liberal forces from, among others, Sakigake and the Social Democratic Party, the two other members of the ruling coalition. Sakigake scored just 1.2 percent in the poll, the SDP 3.7 percent, communists 2.6 percent, others 1.7 percent and 4.7 percent did not respond. Meanwhile, support for Hashimoto's cabinet was largely unchanged at 41.0 percent, down only 0.5 percentage point from the previous poll conducted in June.
ECAT	China and Nepal were expected to sign an agreement to boost economic cooperation during the first visit by a Chinese president to the Himalayan kingdom in 12 years, officials said on Monday. Jiang Zemin was scheduled to arrive in Nepal's capital of Kathmandu from Pakistan on Wednesday as the guest of King Birendra, the world's only Hindu monarch. King Birendra visited China in August. Jiang, who was set to meet Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and the leader of the communist United Marxist-Leninist (UML) party, Man Mohan Adhikary, was expected to sign an accord to strengthen bilateral economic ties, officials said. Nepal's trade defict with China widened to $52.9 million in the 1994/95 financial year, which ended in mid-July 1995, up from $43.8 million the previous year. Many Nepali businessmen eye neighbouring Tibet as a promising market. "Nepal can be an ideal place to supply many, many products required in Tibet for its development construction," said Padma Jyoti, president of the Federation of the Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Nepal, which liberalised its economy in 1992, has invited Chinese investment in water resources and tourism. A Chinese business delegation in October discussed possible joint ventures in hydropower, pharmaceuticals, cement, poultry farming, garments and sport shoes with Nepal. The kingdom tightened security in anticipation of possible demonstrations by Tibetan exiles. "We will not allow any anti-China activities in our soil," senior Foreign Ministry official Janak Bahadur Singh. Some 20,000 exiled Tibetans live in Nepal. Kathmandu, sandwiched between China to the north and India to the south, recognises China's sovereignty over Tibet and bows to Beijing's sensitivities over Taiwan. China has governed the deeply religious Himalayan region of Tibet since its People's Liberation Army marched into Lhasa in 1950. In early 1995, Nepal, fearing a possible objection from Beijing, refused to allow a planned peace march by Tibetans through Nepal from Dharmasala in northern India to Lhasa. The march was later called off by the Tibetan exiles. Last month, at least two Tibetans fleeing their homeland were injured when Nepali police fired at them in a remote village in the Himalayan kingdom. Jiang's visit to Nepal will be the third leg of a week-long trip to South Asia. Last Friday, during Jiang's three-day visit to India, China and India signed an agreement aimed at reducing tensions along their Himalayan border where they fought a war in 1962. In Islamabad on Sunday, Jiang discussed the continuation of peaceful nuclear cooperation with Pakistan during a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart, Farooq Leghari.
GCAT	Atletico Madrid signed Brazilian midfielder Juninho for $20.2 million from English first division club Middlesbrough on Tuesday. The move ended weeks of speculation about Juninho's future after Middlesbrough were relegated from the premier league at the end of last season. "I am very disappointed that we have not been able to keep Juninho because he had a very special relationship with us," Keith Lamb, Middlesbrough's chief executive told BBC Radio Five. But Middlesbrough cannot be too sad. Having bought Juninho for $7.6 million in 1995, they have made a handsome profit, although his inspiration and brilliant ball-skills will be badly missed. An 11 million pound ($18.5 million) deal had been agreed with premier league club Tottenham but Juninho, 24, was known to prefer a move to Spain where greater exposure on Brazilian television would increase his chances of selection for the 1998 World Cup finals. "Atletico first showed an interest in signing me about two or three months ago," the Brazilian said on Tuesday. "They are an ambitious club and one of the biggest clubs in Spain and the Spanish league is shown in Brazil every weekend." Under the terms of the deal, Juninho will remain with the Spanish club for five years. The deal also contracts Atletico to play two games against Middlesbrough at their Riverside stadium over the next two seasons. "Finally we've achieved what I and everyone at Atletico wanted," Atletico's managing director Miguel Angel Gil told Spanish state television. Small in stature but big in heart, Juninho helped Middlesbrough to two cup finals last season. But both ended in defeat and an extraordinary season was capped when the club was relegated, to the distress of the thousands of fans -- and Juninho himself. Voted, Brazilian Player of the Year in 1994, Juninho scored on his international debut in February 1995 in Brazil's 5-0 win over Slovakia, although he is currently out of the squad. In November 1995, he signed for Middlesbrough for a then club-record fee of 4.5 million pounds ($7.6 million). Last season he played in 34 of Middlesbrough's 38 league matches, scoring 12 times and adding another three cup goals. ($ = 0.594 British Pounds)

GCAT	Olympic gold medallist Carl Lewis has told organisers of a prize-giving ceremony in Spain he will not be able to attend because he has lost his passport, an official said on Friday. "As I was getting ready to board the airplane in New York I discovered that I had lost my passport," Lewis told the Prince of Asturias foundation in a fax sent on Friday. The state department did not authorise him to board the plane, the athlete added. Lewis said he deeply regretted not being able to collect the award, which meant a lot to him because it recognised not only his sporting achievements but also his fight against drugs in sport. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and former Spanish prime minister Adolfo Suarez will be among those attending the annual awards ceremony in the northern city of Oviedo on Friday night. Kohl has been awarded the foundation's international co-operation prize for his role in reducing arms in Europe in the 1980s, reunifying Germany and promoting European economic and monetary union. The Prince of Asturias prize was founded in 1980 and named after the Spanish royal heir. Winners receive a statue by Catalan artist Joan Miro, a certificate and a cash prize. Past winners include King Hussein of Jordan who won the Prince of Asturias peace prize in 1995. Slain Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin shared the same prize with Palestinian President (then PLO chairman) Yasser Arafat the previous year.
ECAT	Brazilian inflation between February 21 and March 20 accelerated to 1.15 percent, against 0.43 percent between January 21 and February 20 as measured by the IGP-M index released by the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV). The IGP-M is composed of three other economic indicators. They are the IPA wholesale price index, which rose 1.62 percent in the period, the IPC consumer price index, which advanced 0.63 percent in the period, and the INCC national index of construction costs, which gained 0.42 percent. The IPA has a 60 percent weighting in the IGP-M, the IPC a 30 percent weighting and the INCC 10 percent, the FGV said.

CCAT	Applications for shares in the public offer for sale (OPV) of Portuguese cement producer Cimpor outstripped supply almost fivefold at the end of pre-registration, a source familiar with the process said. The source said on Monday applications for more than 75 million shares had been received at the end of pre-registration last Friday for the 16 million available in the OPV. "The strong demand is due to the financial solidity of the group and falling interest rates," the source told Reuters. Lisbon bourse will announce the results of the privatisation of a 45 percent stake in Cimpor-Cimentos de Portugal, Portugal's biggest cement producer, on October 15. Portugal's Socialist government plans to sell 16 million shares in the OPV and 18.96 million by direct sale. The OPV is divided into four groups -- employees, small investors and emigrants, existing shareholders (who hold shares acquired before September 6 and retain them until the end of the OPV), and the general public. Cimpor employees have been allocated 600,000 shares, small investors and emigrants 12 million, shareholders 1.2 million and the general public 2.2 million. The previous Social Democrat government sold a 20 percent stake in Cimpor. The total number of shares for sale may be increased by up to 15 percent if there is strong demand in the privatisation. Investors may submit orders this week. An international road show to promote the sale proceeds until next Friday. -- David Brough, Lisbon newsroom +351-1-3538254

CCAT	United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB), an unlisted bank, reported on Friday its group net income rose by 35 percent to 1.809 billion pesos in the first nine months compared with 1.338 billion pesos in the year-ago period. The bank said the high demand for credit boosted its earnings.

MCAT	Dollar/mark ended higher, preserving modest gains posted ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday, but dollar/yen slipped after the impact of a call for a weaker yen by a Japanese official wore off. The dollar continued to recover from a slide to 1.5415 marks in Europe, with traders opting to cover shorts just before the outcome of a meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers was announced at 1414 EST/1914 GMT. In the end, dealers got what they expected when Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee concluded with no change in U.S. interest rates. The dollar closed at 1.5495/05 marks, up from 1.5488/93 at the open. But it slipped to 113.80/90 yen from 114.11/21. The dollar shot above the 114 yen level in overseas trade after the Japanese cabinet member, Kabun Muto, director- general of the Management and Coordination Agency, told reporters in Tokyo that the yen should be "slightly cheaper" to prevent private companies from moving production overseas. "I think the day was really highlighted by talk this morning that a Japanese cabinet member was talking up the dollar/yen," said Bob Near, vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Bank of New York. But Muto, the minister in charge of reforming the Japanese bureaucracy, is not part of the Ministry of Finance, which sets exchange rate policy in Japan. The dollar drifted lower after the ministry reportedly said Muto was speaking for himself, traders noted. "He clearly doesn't have authority on dollar/yen; he was talking to a domestic audience, no doubt," Near added. Traders bought marks and sold dollars in Europe after Otmar Issing, Bundesbank chief economist, criticized measures reached on Friday to prevent European Union (EU) nations from running up budget deficits after Economic and Monetary Union. "It's kind of telling you there could be a confrontation between Bonn and the Bundesbank," said James Powers, vice president of foreign exchange at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in New York. The mark tends to strengthen when the Bundesbank lashes out against the plan to replace the German unit with the euro, which could start off as a weak currency because some of the participating countries are expected to have difficulty maintaining sound fiscal policies after convergence. But the dollar found its footing against the mark after the head of the French central bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, told Reuters Financial Television the market tends to underestimate the economic fundamentals for the dollar. Traders said they construed Trichet's remark as another in a string of recent French calls for a higher dollar. In addition, after weighing on the dollar early in the session, the U.S. stock market helped spur the dollar above 1.55 marks when it moved sharply from the minus to the plus column later in the day, traders said. "On any sign of weakness in stocks, people sell the dollar down and on any signs of strength people buy it back," said Jeffrey Yu, senior dealer at Sanwa Bank in New York. But a slide in U.S. Treasury bonds after a report of a 9.2 percent surge in November U.S. housing starts, the biggest rise since July 1995, did no lasting damage to the dollar. In other trade, the dollar rose to 1.3255/65 Swiss francs from 1.3224/34 at the open but fell to Canadian $1.3627/32 from C$1.3703/08. The pound rose to $1.6712/22 from $1.6668/78 and the Australian dollar rose to $0.7958/63 from $0.7934/39. ((-- Alden Bentley, 212 859 1667))
CCAT	JP Morgan has initiated its coverage of Indonesia's largest cement maker PT Semen Gresik with a "market performer" rating. Morgan said Gresik was fairly valued at current levels, trading at a 13 percent premium to the market in 1996 and a three percent discount in 1997. "The stock has historically traded at an average nine percent discount to the market but we believe it should trade at par, given its solid fundamentals and the expected improving market conditions next year," Tissa Lee of Morgan said. "We therefore initiate coverage of Gresik with a market performer rating and a 12-month target price of 7,780 rupiah," Lee said. Morgan said Gresik had transformed itself into a leading national cement supplier through the acquisition of two cement plants last year, doubling its capacity to 8.5 million tonnes. It said Gresik was now Indonesia's largest cement maker with a capacity of 11.1 million tonnes, surpassing its biggest rival PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa for the first time, after the completion of Tonasa IV this year. "The stock is the most liquid in the sector and its free float was further enlarged following the conversion of rights by the Indonesian government," Lee said.  -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
MCAT	Central Bank cash injections into the Central African CFA franc zone rose in February for a third consecutive month on continuing strong demand to fund commodity marketing seasons, the bank said. Interbank market activity showed a marked increase for the first time since November 1996, as Cameroonian banks returned to the scene after a one-year absence, the Banque des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) added in its monthly bulletin. Total volume of transactions on the monetary market increased by 36.8 percent to 31.6 billion CFA from 23.1 billion in January. February saw four tenders for a total of 92.6 billion CFA, amounting to an average weekly injection of 23.1 billion per tender, compared to 12.8 billion in January. Chad accounted for 81.9 percent of the Central Bank's global bank financing, compared to 8.8 percent for Congo, 7.2 percent for Central African Republic and 2.4 percent for Cameroon. "In Chad, banks drew more on the Central Bank due to the enormous volume of finance needed for the cotton marketing season. Funds doubled between January and February, going from a daily average of 8.6 billion to 17 billion," the bulletin said. On the interbank market, total transactions registered 6.3 billion CFA in February, more than double January's 2.7 billion. The bulletin said two transactions took place on Cameroon's interbank market -- one between a national and foreign bank for five billion CFA for a duration of 28 days with an interest rate of 5.44 percent, one a regional transaction between two institutions in the same group for one billion CFA for a period of 28 days at 7.75 percent. Gabon was the only other country to register any activity on this market. The average interbank rate in February went up slightly to 5.833 percent, from 5.415 percent in January, due to a dip in banks' treasury surpluses. Global bank deposits at the BEAC also rose in February, although there was a variable trend according to each country. Deposits for the zone averaged 75.2 billion CFA in February, up from 64.8 billion CFA in January. Banks in Cameroon retain the highest average daily deposit rate, but this decreased slightly in February at 30.7 billion CFA, against 32.4 billion CFA in January. Bank deposits in the Central African Republic, still trying to recover from its third army mutiny in less than a year, decreased in February to 1.6 billion CFA from 2.4 billion in January and 4.4 billion in December. Banks there channelled reserves into funds for cotton marketing and oil purchases. Gabonese banks again increased deposits, which reached 34.2 billion CFA, against 23.8 billion in January and 21.2 billion in December, as they received advance repayments on loans granted to oil companies. The BEAC indicative money market rates were unchanged with the intervention rate at 7.75 percent and the two to seven day lending rate at 9.75 percent. The Central African monetary zone groups six countries in the region -- Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Chad.

GCAT	Davis Love outdueled British Open champion Justin Leonard in a brilliant final-round performance Sunday to win the PGA Championship by five strokes and claim his first major championship. Love, who began the day tied with Leonard at seven under, a massive seven shots ahead of the rest of the field, was near flawless as he posted five birdies and just one bogey in the pressure-packed showdown at the season's last major. "What a thrill," said Love. "That's the best I ever felt on a golf course for four days with so much pressure." Love, 33, finished with his third four-under-par 66 of the tournament for an 11-under total of 269. As Love walked up the 18th fairway to the cheers of the gallery, a stunning rainbow graced the sky while the sun came out after a sudden downpour had drenched the course. After rolling in a birdie putt to punctuate his triumph, Love hugged his brother and caddie Mark, his wife and his mother in a tearful celebration at the home hole. Love's father, famed teaching pro Davis Love Jr, was killed in a plane crash in 1988. "It's been a long time coming," an emotional Love said after hoisting the silver Wanamaker Trophy. "I've been close a few times, as we all know. I was finding it hard to get through the last three holes without breaking down." Love's maiden major fittingly came at the PGA, the championship of the organization his father belonged to for so many years. "To win this championship was a great thrill for the son of a PGA member," Love said. "I knew he would be especially proud not only because it's a major but also because it's the PGA. He played here in '74 and he played in four or five PGAs." Victory brought Love a first prize of $470,000. Leonard's sensational putting touch deserted him after three impeccable rounds on Winged Foot's greens, and errant drives also gave him trouble. He made four birdies Sunday but had five bogeys as well. Leonard, who set a course record with a five-under-par 65 Saturday, shot 71 to finish at six-under 274. Jeff Maggert won his fight for an automatic berth on the U.S. Ryder Cup team by firing a 65 to finish third at 276. Maggert made six birdies against one bogey to jump past Tommy Tolles into the 10th spot in the Ryder team standings. The only other player to finish under par was Lee Janzen, who led after two rounds. Janzen birdied the last hole for 69 and a one-under 279 total. Alone in fifth was U.S. Ryder Cup captain Tom Kite, who shot 70 for even-par 280. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, playing in one of the day's glamor pairings, both closed with 75s for 286, six over par. Love's 269 total at fabled Winged Foot was spectacular. In four U.S. Opens held at the classic course, the winners shot 294 (Bobby Jones in 1929), 282 (Billy Casper in 1959), 287 (Hale Irwin in 1974) and 276 (Fuzzy Zoeller in 1984). "I'm surprised anyone could shoot so low on this golf course," Love said. "Winged Foot is a very special place. It's incredible to be put in with the other great champions." Leonard, a good friend of Love's, said: "Davis played extremely well today. He never let up. "He's a classy guy, he always has been. That makes up a little bit for my disappointment," added Leonard, who was trying to match Nick Price's 1994 feat of winning two successive majors. Love was solid from the start, hitting fairways, getting it close on approaches and using unerring judgement on the speed of Winged Foot's notoriously fast, sloping greens. Leonard's slide started quickly. At the second hole, Leonard pushed his tee shot into the right rough, punched back into the fairway and took a bogey to end a string of 20 holes of par or better. Love made it a two-stroke lead by curling in a birdie putt at the par-3 third hole. Another bogey by Leonard after driving into the rough at the fourth hole made it a three-shot advantage for Love, who extended that with a birdie tap-in at the par-5 fifth after narrowly missing an eagle putt. After another birdie, Love led by five shots at the turn, but saw his lead cut to three at the 12th, where he bogeyed after finding the rough, while Leonard made birdie to reach seven under par. Leonard's last chance probably came at the 13th. The Texan's tee shot at the par-3 hole gave him a good chance for birdie. Love, meanwhile, sent his tee ball wild left and into deep rough with very little green to work with. Another two-shot swing would have shrunk Love's lead to one, and bogey looked likely for Love. But Love gently lobbed the ball out of the junk and nearly holed it, lipping out of the cup and then tapping in for par. Leonard missed his birdie. The three-shot lead remained. "That's the hole that really saved me," Love said. "It saved the tournament for me." Love, who had posted five top-10s in majors since being runner-up at the 1995 Masters, won going away after that and got rid of the "best player never to win a major" moniker. "I was proud to be put in that category," Love said. "It's also nice to get out of it."

GCAT	Ousted Russian defence minister Igor Rodionov accused President Boris Yeltsin and the government on Friday of destabilising the armed forces by launching "irresponsible" reforms. Rodionov, sacked by Yeltsin in May for failing to make reforms, made his attack two days after Yeltsin signed decrees ordering the reorganisation of the military and reducing troop numbers by 500,000 to 1.2 million by the end of next year. Rodionov denied that a new organisation, set up outside the armed forces to defend the military's interests, would destabilise the army. He is a member of the organisation. "The president and prime minister's political approach to the problem (of military reform) destabilises the situation," he said in an interview published by Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper. "I cannot understand why our leadership is so irresponsible about military reforms. We still have no doctrine, no concept, no programme and, that means, no everyday plans." The armed forces, heavily funded in Soviet times, are now demoralised and in disarray. They were defeated by separatist rebels in Chechnya, many soldiers have not been paid for months, corruption is rife and living conditions are getting worse. Nezavisimaya Gazeta published the interview with Rodionov alongside an article written by the former defence minister in which he appealed to servicemen to be patient. "Ninety-five thousand officers do not have their own place to live. Many live in very difficult conditions -- in railway carriages, garages, tents, their workplaces. It make you ashamed and bitter to acknowledge and see this," he said. Rodionov said Yeltsin was wrong to make military reforms subordinate to overall economic reforms. "Strengthening the economy at the expense of the country's military readiness is adventurism," he wrote. Yeltsin's decrees also ordered the merger of various branches of the armed forces and put restrictions on defence ministry and general staff administration costs. He instructed Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's government to come up with proposals for funding the changes and providing help for servicemen who are discharged.

MCAT	London's October white sugar contract managed to hold on to nearby support at $326 as the market consolidated after last week's rally, traders said on Tuesday. Light commission house buying of October kept the contract propped up, with the strength partially offset by trade against actuals selling. "They look like they might be trying to push the market up a little...but I don't expect too much to happen in London this morning," said one trader. "After the rally on Friday and an inside day yesterday, we're all waiting to see what happens." A burst of fund buying in October raws on Friday gave London's equivalent whites contract a kick higher as the position regained most of the ground lost this month. But on Tuesday activity was generally subdued and volume amounted to just 318 lots by 1120 GMT, concentrated in October. October and December were both down by 20 cents, at $326.20 and $323.50 respectively. Technical analysts said the fact that October had so far held support reflected the consolidation expected after such a strong push higher. A test of October's life-high at $331.00 could now be expected in coming sessions, they said. In physical news, India was reported to have been buyers at the end of last week of up to four cargoes of lesser-quality 100 ICUMSA sugar. Iraq has offered to buy white sugar as part of the U.N.-sponsored oil-for-food deal at $379.50 per tonne c&f Umm Qasr or $420 c&f Baghdad, market sources said. Just 35 lots were posted on the board on the Paris market. October was down 30 cents at $325.70 and December unchanged at $323.50. Nothing was traded on Matif's 100 ICUMSA white sugar market. -- Jeremy Smith, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8064
GCAT	South African President Nelson Mandela responded cautiously to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's proposal for a Western-sponsored African intervention force, which they are due to discuss on Saturday. "Africa would like to feel that they are handling things themselves...not acting in response to suggestions that come from outside the continent," Mandela told Reuters on Thursday. He confirmed that he would meet Christopher in Cape Town on Saturday, but said he would take any peacekeeping proposals to the Southern African Development Community (SADC), of which he is chairman. "It is only by working together through established organisations that we can solve problems. We will not hold back if we are asked by any of these organisations and we have the capacity to do so," he said. U.S. officials said in Addis Ababa on Wednesday that nine African countries had so far endorsed the U.S. initiative to convene an African Crisis Response Force of up to 10,000 troops. Briefing reporters ahead of the Ethiopian leg of Christopher's five-nation African tour, they named only Mali as a supporter of the plan. The United States has undertaken to pay a quarter of the estimated $40 million cost of training a pan-African intervention force and has pledged an additional $10 million. Canada, Britain, Ireland and Belgium have so far promised financial support for the project. The Johannesburg Star newspaper said in an editorial on Thursday it was time for Mandela's post-apartheid government to lend active support to the search for peace on the continent. "We all suffer from the periodic man-made disasters that still plague Africa. The negative image of the continent that they create in the minds of foreign investors rubs off on us. "This may be South Africa's moment to step out of the wings and begin to play its proper role in Africa," the paper said. Mandela has so far resisted both a unilateral diplomatic role in peacemaking initiatives or a military role for his country's defence force, which is still trying to merge the former apartheid army and the liberation forces it fought. "We are concerned not to appear to continue the policies of the previous government, which engaged in military and economic destabilisation of neighbouring states. We are trying to avoid that," he said on Thursday. Mandela broke his own rule on Nigeria by getting ahead of other African leaders with a call for sanctions against the country's military government, which was ignored. He joined neighbouring countries last year in a more successful diplomatic drive for peace in landlocked Lesotho. But political sources close to Mandela said he was resisting pressure from Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to endorse a regional force mandated to intervene in other countries. "Mugabe is pushing hard, in fact he can be quite irritating, but as long as Mandela is president, I think the current policy will hold," one source said. A U.S. diplomatic source said Christopher probably would put the drive for democracy in Nigeria and the search for a successor to Boutros Boutros-Ghali as secretary general of the United Nations ahead of the force in his talks with Mandela.
ECAT	A Federal Reserve monetary tightening in 1997 is less likely now, since inflation is stable, a prominent economist said. "Fed tightening anytime in 1997 is much less likely now, since inflation in the two-percent to three-percent range is essentially price level stability," said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics, Inc. in its 1997 outlook luncheon on Thursday. "The Federal Reserve's task will be to keep inflation there, suggesting no quick move to lower interest rate even if the economy should fade, he said. The slower-growth in U.S. economy and quiet inflation could lead to some increased growth and price inflationary pressures, which, however, will not be major ones, he noted. Sinai forecast a 5-1/4 percent federal funds rate until at least the February 4-5, 1997 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. With no change in Federal Reserve policy, a 2-1/2 to three percent running rate on inflation, and equal chances of higher as well as lower inflation going forward, the range for the 30-year treasrury bond yield is estimated at 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 percent, with 6-1/2 percent the mid-point value, he said. Sinai said the favorable outlook for the U.S. stock market is derived particularly "from a new, lower long-term interest rate profile going forward." "This is true whether the economy picks up or keeps languishing," he added. For the dollar, the picture is still bright, Sinai said. In the near- to intermediate-term, the dollar/yen remains 111 to 115, then 115 plus to 120 sometime in the first part of 1997, he projected. "The positive U.S. dollar fundamentals still seem cyclical in nature...,so that its upward pattern will be irregular, uneven, and interrupted by corrections." Sinai said. --North America Treasury Desk, 212-859-1660
GCAT	Scotland host Ireland at Murrayfield on Saturday in a Five Nations rugby union clash that has pride - and British Lions places - at stake. While England and France clash in a probable championship decider at Twickenham, the Edinburgh match is likely to decide only who finishes in last place. Both sides go into the game on the back of record thrashings by England. The Scots have also lost on home soil to Wales while Ireland were beaten by France but scraped past Wales in Cardiff. Both coaches will look back to the first hour of their respective games against England when their charges were still in contention - and both will hope to avoid the late collapses that saw the points against column click into the 40s. Scotland have switched Gregor Townsend back to centre and look to stiffen up the midfield with the introduction of former rugby leaguer Alan Tait. Tait won eight Scottish caps in the late 1980s before spending a decade in the 13-man code and the selectors are hoping his professionalism will ensure the Scots do not again wilt in the latter stages. Townsend, Scotland's most creative player, has been bouncing from fly-half to centre for some time and will hope his link with the strong-running Tait will punch through the Irish line. The move allows the return of Craig Chalmers to the number 10 jersey and sees Tony Stanger moving from centre to the right wing. Skipper Rob Wainwright switches to blindside flanker, with Peter Walton taking over the number eight duties. Ireland will look to start with their usual intensity, but must find a way of keeping some control in the second half. The victory over Wales came only after a desperate reargaurd action and the selectors have looked to New Zealand for discipline. Murray Kidd may have moved on but the Kiwi connection is still strong in the shape of hooker Ross Nesdale and centre Kurt McQuilken. Coach Brian Ashton, who on Thursday committed himself to Ireland until 2003, had gone for Brian O'Meara instead of Niall Hogan at scrum half but injuries have hit his plans hard. Missing are Eric Elwood, stalwart prop Nick Popplewell, winger James Topping and in-form number eight Eric Miller. Scotland's Peter Walton said his Newcastle clubmate Poppelwell has been playing well this season and will be "a big miss for Ireland". Ireland have not won in Edinburgh since 1983 and it is nine years since their last home success against the Scots. But Ashton insisted on Thursday: "We are confident and this is by no means a second division game." While both teams will be trying hard to avoid a potential last place in the championship, another motivating factor for several players on view is a possible place in the British Lions squad to tour to South Africa. All 30 are well versed in doughty defence in the face of sustained pressure - just the thing Fran Cotton's men may need in the summer.

MCAT	Thai stocks moved in the negative zone throughout the session on Wednesday and closed slightly lower as investors grew weary over a delay in the nomination of a new premier, brokers said. The SET index ended 7.27 points lower at 1,034.94 on 3.3 billion baht trade. Decliners led gainers 225 to 91 while 100 issues were unchanged. The SET-50 index was 0.69 point down to 78.97. "Investors sold stocks after they felt it was taking too long to nominate the new prime minister. They're getting a bit frustrated," said Sanpong Limthamrongkul of Jardine Fleming.   Brokers said investors felt uncertain as long as the nomination of the new prime minister was not settled. The nomination of a new premier would give a clearer picture to investors on who would be appointed to key economic ministerial portfolios, brokers said. The market initially rose after Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa announced on Saturday he was stepping down in seven days. Leaders of the six-party coalition are currently discussing who would succeed Banharn.   The finance sector fell most due to profit taking, slipping 2.24 percent. The banking sector was down 0.97 percent and the property sector declined 0.47 percent. Debuting stock GCN Finance topped the lists of most active stocks in terms of value and volume, ending down 3.25 baht from its initial public offering price of 28 baht. Finance One fell 2.50 to 99.50 while Bangkok Bank slipped two to 216 and Italian-Thai Development declined two to 173. Brokers said the index is expected to continue falling on Thursday as investors continue to wait for the nomination of the new prime minister. -- Suthep Chawla (662) 652-0642

GCAT	Tens of thousands of demonstrators thronged central Belgrade on Wednesday, keeping up pressure on Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to deliver on a promise to reinstate opposition election victories. Iron-grey ranks of paramilitary police were out in strength too. This time they did not leave their automatic rifles behind in their buses as usual but carried them slung over their shoulders, witnesses said. Teargas guns and CS gas cartridges were also within reach. The autocratic Milosevic suddenly announced on Tuesday, the 77th day of relentless protests, that he was asking parliament to reinstate disputed results of November's local elections. Two days earlier he had ordered his anti-riot police to forcibly break up the Belgrade demonstrations. Repeated baton charges left scores injured in the worst street violence seen in Belgrade for years and prompted an international outcry. Diplomats said Milosevic's decision was not unexpected, but they wondered why it took three months. Authoritative political sources in Serbia told Reuters it took time for moderates to overcome diehard opinion within Milosevic's socialist establishment. Leaders of Serbia's three-party opposition coalition, while giving a cautious welcome to the apparent climbdown, have nevertheless insisted on continuing the protests. There were many sceptics among Wednesday's 50,000-strong crowds packing the tree-lined avenues and cobbled pedestrian precincts of central Belgrade. "I do not trust them at all -- even when I buy (the pro-government newspaper) Politika, I check the date to see if it's correct," opposition politician Vuk Draskovic told the marchers, who whistled, stamped, cheered and blew horns. "We will sooner have babies before they recognise anything," said economist Zarko Sakic, 40. "I was beaten six times and if need be let them beat me 20 times more because this is my way to protest against this lying regime," said a shabbily dressed man in his 30s. An engineer in suit and tie shrugged. "All of what we do is completely ridiculous but I will miss the demonstrations when they end...people found a lot of wit in them, high spirits, new friends and new loves," he said. The scepticsm was shared by foreign governments. French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said he hoped Milosevic's decision was not simply a delaying tactic. Washington has said it welcomed the move "as a first step in the right direction in Serbia". Milosevic's move to have parliament, dominated by his Socialist Party, enact a special bill to uphold the November election outcome in keeping with recommendations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), seemed clear cut at first. But some experts questioned whether the solution was constitutional. Constitutional court judge Slobodan Vucetic said Milosevic was empowered only to urge courts to establish the truth about the election results, not have parliament decide the matter. Drago Hiber, legal committee chief of the Zajedno (Together opposition coalition), said he expected further wrangling over the findings of the OSCE mission and "what this special law should recognise". The 54-nation OSCE, from which Yugoslavia has been suspended, verified that Zajedno won the municipal vote in 14 towns and cities, including Belgrade, without "irregularities" cited by the ruling Socialists when they nullified the results. But the opposition also demands an independent judiciary and free media ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections due by the end of this year. Opposition leaders were quick to note that police deployed in Belgrade were more heavily armed that usual. As well as their pistols, shields, one-metre(yard)-long batons, they carried the M-72, the Yugoslav-made Kalashnikov rifle. "Emotions are often quicker than reason -- many people have been beaten -- but please, please, clench your teeth and understand every blow you get is also a medal," said Draskovic. "Do not give them any motive to beat us -- go home after the protest," he told the crowd.
GCAT	Experts at France's Pasteur Institute have failed to identify the specific virus which killed 38 people in Romania's worst viral meningitis epidemic in a decade, Romanian health authorities said on Wednesday. "So far the Pasteur Institute in Paris could not identify the pathogen agent behind the meningitis epidemic in Romania," the health ministry said in a statement. Romania sought help from Western medical experts after local institutes failed to identify the virus which triggered the epidemic which has spread to nearly half the Balkan country, with most cases registered in its capital Bucharest. Romania would also send test samples for identification to Britain's Collindale Institute, the statement said. As many as 444 patients, including some 50 children, were hospitalised across Romania after the epidemic began at the end of July. Of the 38 death toll, most were elderly people. The viral disease, which usually lasts a week, causes high fever, headaches and vomiting and affects the gastro-intestinal tract. Tourists returning from Cyprus apparently brought the disease to Romania, medical experts said. More than 100 people fell ill with mild meningitis in Limassol, the southern coastal hub of Cyprus's tourist industry, in July. In 1986 Romania suffered an epidemic of the more dangerous bacterial meningitis which killed some 15,000 people in central Africa this year.
CCAT	Two further large Italian banks cut their prime lending interest rates on Friday after pressure earlier this month for lower interests rates from Italian prime minister Romano Prodi. Banca Commerciale Italiana said it was cutting its prime rate by 0.5 of a percentage point to 9.5 percent and its top rate one percentage point to 16 percent, while Banco Ambrosiano Veneto cut its prime rate by the same amount to 9.5 percent and its top rate by 1.25 percentage point to 16.5 percent. Both said the new rates would take effect from December 23. This followed a move late on Thursday by Italy's biggest bank Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino which said it was cutting its prime rate 0.5 of a percentage point to 9.5 percent and its top rate 1.5 percentage point to 16 percent from Monday. The prime rate is the rate at which Italian banks lend to their best customers and the top rate is the ceiling rate at which they lend to clients. Prime minister Prodi on December 5 had urged Italian banks to cut lending rates saying lower inflation was not enough to guarantee economic recovery. He was speaking on the day November Italian consumer price index (CPI) inflation fell to 2.6 percent from October's 3.0 percent, the lowest level since June 1969. Prodi said there was a growing gulf between rates charged to banks' best clients and the top rates for similar operations. The Bank of Italy has cut its discount rate twice this year in July and October, both times by 75 basis points, and many economists expected a further cut after preliminary December inflation data to be published on December 19 and 20. Last week, Treasury minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi called for a cut in Italian interest rates saying he believed that conditions were right for a cut in interest rates and argued that the real rate of interest in Italy, or the interest rate related to inflation, was still too high.
ECAT	The flow of foreign currency deposits into cash-strapped Pakistan may slow unless the rate of return is increased, bankers said on Monday. The return on dollar deposits is currently 0.5 percent above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). "The return should be at least two percent above LIBOR if Pakistan wants to attract more foreign currency deposits at a faster pace," Maqsood Ahmad, vice-president of the private Muslim Commercial Bank, told Reuters. He said the number of institutional investors willing to lend foreign currency to Pakistan dropped sharply after Moody's Investors Service cut its credit ratings on November 6. "The few lenders left are seeking higher returns," Ahmad said. Banks were unable to borrow abroad at less than 1.5 percent above LIBOR because the downgrade by Moody's had increased Pakistan's country risk. Moody's lowered Pakistan's sovereign ceiling for foreign currency loans to B2 from B1. Its ceiling for foreign currency bank deposits was cut to B3 from B2 and Moody's said it was possible this rating would be further downgraded. A foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said bankers had suggested at a meeting on Saturday with Shahid Javed Burki, adviser on finance and economic affairs, that returns should be raised for banks bringing in deposits of at least $10 million. The State (central) Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Sunday extended to December 10 the deadline for a high-yield concessionary scheme to banks bringing in forex deposits. In October, SBP governor Muhammad Yaqub offered a 17 percent annual return on the rupee equivalent of foreign currency deposits brought by banks from abroad between October 22 and November 28 in a bid to replenish depleted reserves. Foreign reserves, excluding gold and special drawing rights, fell to $573 million on October 31 but rose to $670 million on November 7, according to SBP figures. The central bank also withdrew on Sunday an earlier restriction that the 17 percent return would only be applicable to any increase in banks' forex deposits as of October 22. Bankers said the cost of borrowing from international markets added to the cost of transactions, including a 10 percent withholding tax, and this had kept inflows slow. They said the SBP's restriction that the funds committed to the 17 percent scheme could not be swapped into rupees and invested in government paper had also dampened enthusiasm. Ahmad said the actual return after accounting for the cost of investment was no more than 14 percent, which he said was not fair given that the SBP was charging 20 percent on repurchase (repo) discounting and offering six-month bonds at 15 percent. The SBP auctioned six-month federal bonds worth a total of 2.88 billion rupees in a special open market operation on Sunday at a maximum cut-off of 15 percent a year. Bankers say Pakistan's liquid foreign reserves, now at $670 million, could reach $1 billion by December, but it was not clear if the rise could be sustained unless banks bringing in foreign currency are compensated for the higher country risk.

GCAT	After coming through a pressure-packed Olympic year with gold and glory, track superstar Michael Johnson is planning to have more fun in 1997. "I'm going to take it easy through the year and not be under any pressure, just go out and run and have fun this year," Johnson said Monday at a luncheon hosted by his management company. Johnson earned his place among the track immortals last summer when he became the first man ever to win gold at both 200 and 400 meters at the same Olympics, racing to an astonishing world record of 19.32 seconds in the 200 and an Olympic record of 43.49 in the 400 in Atlanta. But the enormous pressure of the U.S. Olympic trials and competing at the Games after his disappointment in Barcelona four years earlier put a damper on Johnson's enjoyment level. "Last year was fun, but I wasn't able to have fun while I was doing it. I was able to have fun after the races were over," said Johnson, who plans to sit out the indoor athletics season this year. Johnson said he expects to get back to competition in late April with a 400 meter race somewhere in the United States, followed by a couple of 200 meter races in May. The highlight of his season prior to the world championships in Athens, however, will likely be a made-for-television match race against Olympic 100 meters champion Donovan Bailey, set for June 1 in Toronto. While the mythical moniker of "world's fastest man" is traditionally bestowed upon the Olympic 100 meters gold medalist, Canadians were stung by Games commentators using that phrase to descrive Johnson after his Atlanta heroics. The two will race over the unconventional distance of 150 meters, with $1 million going to the winner and $500,000 to the loser. While he expects to win, Johnson doesn't believe the race will settle the dispute. "To be honest, I'll prove on that day, at that given time I could beat Donovan Bailey at 150 meters," Johnson said. "Everybody else will make up their mind as to whether that means I'm the fastest man in the world. But there is no way to prove that because it is not like going out to get a gold medal or a world record, which both of us holds," he said. "It is just entertainment to the people and it's a great opportunity for the sport." Attaining such lofty goals last year has done little to diminish Johnson's taste for winning. "In order to remain a great athlete you got to compete every year and compete well," he said. "You don't want to be second best in your event, that's a really big thing. You want to go out and win. "It's always go out and win."
ECAT	Pakistanis have responded warmly to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's appeal for funds to help shrink the $30 billion foreign debt, but bankers and economists said on Wednesday the scheme could backfire. The chief economist of a foreign bank, speaking anonymously, said the plan might ease Pakistan's immediate foreign exchange crunch but could store up trouble for the future. "It has been launched on the assumption that Pakistan will be able to correct the imbalances of its external sector and will have enough cash in reserves in the next two years. "But it is a dangerous gamble. If that does not happen, and Pakistan continues to have a large current account deficit and the situation deteriorates, people may react angrily," he said. "This may result in a political crisis and in turn exacerbate the economic crisis," he said. Sharif, convincing winner of the February 3 elections, has vowed to "break the begging-bowl" and reduce Pakistan's reliance on foreign borrowing to finance its current account deficit. In a televised speech last week, he appealed for help from Pakistanis both at home and abroad. Contributors can make donations, give an interest-free loan of at least US$1,000 repayable in two to five years, or place a minimum of $1,000 in an interest-bearing, fixed-term deposit maturing in two to five years with profits payable quarterly. "I would not be surprised if a total of $1 billion is deposited in the scheme in view of the attractive returns offered," the chief economist said. "But high returns do not necessarily result in huge deposits." The returns offered range from 7.5 percent a year on two-year dollar deposits to nine percent on five-year deposits. The economist said the State (central) Bank of Pakistan had lured only $450 million in institutional deposits when it offered a 17 percent return on the rupee equivalent of foreign exchange deposits under a special scheme launched in October. Bankers said that scheme had an estimated return in dollar terms of around 12 percent a year. The chief analyst at a foreign investment bank said Sharif's idea might stretch the maturity of foreign exchange deposits estimated at $9 billion if savers shift their funds from three- to six-month deposits into the two-year special account. "This can be a dangerous gamble as it actually does not mean fresh money is coming in. On the other hand, the government will have to be prepared for a massive withdrawal when the deposits start maturing two years down the line," he said. He said few people were likely to put money into deposits with longer maturities than the two-year minimum. "The danger is that the whole exercise may prove to be a breather only, and may only delay a forex crunch which may turn out to be a much larger crisis," the banker said. Sharif, during his first stint in power, allowed individuals to open foreign exchange deposits in 1991 to boost reserves then at around $400 million and to meet a payments crisis, he noted. "It paid off initially as the government used part of it for beefing up reserves and financing the current account deficit, but now the financial sector of Pakistan has a liability of $9 billion against these deposits," he said. An economic bulletin of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. said apart from short-term borrowing from the international market, Pakistan was increasingly using forex deposits to fund its external deficit. "Since the deficit has risen sharply from $2.16 billion in 1994/95 to $4.24 billion in 1995/96, while long-term capital inflows actually fell, Pakistan had to resort to short-term borrowing and its foreign currency accounts to finance the external deficit," it said.
CCAT	The Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul set a base price of 440 million reais for a 35 percent stake in Companhia Riograndense de Telecomunicacoes SA (CRT), which it plans to auction on December 17, officials said Thursday. Bid specifications were published in local newspapers on Thursday, outlining conditions set on the sale of 262,352,653 shares of telecommunications company, state officials said. Six foreign-led consortia have prequalified to bid on the shares, according to state officials.   The tender document also sets the guidelines for the disbursal of another 22,487,340 shares, or three percent of the total, which are being offered to workers. The CRT sale is being closely watched because it will kick off the privatization of Brazil's telecoms, including Telebras, the huge telecommunications concern owned by the federal government. Envelopes containing economic proposals will be presented at 1100 local/0800 EST/1300 GMT on December 17 at the Rio Grande do Sul industry federation convention center in Porto Alegre.   The six prequalfied groups -- consisting of 25 companies -- have a total net worth of $186 billion. They are: * France Telecom with Brazil's Banco Opportunity, Banco do Brasil and pension funds Previ, Sistel, CRT Employees Fund and Telos. The group's net worth: 46.5 billion reais. * Korea Telecom of South Korea, with Brazil's Odebrecht, Stelar Telecom, Unibanco and Folha de Sao Paulo. Net worth: 18.4 billion reais.
MCAT	French stocks steady at unchanged levels after slipping from earlier highs during Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's keynote policy speech. Thomson-CSF, a privatisation candidate, biggest loser in CAC-40 after Jospin said government does not favour privatisation of state electronic and aerospace firms. Thomson shares slumped 4.12 percent at 1355 GMT to 145.5 francs compared with 152.8 when the speech started. The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up 4.18 points or 0.15 percent at 2,755.92 at 1356 GMT while the CAC-40 futures contract was at 2,754 from 2,783 at the start of the speech.
GCAT	Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Madrid on Sunday to protest against European integration as dictated by the Maastricht Treaty. Organisers of the Spanish anti-Maastricht movement said 10,000 protestors were protesting against the capitalist interests represented by the Maastricht Treaty, the blueprint for Europe's economic and monetary union. "(Our objective) is to stimulate critical thought about the construction of Europe, whose burden has been placed on the shoulders of society and is causing serious economic, social and environmental inequalities," said one protester. Protesters, brandishing banners saying "Maastricht, no", complained that the drive for economic and monetary union  was polarising wealth, magnifying the North-South divide and worsening unemployment. The protest, called by Madrid's Movement against Maastricht's Europe and Economic Globalisation, assembled supporters from 35 action groups including trade unions and agricultural groups. EU leaders met in Dublin this weekend to discuss the details of how a single European currency will work and a new European treaty which will be approved in Amsterdam in June.  REUTER
CCAT	- How many of us in the business world have ever paused at work in mid-career to ask ourselves, "Whatever happened to my dream?" For those who have forgotten their dreams, management author Allan Cox, chairman of Berryman Communications Co. in Chicago, says we are not alone, that "everybody has the potential of getting lost, no matter who they are or where they are." "I think that virtually every executive as he or she moves through their career loses touch with what we care about, the things where our heart was when we were 14 or 15 years old," Cox asserted. "With the mortgage payments, the child-rearing, the career climb, by the time you get into your 30s or 40s, (our dreams) have gotten buried," he said. "At some point we need to reclaim them, to re-examine who we are." So when his publisher asked him to write another book about teamwork, Cox replied, "I'd rather do a book on human purpose, that you can't be good at what you do if you don't care and that you can't care if you're not authentic." In "Redefining Corporate Soul: Linking Purpose & People" (Irwin, $24.95), Cox says that everywhere he goes, he finds "people trying to reconnect with authenticity." "...There's a desire on their part to rediscover what they care about, so that caring can be turned toward doing a job that they'd love to do." Those who don't, Cox said, "don't serve their company and themselves well" and slip into boredom, depression, and alcoholism "because they don't have any joy in life." "Instead of saying, 'I don't like what I'm doing,' Cox writes, "employees need to ask themselves: 'What does my company want to have done? Am I the person to do it? Is this the time it should be done?' and 'With whom do I team up to get it done?'" Much of what constitutes authentic vision, Cox said, comes to us intuitively, in what longshoreman-philosopher Eric Hoffer called "flashes." "If we do not know how to capture the flashes, we are without growth and exhilaration," Hoffer said. Cox advises people to heed, and act upon, these insights. "Let's face it," he writes. "I'm more alive, spontaneous, and relaxed when I'm on the beam, when I'm locked into something bigger than I am. And it requires less effort to be yourself than to be something you're not." Just like people, Cox reflects, corporations, too, must wrestle with authenticity. "When a company gets caught up in what it thinks it ought to be, 'me-tooism,' or imitation or responding to what their competition is doing, it can lose contact with its purpose." "You might make gourmet bread, widgets, diesel engines or fax machines. You might offer phone service, hotel rooms or overnight package delivery," Cox writes. "The issues are the same." -- Do you and your employees have fun at work? -- Do you get a lift from doing a great job, from figuring out a client's problem? -- Do you remember what got you excited in the first place? -- Is yours a company that cares for its people and their futures? -- Are your people, and you, rededicated every day to a positive business purpose or are you all just picking up a paycheck? Businesses like Procter & Gamble, 3M, Motorola, and Wal-Mart -- whose stocks outperform their competitors -- have leaders with "here-and-now contact with their own authenticity, their corporate soul," Cox contended. The successful company, Cox concludes, must foster "resonance," by merging its mission "with the individual missions of its people." This is done by redefining corporate soul: "the contact that makes you come face to face with your real purpose."

MCAT	The Croatian average money market rate dropped to 9.2 percent from 10.3 percent on Monday amid shrinking demand for fresh kuna funds, dealers said. Total settlements reached a modest 20.8 million kuna, roughly half of which were old loans and the rest were call money borrowings, made at a rate of nine percent. No fresh longer-term loans were made and the end of trading left a surplus of 30 million kuna on the supply side. Overnight trade at the weekend reached 29.5 million kuna, which four banks with shortfalls used to square their position. The central bank calculated its kuna midrates for Tuesday slightly weaker at 5.4029 against the dollar and 3.5696 against the German mark. -- Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075
GCAT	Poland's ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski praised Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in a letter of condolence on Thursday as a statesman who had gazed boldly into the future. Kwasniewski, who led the transformation of Poland's old communist party into a social democratic formation supporting market reforms after it lost power in 1989, wrote to Deng's chosen heir Jiang Zemin expressing sadness over his death. "Deng Xiaoping was an innovative politician and a statesman who looked boldly into the future," said the letter, released by Kwasniewski's office to PAP news agency. "The changes which China accomplished under his leadership will be lastingly entered on the pages of history. I bow my head in sadness, sharing the pain of the Deceased's family and of the entire Chinese nation," Kwasniewski wrote.
GCAT	A northwestern Chinese town, struck by a powerful earthquake and a series of aftershocks on Friday, has been turned into a tent city as frightened residents fled homes and offices, officials said. The quake measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale killed nine people and injured 60 in Jiashi in northwest China's Xinjiang region, officials said on Saturday. Rescue efforts in the town of about 270,000 people were being directed from makeshift offices, they said. "We are working from a tent," said a local official, speaking from a hastily-installed telephone. "We have been working through the night to maintain security and ensure rescue operations," he said. Other residents said the numerous aftershocks had flattened most older dwellings and had damaged many newer, multi-storey buildings. Army and paramilitary units were helping with rescue efforts and President Jiang Zemin asked local government leaders for a report on the disaster. The quake was the latest in a series of tremors than have jolted the mainly Moslem region near China's borders with its Central Asian neighbours. At least 23 people were injured and thousands of buildings damaged in Jiashi by two large earthquakes last Sunday. No deaths were reported. Jiashi county lies at the meeting of the Pamir-Lake Baikal seismological belt and the seismological belt of the Himalayas, making it an area vulnerable to frequent tremors, seismological officials said. More than 4,000 tremors have jolted the northwestern region since January, and many of Jiashi's residents had been in tents for some time. "The ground just hasn't stopped shaking," said a resident. Further earthquakes with a magnitude of more than six on the Richter scale were forecast, the official Xinhua news agency quoted seismological officials as saying. In 1961, three earthquakes measuring more than six on the Richter scale jolted Jiashi, and aftershocks continued for 20 months, a seismological official said.
GCAT	Three Arab nationals and a retired Paraguayan military officer were arrested in connection with threats against the U.S. embassy in Asuncion, a Paraguayan police spokesman said on Thursday. "The arrests were made yesterday and today simultaneously in (the border town of) Ciudad del Este and in Asuncion," police spokesman Antonio Noguera told Reuters. "But for the moment they are just being held for questioning." U.S. diplomats said on Tuesday the American embassy was threatened by an international guerrilla group which officials in Washington hinted could be the Iranian-backed Hizbollah. The embassy suspended public celebrations of the U.S. presidential election after receiving what it termed a "terrorist threat." A statement on the threat was also issued by the State Department in Washington. Asked if Hizbollah, which is best known in Lebanon but also reportedly has affiliates in other countries, was behind the threat, a U.S. official said on Tuesday: "I wouldn't steer you away from that." Another official said: "I don't think we're talking about indigenous groups here. We're talking about groups that operate on a global basis." The Moslem fundamentalist Hizbollah has been blamed for past attacks in neighbouring Argentina that destroyed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992, killing 29 people, and a Jewish community centre there in 1994, killing 86. U.S. experts on Latin America have suggested guerrillas might choose Paraguay for an attack because of the relative ease of fleeing the country, particularly from Ciudad del Este, where the borders of Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil meet.
CCAT	Teck Corp said Tuesday it does not plan to make a bid for Bre-X Minerals Ltd. Teck chief executive Norman Keevil told a conference call that the company is in no rush to spend its strong cash position and that its emphasis would be on new mine development rather than acquisitions. "There won't be any Bre-X...buyout," Keevil said, adding that Teck had made offers to both Bre-X and Arequipa Resources Ltd in their early stages. Arequipa was recently acquired by Barrick Gold Corp.   Bre-X announced last month it was exploring all options to develop its Busang gold deposit in Indonesia including selling a majority stake. Since then, Bre-X stock has tumbled on investor worries about an ownership dispute over the property. Traders have speculated that Teck could be among the major mining companies vying for Bre-X. Keevil said Teck was in its strongest financial position ever thanks to Inco Ltd's takeover of Teck's stake in Diamond Fields Resources Inc, which resulted in a net gain for Teck of C$232 million in the third quarter. Teck had cash and short-term investments of C$457.8 million at September 30. -- Reuters Vancouver Bureau (604) 664-7314
CCAT	Wave Systems Corp said on Friday it had entered into a memorandum of understanding with Creative Technology Ltd to incorporate Wave's electronic commerce system in Creative's multimedia products. Wave is the developer of a digital content metering system that ensures payment when information publishers transmit information to customers over computer networks. Creative is a leading supplier of multimedia enabling technology that allows personal computers to handle voice and video applications.   Wave said that with its technology, content providers will be able to securely offer -- and consumers will be able to purchase -- entertainment and educational multimedia software and other digital content on a pay-per-use basis via a PC. The Wave metering system, under development since the late 1980s, has failed to gain acceptance, in part due to Wave's failure to seed the technology among computer hardware makers so that it is widely available to consumers. The deal with Creative, if finalized, could help eventually thrust Wave technology into the consumer mainstream.   "The adoption of Wave's metering technology establishes a unique, powerful and secure electronic commerce solution for our customers," said Lung Yeh, vice president of the communication and Internet division of Creative. "Our planned partnership creates a completely new and efficient distribution model capable of securely delivering thousands of pay-per-use or rent-to-own titles," he said. Subject to final negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, the relationship will establish Creative as a supporter of Wave Interactive Network's Internet pay-per-use content service, knownn as WINPurchase, the company said.   The WINPurchase system allows for secure transactions to be made either directly online over the Internet, "off-line" by copying information from compact disc, or through other electronic software distribution methods. The relationship with hardware component supplier Creative follows deals Wave has signed with various "edutainment" software suppliers to use its system to distribute their software titles. These partners include Viacom Inc's Simon & Schuster Interactive unit, Strategic Simulations, and Star Press, a unit of Graphix Zone Inc, a spokesman said. -- Eric Auchard, New York Newsdesk 212-859-1736

GCAT	An Israeli shot and wounded one Palestinian on Monday in West Bank violence coinciding with a crisis visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, police said. A police spokeswoman said a second Palestinian who was initially believed to have been shot had lightly hurt himself when rushing to help the man who was shot. "There is a positive development in the investigation that will help catch the suspect that shot and seriously wounded one Palestinian," the spokeswoman said without elaborating. Palestinian witnesses said a Jewish settler fired on students and others in Kharbatha village, 17 kms (11 miles) west of Ramallah. A Palestinian hospital treated two Arabs. One was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the chest. Israeli police were looking for the gunman. They said he opened fire after Palestinians pelted his car with stones and then fled in the car. But villagers said the settler appeared to be looking for a confrontation. They said he had been deliberately driving near the school for some time even though the Israeli government had built a bypass road for Jews in the area. The Palestinian Authority, which controls eight West Bank towns including Ramallah, administers Kharbatha. But the village is under full Israeli security jurisdiction. Netanyahu was due to meet President Bill Clinton later in the day as part of a U.S. effort to rescue peacemaking. The West Bank and Gaza have been rocked by unrest since Israel broke ground on March 18 for a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. Three Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire and scores of people wounded. "A settler got out of his car and began to shoot...The students ran away and after that the settler himself...began to fire in the air and randomly," a Palestinian witness said. "After that he shot two people from our village, one to his chest, and his case is not very good," he said. A Jewish settler spokesman said the man opened fire in response to "massive stone-throwing". But Khaled Injas, of Kharbatha, said: "I don't know why he comes to this village every day. They have their own road." Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's aide Tayeb Abdel-Rahim told Israel's Arabic-language radio on Monday the Palestinian Authority was considering sending two senior negotiators to Washington in answer to a U.S. invitation. Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who returned on Sunday from talks in Washington, said a closure which Israel tightened in the West Bank and Gaza after a March 21 suicide bombing in Tel Aviv would remain in effect. Some 130,000 Jews live in settlements scattered among more than two million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

MCAT	Delhi shares climbed higher in early trade on Monday as traders ignored turbulent political developments in India's ruling United Front to make fresh purchases at the start of a new settlement period, brokers said. The bourse's benchmark index was 10.07 points higher at 920.53 points after 30 minutes of trade.   Brokers said strong buying by foreign and domestic financial institutions helped lift prices. "Massive purchases by foreign institutional investors show the market has ignored an adverse political situation following a split in the Janata Dal, a constituent of the ruling United Front government," said Harish Malhotra of brokers Malhotra Financial Consultants. Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's Janata Dal party split on Saturday, but breakaway leader Laloo Prasad Yadav assured continued support to the ruling 15-party United Front alliance, which runs a minority government. Reliance Industries gained 10.70 rupees to 365.25 on strong buying by foreign investors, brokers said. ITC surged 34.50 rupees to 561.50 on speculative buying as the share will be in a no-delivery period for the next two settlements, they said. ACC shot up 118.00 rupees to 1,602.00.

GCAT	Canadians are experiencing a winter of dismay as their national religion -- ice hockey -- is shaken by sex scandals, fraud trials and the decline of their once dominant teams. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Canada's greatest triumph on ice -- a last-minute victory in a series against the Soviet Union that whipped this placid country into a patriotic frenzy. "It was the one time that we were distinctly Canadian," Paul Henderson, a journeyman player who achieved hockey sainthood for scoring the winning goal in the final game of the 1972 Summit Series, said in a recent interview. But memories of past glory are tempered by fears that Canada is losing its grip on the game. The current season began with the faith-shattering defeat of Canada by the United States in the final of the inaugural World Cup of Hockey. And computer-enhanced pucks that leave bizarre colour trails on television screens, and the NHL's expansion into U.S. markets with little hockey tradition have left purists cringing at the Americanisation of their game. The most disturbing recent blow has been a sex scandal involving young boys and Canada's oldest hockey shrine -- Maple Leaf Gardens, home of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Canadian police have charged two Gardens' employees after uncovering a pedophile ring that allegedly lured teenaged boys to the arena with free tickets and autographs of their hockey heroes. The sordid tale, which may involve up to 60 victims between the late 1960s and early 1990s, has grabbed newspaper headlines across the country. "Maple Leaf Gardens was a sex haven of abused boys, tons of them. They would lay down blankets and they would get us naked and have group sex," one victim, 34-year-old Martin Kruze, has said of the abuse he says started when he was 13. It's not the only sex abuse case to rock hockey this year. Graham James, one of Canada's top junior coaches, pleaded guilty in January to sexually assaulting two players in the 1980s and was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison. James admitted to more than 300 instances of sexual assault over six years against Boston Bruins player Sheldon Kennedy, who was 14 when the assaults began in 1984. Since the James case broke, a minor league hockey coach in Calgary was charged with sexually assaulting a player at a summer camp, and a community club hockey coach in Winnipeg, was suspended after a former player alleged sexual abuse. The revelations hit hard in a nation where it is traditional for parents of boys with pro hockey aspirations to turn their chidren over to the care of junior coaches, often far from home. "The sex cases have made Canadians very uneasy. It speaks directly to this power relationship between adult coaches and the children in hockey," University of Toronto psychologist John Ferudy said. Other criminal cases have also vied for space in the country's sports pages this winter. Former hockey czar and player agent Alan Eagleson, architect of the 1972 matchup between Canada and the Soviet Union, faces fraud and theft charges related to the billing of clients and handling of funds from international tournaments. The game's reputation for thuggery reared its ugly head again with a junior league brawl last month. Police in Halifax, Nova Scotia said criminal charges could soon come against a player who repeatedly punched an unconscious opponent who lay convulsing on the ice. Canada's junior teams still dominate international tournaments, but critics argue their success is due more to a grinding physical style of play than to superior skills. The influx of flashy Europeans into the NHL has also caused some concern in the game's homeland. Canadians now account for just 60 percent of NHL players, down from 76 percent a decade ago and 98 percent in 1968, and a Canadian has not led NHL rookies in scoring since 1988. Meanwhile, the future of Canada's small-market clubs looks grim. With the departure of the Winnipeg and Quebec teams to Phoenix and Denver, only six of the NHL's 26 clubs remain in Canada -- and all but one has a losing record this season. To add further insult, the league's current expansion plans are focused far from hockey's roots in small frozen towns across Canada. Last week, Hamilton, Ontario's bid for an NHL franchise was rejected, while steamy Atlanta appears hot favourite to get the next NHL team. "It's a slap not just in Hamilton's face, but in the face of all Canadians," said Hamilton bid organiser Gabe Macaluso. Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa are struggling to stay alive amid soaring costs. The Ottawa Senators have warned fans to buy more tickets or face losing the team. The Edmonton Oilers, who won five Stanley Cups in the 1980s before selling off their best players, plan to offer shares to the public this spring. "I'm doing this to keep the team here," Oilers' owner Peter Pocklington said. But this supposed effort on behalf of Edmonton will never buy Pocklington's way into hockey heaven. He will forever be loathed for shipping Canadian national treasure Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles.

ECAT	Turkey's recent move to support small and medium factories (KOBI) by introducing new incentives would boost the Turkish economy in coming years, a state bank general manager said. Yenal Ansen, general manager of Halkbank which specialises in low-interest loans to artisans and KOBIs, said the decree defining loan limits to KOBIs and interest rates on them showed the government was intent on supporting KOBIs' activities. "The decree which took effect on October 16, shows KOBIs are fundamentals of the Turkish economy as they play an important role in raising exports, increasing employment and quality in production," Ansen told Reuters in an interview. There are more than 200,000 KOBIs in Turkey, half of which receive finances from Halkbank in their investments. Ansen said Halkbank which supplied 124 trillion lira of loans to artisans and KOBIs in January-October 1996, targeted 140 trillion lira for this year and double this figure for 1997. Loans to KOBIs stood at around 50 trillion lira in 1995. The bank, with 78 percent of its total loans channelled to artisans and KOBIs, named 1996 "the year of KOBIs" and speeded up fund allocation for them and introduced an information service to help increase efficiency in this sector. "We see the return of low-interest credits we provide to KOBIs in the form of a production increase in this sector and new value added to the overall economy," Ansen said. "If we think about making profit, then we cannot provide these low-interest loans. But without making loss, we will continue to support them as our loans return to the system through new machinery or a newly employed person," he added. Ansen said they gave priority to the manufacturing industry which contributes directly to economic improvement. The new government decree introduced upper loan limits for different provinces -- 25 billion lira at 20 percent annual interest rate per KOBI in underdeveloped provinces and 20 billion lira at 30 percent in developed regions. The loan maturity will be three years for both regions. Turkey's year-on year wholesale inflation stood at 82.8 percent in October. According to the decree, the Treasury will separately channel five trillion lira to KOBIs as a first tranche, with the amount to be raised in line with future demand. Ansen said he expected the Treasury's part to go much higher in the 1997 budget, currently being discussed in parliament. -- Istanbul newsroom +90-212-275 08 75
GCAT	A Greek appeals court has approved the extradition of a woman wanted in Germany in connection with a 1986 West Berlin disco bombing that killed three people and wounded 200, court officials said on Wednesday. The woman, identified as Andrea Hausler, was arrested while vacationing in northern Greece in October with her two-year-old son and a male friend. Greek police have said that Hausler is the sister of a key suspect in the disco bombing, in which scores of off-duty U.S. military personnel were hurt. Two U.S. soldiers and a Turkish woman were killed in the attack, which prompted a U.S. air strike against Libya. Court officials said there were no charges against Hausler in Greece and she would probably leave soon for Germany. Socialist Justice Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos will have the final say and must sign her extradition order. Officials said Tuesday's court recommendation had not reached Athens. On a number of past occasions In the past, Greece's socialist governments have refused to extradite guerrilla suspects for what were deemed politically motivated crimes and this was seen as a test case for new Prime Minister Costas Simitis. Hausler is the sister of a woman identified as Verena C., 37, who was detained in Berlin in early October and accused of planting the bomb in the disco. German prosecutors have given no details on what role they believe Hausler might have played in the bombing. Berlin prosecutors arrested Verena C. and her Palestinian ex-husband, Ali C., saying she was suspected of planting the deadly bomb at his request. The United States blamed Libya for the attack on the "La Belle" disco and responded by bombing the Arab state, killing at least 15 people, including an adopted 15-month-old daughter of leader Muammar Gaddafi and wounding more than 100. German prosecutors said they believed Verena C. had planted the bomb at the request of Ali C. and another suspect, Yasser Shraydi, who was extradited to Germany from Lebanon in May this year. They believe the attack was orchestrated from the Libyan embassy in East Berlin. They have also issued arrest warrants for three former members of the Libyan embassy in East Berlin -- identified only by the surnames Elamin, Keshlaf and Al Abani -- and a Libyan secret service member named Rashed. The prosecutors believe those suspects provided the explosives and helped organise the bombing but that they are now back in their homeland.
GCAT	A Sicilian  politician and former president of the Palermo soccer club was arrested on suspicion of collusion with the Mafia on Friday, police said. They said Liborio Polizzi, 48, a centre-left councillor for sport and tourism in the Palermo provincial government, was suspected of providing safe housing for self-confessed Mafia killer Salvatore Cucuzza. Cucuzza, who was arrested last year, has admitted he took part in several murders, including that in 1982 of Pio La Torre, leader in Sicily of the now-defunct Italian Communist Party and a former president of the island's regional government. Polizzi entered politics in 1996, a year after he was sacked as president of Palermo soccer club.

ECAT	The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that Hungary's low economic growth rate may pick up over the next few years and catch up with the growth rates in Poland or the Czech Republic. "I expect gradually increasing growth rate," said Willy Kiekens, a member of the IMF's board of directors, told a news conference. "I think it could catch up with the Polish or the Czech level in the next few years.   The rate of GDP growth dropped to 1.5 percent last year, according to preliminary figures, from 2.9 percent in 1994 after Hungary introduced an economic austerity programme last March to rein in its soaring budget and current account deficits. Economic growth was quicker in both the Czech Republic and Poland, countries which, similarly to Hungary, are in transition to a market economy and hope to join the European Union. The Czech GDP increased by some five percent last year, and almost seven percent in Poland.   Hungary expects a growth rate below one percent for this year and some two to three percent in 1997. Members of the IMF's board of directors visiting Hungary told reporters the austerity programme may have slowed GDP growth, but the measures were necessary to stabilise the economy and create the conditions of sustainable growth. "In the second half of 1994 and in the first half of 1995, the economy was in a very fragile situation," Kiekens said. "In mid-term, there is a positive correlation between economic adjustment and growth," said Bernd Esdar, member the IMF's board of directors.   Esdar added that "Hungary achieved tremendous progress" and as a result of the economic programme the country has been able to significantly reduce its budget and current account deficits and inflation, while real wages have slumped, however. Kiekens told Reuters that Hungary's economic growth is likely to pick up if the country continues to reduce inflation and provided its fiscal deficit, not including debt service on loans to be taken over from the central bank, drops in 1997 to three percent of GDP from this year's four percent target.

MCAT	Israeli shares closed sharply higher in active trading on Sunday amid high activity by institutional and foreign investors, traders said. The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 2.72 percent, or 6.60 points, to 248.94 on high all-share turnover of 175 million shekels against 165 million shekels on Thursday, the last day of trading before the Israeli weekend. The Maof 25 blue chip index closed 2.86 percent higher at 257.37. "This is unbelievable. The market looks very good and activity is high. There is no logical explanation for the rise beside the fact that the positive momentum continues," said Shahar Gazit at Batucha Securities and Investments. "We were surprised today by the market's strength. Last week the market has stabilized and now its ready for another rise. All the technical indicators are showing that this is a real bull market," said Eli Nahum, head of trading at Zannex Securities. Traders said that the main buyers were institutional and foreign investors. "The positive momentum continues but nobody knows if the market can continue rising. It's difficult to say where the market is going," Gazit said. "Now we have to see if the market is strong enough to break into new high ground above the Maof's all time high at 258.91," Nahum added. The most active shares were Koor Industries, which rose 3.0 percent to 32,980 agorot on volume of 12.7 million shekels; Israel Chemicals, which gained 3.5 percent to 355 agorot on turnover of nine million shekels; and Poalim Capital Markets and Investments, which surged 4.5 percent to 13,354 agorot on volume of 6.6 million shekels. - Dan Gerstenfeld, Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
CCAT	Nahariya Dairy Strauss Ltd said on Thursday it hoped to conclude a final agreement with French food group Danone for it to take a minority stake in the Israeli food company by the end of the year. Under the terms of the agreement, Danone will purchase 20 percent of the privately-owned Strauss, one of Israel's largest food manufacturers and the leading supplier of ice cream. Strauss chairman and chief executive Michael Strauss told Reuters that press reports that the 20 percent stake would be sold for $40 million to $60 million were incorrect and that the deal had yet to be completed. "The lawyers of both sides are involved in finalising the agreement," he said. Strauss currently produces a number of Danone products under licence. Strauss said he expected cooperation between the two companies to increase further into new product fields. He also said he hoped Strauss would be able to export Danone products from Israel to nearby countries. Unilever has a 50 percent stake in Strauss's ice cream operations. - Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
CCAT	Shares in French foods group Danone fell on Friday as analysts drew adverse comparisons with Swiss giant Nestle, which reported strong first-half profits, and Dutch brewer Heineken, which warned of flat beer sales in Europe. One analyst said: "Some say Danone is undervalued. When you look at the Nestle figures, you can understand why." The Swiss company posted first half profit of 1.35 billion Swiss francs. Danone shares traded down 12 francs at 726, or 1.63 percent, at 1115 GMT, while the market was down 0.13 percent. Heineken's beer sales forecast also undermined the stock.   The Dutch brewer posted first-half profit up six percent to 297 million guilders and warned of a slightly lower profit for the 1996 full year compared to 1995's 664 million. Heineken's chairman said the company could not guarantee double-digit profit growth in the next three years. French analysts said Danone makes 10 percent of turnover from beer sales and the results would reflect any weakness in the market. -- Paris newsroom +33 1 4221 5452 wem/pnt
ECAT	The economy grew moderately in mid-summer with several regions reporting more robust activity, but there were few signs of rising prices or wage pressures, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. "Economic activity generally expanded at a moderate rate in many districts in June and July, although several reported that growth was more brisk," the central bank said in its periodic summary of economic activity. "Prices for most goods were stable, although reports indicated that lumber and some agricultural prices rose," the report, known as the Beige Book, said. The report, compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, was likely to bolster the widespread belief among investors that Fed policy-makers will hold interest rates steady when they meet on Aug. 19. The Fed raised short-term rates in March in a bid to ward off inflation, the first increase in more than two years, but has held them steady since. A survey of 33 economists by Reuters this week found that none expect the Fed to raise rates at the next meeting. The Fed said prices were stable overall and were being held in check by "competitive pressures" in much of the country, though several regions said prices were rising for agricultural and energy products. The central bank said labor markets had tightened further, with reported shortages of skilled workers, but "subdued" wage pressures. "Despite the persistent labor market tightness, wage pressures remained generally subdued," it said. Investors were rattled by a government report last Friday that unemployment fell to 4.8 percent in July, its lowest level in nearly 25 years, raising concerns about inflation. But separate government reports show wholesale prices have fallen for a record six months, while consumer prices so far this year have risen at the slowest pace since 1986. While consumer spending picked up in the June-July period, helped by summer weather, automobile sales were "slightly softer", the Fed said. "Manufacturing remained at a high level or expanded further across most industries, particularly for nonautomotive durables," it said. But most manufacturers said their inventories were at "generally desirable levels."
GCAT	The Edinburgh Festival, billed as the world's largest arts extravaganza, turns 50 this year with past and present triumphs on offer at rock bottom prices. From the San Francisco ballet to Australian aborigine dances, from the film of a Chinese homosexual's ordeal to Verdi's opera "Macbeth", the organisers plan a memorable party. "First and foremost I have tried to put on a humdinger of a festival but also to look back over 50 years and recreate some of the seminal moments," said festival director Brian McMaster. "The 50th birthday is cause for celebration," he said of the festival that managed to survive its shaky start when the Earl of Rosebery donated his winnings after a good day at the races. Seat prices have risen dramatically since the first festival in 1947 but Edinburgh is still one of the cheapest places to see and hear world-class performers. Five pound ($8) tickets are available for all shows. "Low prices are absolutely essential," McMaster said of the three-week festival in August. "Prices here are infinitely lower than any other major festival." Festival-goers will pay up to 50 pounds for the Royal Opera as opposed to 200 pounds at its Covent Garden home in London. The same difference applies to Peter Stein's Salzburg Festival production of Chekhov's "Cherry Orchard." EDINBURGH RESTAGING EARLY SUCCESSES THIS YEAR Blasts from the past abound. The Royal Opera returns after a 35-year absence with Verdi's "Macbeth" -- an outstanding success in 1947 -- and the first complete staging in living memory of Rameau's "Platee." Scottish Opera stage the original 1912 version of Richard Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos", not performed in Britain since Sir Thomas Beecham conducted it at the 1950 festival. The aboriginal Bangarra Dance Theatre offers the world premiere of "Fish", stories about Australia's indigenous people. San Francisco Ballet, one of America's finest classical companies, makes its first visit to Edinburgh for 17 years with two programmes. "Drink to me only with thine eyes", with music by Virgil Thomson, gives festival favourite Mark Morris -- who once said he would dance in a swamp to appear in Edinburgh -- an unaccustomed role as a classical choreographer. FESTIVAL GIVEN LITTLE CHANCE OF SUCCESS IN EARLY YEARS Drama includes a new production of T.S.Eliot's "Cocktail Party" which had its world premiere at the 1949 festival and Shakespeare's "Measure for Measure" -- Stephane Braunschweig's first English language production. "East Palace, West Palace" is film maker Zang Yuan's story of a homosexual writer picked up by police in the toilets of Beijing's Tienanmen square. In "Partition," Tamasha Theatre Company looks at the legacy of the 1947 partition of India in Britain's Hindu and Moslem communities. The festival, which has grown into the world's largest arts event, was given little chance of success when the city council started it to lighten some of the gloom after World War Two. Rudolph Bing, the first director, thought the rather austere Scottish capital unsuitable and wanted a move to Oxford. Last year, box office sales topped two million pounds for the first time. The International Festival along with the Fringe and Film Festivals and the Military Tattoo add about 1,000 jobs and 44 million pounds to Edinburgh's income. The 1997 budget is 5.8 million pounds with 65 percent raised by ticket sales, sponsorships and donations. The balance comes from official grants.

GCAT	Janez Drnovsek, who won a new term in office on Thursday, is credited with anchoring democracy and a thriving economy as prime minister in four of the five years since Slovenia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991. Drnovsek, 46, an economist and divorced father of one son, honed his political skills as the penultimate president of communist former Yugoslavia from 1989 to 1990. The experience served him well as he needed to perform a delicate balancing act during his first term of office in Slovenia to keep a fragile left-right coalition from splitting apart. He spurned pressure from his own centre-left Liberal Democrat Party last May to jettison the increasingly fractious Christian Democrats from the coalition. Drnovsek said he intended to keep the government together in the national interest rather than pander to party politics. His style drew praise from abroad and was a factor in consolidating a smooth transition from communist rule and a command economy, while other ex-Yugoslav republics turned to the gun. Drnovsek's Liberal Democrats increased their share of the vote in a November 10 general election and remained the biggest party, winning 25 out of 90 parliamentary seats. But an alliance of three right-wing parties just missed clinching an absolute parliamentary majority by just one seat, boosting their bid to form the new government. Drnovsek won over smaller parties, including former communists, and the support of one Christian Democrat to clinch Thursday's parliamentary vote by a wafer-thin margin of 46 to 44. Drnovsek has pledged to speed up privatisation, streamline the economy by cutting welfare payments and control inflation, which rose to 8.8 percent in 1996 from 8.6 percent a year ago. But he may now depend on support from former communists and a leftist pensioners' party, which are sure to demand less stringent welfare cuts and try to give the transition a kinder social face. Drnovsek crowned his first four years as leader by securing an association agreement with the European Union after patching up a row with Italy over the right of ethnic Italians to reclaim property they fled from at the end of World War Two. The EU deal hinges on Slovenia bringing in laws to change the constitution to allow foreign nationals to buy real estate. That legislation would need a two-thirds majority in parliament and rightwing parties have vowed they will block the process. Despite the difficulties ahead, Drnovsek predicts that Slovenia should become the first ex-Yugoslav republic to join the EU, possibly by the year 2001. Slovenia's stability so near to the unpredictable Balkan region has made it a serious contender for NATO membership. Drnovsek has said entry into the EU and NATO would remain a priority in his next government.
MCAT	Canadian T-bills opened firmer on Wednesday amid strong demand for a dwindling supply of T-bills, with dealers playing down the possibility of a near- term Bank of Canada rate cut. "There's basically a lot of cash with no real place to put it. That's the only thing driving things here. There is a camp out there thinking the Bank of Canada is going to move, but I can't see that happening with the dollar weakening off the way it is," said one T-bill trader. Canada's three-month when-issued T-bill firmed to yield 2.72 percent from 2.75 percent at Tuesday's close.   "In this case it's really a lack of supply and it's not like the Bank automatically follows the rally in bills every time," said a second trader. Canadian T-bills rallied sharply Tuesday amid strong foreign buying, leading some analysts to comment that the market was pricing in another Bank of Canada rate cut. But T-bill traders said another move by the bank in the near term was unlikely unless the Canadian dollar strengthened. The currency has weakened since the last cut, bringing the Bank of Canada's monetary conditions index to some of its lowest levels ever.   Supply in the Canadian market remained tight with the Bank of Canada Tuesday auctioning a lower than average C$4.8 billion of bills, even as C$7.8 billion of T-bills came due. The Bank of Canada this morning will auction C$1.5 billion seven-day T-bills. In other prices, the six-month when-issued bill firmed to yield 2.86 percent from 2.90 percent. The one-year when-issued bill firmed to yield 3.18 percent from 3.22 percent. The call loan or overnight lending rate traded at 3.0 percent, the center of the Bank of Canada's 2.75-3.25 percent target range, dealers said. -- Jeffrey Hodgson (416) 941-8105, e-mail: jeffrey.hodgson@reuters.com
ECAT	Pipeline British inflation set fresh record lows in January but the key question remains whether this will drag high street prices lower. On balance, economists say retail prices will subside but that may be more to do with signs of slowing consumer spending rather than the continued demise of producer price inflation pressures. "These figures are uniformly weak," said Philip Uglow, economist at Union Plc. "But the key is whether declines in PPI will have a knock-on effect at the retail level."   Uglow said retail prices would in the end by dragged lower but he noted that producer prices have been subdued or falling for more than a year but for many months retail price inflation stuck above three percent year-on-year. Monday's data showed output prices, those leaving the factory gate, rose at just 1.5 percent year-on-year in January, the lowest rate of increase since October 1986. Core output prices, excluding food, drink, tobacco and petroleum, rose 0.6 percent on a year earlier -- the lowest inflation rate in 30 years.   Whether retail price inflation slows in tandem or not, Monday's figures will certainly help Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke ward off pressure to increase interest rates anytime soon. He has insisted on leaving 6.0 percent base rates on hold since last October despite increasing pressure from Bank of England governor Eddie George. "Mr Clarke may be forgiven a wry smile," said David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy. "His judgement, after all, appears more in tune with recent economic data."   Retail price figures for January are due on Thursday. Underlying inflation is forecast to edge down to an annual 3.0 percent, from 3.1 in December. But more important for the interest rate argument will be the following week's retail sales data. High street sales actually fell 0.8 percent in December, calling into question ideas of a consumer boom. Analysts said December's sales should always be viewed in conjunction with January's. But evidence from the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey suggests there was no surge in spending last month either.   "The CBI evidence was relatively weak," Uglow said. "We expected a reported balance of 50 or more." Some 53 percent of UK retailers surveyed said sales rose in January while 17 percent said sales dropped -- a positive balance of 36 percent. But given that balance fell from 48 percent in November, to 33 in December, that hardly represented a dramatic turnaround. One thing is certain though. However the conflicting pressures on high street prices are resolved, there is no upward pressure from the producer level. That, in part, is due to the pound's meteoric rise over the past seven months.   Seasonally adjusted input prices fell a staggering 6.2 percent year-on-year in January. "That confirms the strength of the pound continues to place heavy downward pressure on industry costs," said Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets. But do not expect that to deflect the Bank of England in its crusade for higher interest rates. The Bank releases its quarterly inflation report on Wednesday and is expected to reassert its view that a strong currency is no substitute for tighter monetary policy. Unemployment figures, due on Wednesday, will also stir the inflation pot this week. "The big risk to UK inflation is the labour market and wages," said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economist at BankAmerica. He said there was a significant risk that rapidly falling unemployment will force up wages. "If that happens, it will be virtually impossible to keep inflation in check without a rate hike. This makes Wednesday's labour market report almost more important than the RPIs themselves." -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109
CCAT	Indian pharmaceutical company, Wockhardt said on Thursday its net profit for 1995/96 (July-June) rose 15.5 percent to 600 million rupees against the previous year. The company's net sales rose 32 percent to 2.35 billion rupees over the earlier accounting period. It also announced a 25 percent dividend after a meeting of its board of directors this week. Wockhard said it planned to invest over one billion rupees betweem 1997-2000 in research and development activity. The firm said it invested 700 million rupees in "new manufacturing facilities as well as expanding existing set-ups" in 1995/96. Its earning per share (EPS) stood at 17.05 rupees. -- Bombay newsroom +91-22-265 9000
CCAT	Nordstrom Inc said weak holiday sales, higher inventories than planned, higher markdowns and an increase in inventory "shrinkage" contributed to a decline in fourth quarter net income. Dan Nordstrom, a co-president of the upscale department store chain, said the impact of a merchandise reorganization in women's apparel was mostly behind the company but probably would have "some lingering effects." "We are pleased with customer response to our stores in promising new markets but disappointed with lower net income," he said in the company's earnings statement.   Nordstrom reported fourth-quarter net income of $0.53 per share -- far below the Wall Street consensus figure of $0.64 and last year's $0.67. While comparable-store sales rose 5.4 percent in January, they fell 3.8 percent in the crucial month of December and fell 1.3 percent for the quarter. For the year comparable-store sales rose 0.6 percent. Nordstrom said parts of its holiday merchandising strategy were not executed as well as planned, such as the assortment of gift items.   Nordstrom also cited an increase in inventory "shrinkage", which refers to inventory that is missing, generally due to theft or poor recordkeeping. The company said results were also hurt by five fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and by severe weather in the weeks after Christmas. Nordstrom also said higher write-offs on the company's credit card balances contributed to lower net income.   "The credit card write-offs have stabilized in the last three months, although for the past year they were higher than average," Dan Nordstrom said. He added that the merchandise reorganization "was a necessary move to meet our customers' changing needs and to position ourselves for the long term despite its downward impact on financial results in the short term." Nordstrom plans to open three new full-line stores opening in the second half of 1997 in Garden City, N.Y., Hartford, Conn., and Cleveland. The company also plans four new Rack discount stores this year. Nordstrom has a total 83 stores in 17 states. Nordstrom also said its board of directors had approved a third $100 million common stock repurchase program.  In October, the company completed a $100 million stock repurchase approved in May 1995. Nordstrom has bought $33 million of a second $100 million stock repurchase authorized in November. ((-- Reuters Seattle bureau 206-386-4848))

ECAT	The Slovak Statistical Bureau (SUSR) on Tuesday said consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in August to put prices 5.6 percent higher year-on-year, versus 5.5 percent in July. Analysts welcomed the result, slightly higher than July's monthly rise of 0.3 percent and easily the lowest in eastern Europe, put there was some scepticism. "The figure is perfect and realistic, but the question is how realistic is the base from which it is calculated," said Vladimir Kuklis, an analyst with CSOB Bank. Some analysts had predicted a sharper increase in inflation due to growing pressures from an expanding money supply and partial liberalisation of government price controls. Others said they distrusted the official figures and called for a revision of the basket on which the consumer price index is calculated. They pointed to such price-controlled items in the basket as public housing rents, fuels or transportation, which, they said, were too heavily weighted in the index. "Inflation seems to have reached it's floor at 5.5 percent taking into account recent energy price hikes, but we should witness the effect on inflation of money supply growth by the middle of next year at the latest," said Martin Barto, an analyst with ING Barings. The government raised retail and wholesale energy prices by 10 and five percent respectively from July, and set the maximum price of motor fuels up by about five percent. SUSR officials declined to comment on the issue of revising the CPI basket, but had said earlier a complex index revision was "being considered" some time next year. Neither the controlled price hikes nor the growing money supply have prompted the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) to revise its target for 1996 inflation within the range of 6.0-7.2 percent, which it has said was still realistic. Slovakia's key money supply measure, M2, rose 21.0 percent year-on-year in July, compared to a full 1996 target of an expansion of 11.6 percent. Analysts estimate the impact of M2 could show delays in Slovakia of between nine months to one year. -- Bratislava Newsroom, 42-7-210-3687
GCAT	Salim Ahmed Salim said on Friday he would probably seek a new four-year term as secretary-general of the Organisation of African Unity at the next African summit in June. "Most likely yes, if I get the necessary support," Salim said when asked whether he would seek a new mandate at the OAU's annual summit due to be held in Harare on June 2-4. Salim, 55, was speaking at a news conference at the end of a three-day African foreign ministers' meeting in Tripoli. The Tanzanian diplomat was first elected as secretary-general of the OAU in 1989 and was unanimously re-elected in 1993.
MCAT	Dollar/yen ended lower in quiet trade after fears of Japanese trade surpluses took hold, while a deal struck by European leaders to stabilize budgets after monetary union left dollar/mark limp, dealers said. Against the yen, the dollar continued overnight losses, ending at its session low as the market prepared for swelling Japanese trade deficits to be a hot topic when leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) industrial nations meet in Denver for a three-day summit on Friday. Import/Export data from both Japan and the United States will be released before the gathering.   "The summit is this weekend, hence dollar/yen will probably be more of a focus of trading this week, now that the stability pact is out," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Credit Agricole Indosuez. The dollar ended at 113.24/29 yen, down from 113.66/71 at the open and 114.80/90 at Friday's close. Dollar/mark was at 1.7305/15,off a touch from its 1.7310/20 U.S. open. Figures out Tuesday are expected to show Japan's trade surplus grew in May, while April U.S. data out Thursday are forecast to reveal the opposite -- a wider deficit.   "We continue to view dollar/yen as a politically-charged currency again. Any increase in the surplus should bring in selling pressure on dollar/yen," Flanagan said. But the markets showed little reaction to remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who said on Monday the world wants Japan to open markets more and push financial liberalization. The dollar's four-day rally against the German currency last week ended when profit-taking set in after EU finance ministers reached a compromise deal Monday on limiting budget deficits after the launch of Europe's single currency.   Dollar/mark was also hurt, touching a U.S. low of 1.7280, and dollar/yen was buoyed by a brief bout of mark/yen buying. The budget agreement incorporated French demands for a resolution on employment and growth. Last week, anticipation of an accord bolstered confidence that monetary union would go forward as scheduled in 1999, helping the dollar by raising the odds the mark would lose its dominant role in Europe to a weaker currency, the euro. France and Germany were sharply divided over the issue after France's new left-wing government balked at signing the pact, negotiated late last year.   "The stability pact was signed with very little impact in European trading markets. (It was) pretty much as expected, an addendum with jobs was attached to it," said John Nelson, foreign exchange trading manager at ABN-AMRO Bank. Elsewhere, the dollar inched up to 1.4420/30 Swiss from 1.4415/25 and rose to Canadian $1.3864/69 from C$1.3780/85. The pound also firmed to $1.6368/78, from $1.6360/70.

GCAT	Australia's Mark Woodforde, a losing semifinalist at the Australian Open last year, cheered the home crowd on Thursday with an impressive 6-0 6-1 7-5 win over Argentina's Hernan Gumy. The 31-year-old from Adelaide, who with doubles partner Todd Woodbridge has won just about every honour in the game, served powerfully to blast Gumy out of the tournament in just 99 minutes. Only in the final set did Gumy put up much of a defence, but Woodforde managed to break his serve in the 12th game to take the match. The win earned Woodforde a probable third round berth against world number one Sampras, who was later to meet Adrian Voinea of Romania. Woodforde and Woodbridge last year won 12 doubles titles from 13 finals including a fourth consecutive Wimbledon. They also took gold at the Atlanta Olympics. Both have recently come into their own as singles players. Woodbridge won his first tour event in Adelaide earlier this month and on Tuesday he beat France's Stephane Simian in straight sets to earn a third-round tie with MaliVai Washington of the United States.
GCAT	About 20,000 Rwandan Hutus fleeing rebels in Zaire are trying to cross into neighbouring Congo, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Thursday. A statement from the Geneva-based ICRC said more than 3,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees had arrived in Congo's fishing village of Liranga and several hundred more were crossing by river every day. The ICRC was giving temporary assistance to the Hutus, who were being charged by local boatmen for the passage and those too sick or without money were being left behind. Many were in an appalling state after long treks through Zaire's jungles. The refugees are among the remnants of the Hutus who fled into Zaire from Rwanda in fear of reprisal for 1994's Hutu-led genocide of Tutsis. More than half a million Hutus went home late last year.

ECAT	The Treasury Department's groundbreaking auction of securities designed to protect against the ravages of inflation were brought to an eager market Wednesday. The $7 billion sale of 10-year inflation-indexed notes, carrying a coupon interest rate of 3.375 percent, drew strong bidding that resulted in a high yield rate of 3.449 percent, well under estimates, so that the government was able to borrow more cheaply than anticipated. "We think this is a very good start to the programme that is going to be very big," said Roger Anderson, the Treasury Department's deputy assistant secretary for domestic finance, who helped design and oversaw introduction of the new borrowing instrument. Treasury notes are like savings bonds, but generally cover shorter periods of time. The new notes, sold in minimum denominations of $1,000, will have their principal value adjusted daily based on changes in the widely used Consumer Price Index. Thus, the principal will not be eroded away by rising prices by the time it matures in 2007, as can happen with conventional debt securities. In addition, it offers coupon interest of 3.375 percent, paying half that amount each six months on the then-current principal value. The effect is that, for the first time, an investor is fully protected from rising prices and gets a real, inflation-adjusted return of the amount promised when the security was sold. One measure of the first issue's popularity was the bid-to-cover ratio, which measures the bids received for the notes against those sold. The ratio was 5.31, with $37.2 billion of bids pouring in for the $7 billion of available notes. "We saw overwhelming demand at the last minute," said Scott Graham, a New York-based trader at Prudential Securities Inc. While the bid-to-cover ratio was described as excellent, bidding by individuals appeared to be fairly modest. The Treasury Department reported only $157 million of so-called "non-competitive bids," which generally come from individual buyers. Dealers were apparently the driving force in Wednesday's auction, planning to resell the securities in secondary markets for a profit. Analysts said the public probably needed time to learn about the new security and decide how it would fit into individual investors' portfolios. Retirees concerned about preserving their capital as well as people saving for childrens' education are seen as strong potential buyers because the inflation-indexed feature puts them less at risk if prices begin to escalate. "On the surface, it looks good," said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at broker Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "But since it is a new instrument, you can't compare it to anything. "No doubt it went better than anyone envisioned," Flanagan added. The Treasury Department plans to sell inflation-indexed notes four times a year, with the next sale occurring in April. It will add other maturities besides the 10-year note but no decision has been made yet on whether they will be for a longer or shorter maturity. Treaury Secretary Robert Rubin, a Wall Street veteran, considered the initial inflation-indexed note auction went at "a fair price to the buyer, a fair price to the seller," according to Anderson.
ECAT	The rise in Hong Kong rates on Wednesday to match the rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserves on Tuesday will have little effect upon the territory's growth rates or economy, economists said. Hong Kong rates would have to rise substantially, possibly in excess of 100 basis points, before the economy would start to suffer and there are few signs this will happen, they said. "I factored in this rate increase into my GDP (gross domestic product) forecast of 5.5 percent this year, so if the rate hike is less than 50 basis points, I won't be changing my forecasts," said Kevin Chan, economist at Salomon Brothers. With inflation forecast to rise one percent this year to seven percent from six percent, a 100-basis point increase would be required before Hong Kong's real interest rates started to climb, Chan said. "Even if they raise rates 50 basis points this year there will be a net decline in real interest rates here because of inflation," he said. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased the U.S. Fed funds rate by 25 basis points on Tuesday to 5.50 percent, prompting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - the territory's de facto central bank - to raise Liquidity Adjustment rates by 25 points to between 4.25 percent and 6.25 percent. The Hong Kong rate hike was widely expected because the LAF is used to maintain the territory's currency peg of about HK$7.80 to the U.S. dollar. The Hong Kong Association of Banks followed suit at a special meeting on Wednesday afternoon, increasing regulated short-term deposit rates by 25 basis points. The hike prompted the territory's five major banks immediately to increase their prime and best lending rates to 8.75 percent from 8.50 percent. Sun Bae Kim, senior economist at Goldman Sachs argued that the move in adminstrative rates was much more significant for Hong Kong than the LAF or HKBA rate increase. At 8.75 percent, the best lending rates are well above inflation forecasts of seven percent and could well have an effect -- albeit minimal -- upon private consumption, Kim said. "It might represent better the opportunity costs of money to the person making the decision whether to invest in property or not," he said. "Best lending rates are well into positive territory and that's a more relevant measure." Kim argued that the next rate increase would give a better indication of Hong Kong's resilience to rising rates. Tuesday's increase was expected by markets, but there is nervousness about the U.S. rate outlook. "Traditionally, the Fed under (chairman Alan) Greenspan would not call it quits after one hike, especially one of 25 basis points," he said. "From that end point, I would be watching carefully how the asset markets digest this going forward." Most Hong Kong economists seem to be expecting a maximum U.S. and Hong Kong rate increase this year of 75 basis points, and generally seem to agree that anything more than that could hurt the Hong Kong economy. "Looking at what the market expect right now, there is nothing to indicate an increase of, say, 100 basis points is expected," said Rob Gvozden, economist at Lehman Brothers. "Something like this would have to start being priced in to the property market, the stock market, and we've seen no sign of this," he said. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6470
MCAT	The Iraqi dinar gained against the U.S. dollar and prices of essential foodstuffs fell slightly, traders and money dealers said on Monday. Iraq's dinar currency soared to 1,550 to the dollar from about 1,780 on Sunday and money dealers are expecting a further surge in the volatile currency. The rise in the value of the dinar has already sent down prices of essential commodities. A kg (2.2 lb) of sugar went down to 700 dinars from 850 on Sunday, a kg of flour was sold at 500, down from 600, and a kg of rice, stable diet of most Iraqis, fetched 500 down from 650. Traders attributed the surge in the value of the dinar to a news report in Iraq's official newspapers on Monday saying that Turkey would double its trade volume with Baghdad. The papers, quoting Turkish officials, said Turkey had expanded a border point with Iraq to handle more trucks loaded with foodstuffs to the sanctions-hit Iraq. Ankara puts its current trade with Baghdad at $122 million but the traders said the figure did not take into account the increasing number of Turkish truckers making the cross-border trip to swap goods for Iraqi diesel. Prior to the U.N. trade sanctions, imposed in 1990 because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Turkey's trade with Iraq reached about $2.5 billion a year. The traders also said they expected early implementation of a delayed oil-for-food deal signed by Iraq and the United Nations. Iraq's oil deal with the United Nations allows oil sales worth $2 billion in six months to buy food and medicine. The pact was about to be implemented in September but was halted when Baghdad sent troops to northern Iraq to help one Kurdish faction fight a rival. Early this year Baghdad's oil talks with the U.N. led to spectacular gains for the dinar. From about 3,000 to the dollar it rose at times to 450.
CCAT	Companion Building Material (Holdings) Ltd said it had reached a conditional agreement to buy New World Development Co Ltd's Super Trend Ltd unit in a HK$70.4 million share swap agreement. Super Trend and its units are engaged in the production and sale of ceramic tiles. Companion said it would transfer 55 million shares in its 58.48 percent-owned Companion Marble (Holdings) Ltd, valued at HK$1.28 per share, and rights to receive warrants in Marble to Chi Lam Investment Co Ltd, a subsidiary of New World. Chi Lam would also assign to Companion the benefits of an interest-free loan of HK$239.55 million due to a Chi Lam unit from Super Trend, it said. The HK$70.4 million price is subject to adjustment on the basis that if the net current asset value was less than HK$19.16 million, Chi Lam would pay Companion the shortfall and if it was greater, Companion would pay the excess. Companion said its interest in Marble would be reduced to about 46.23 percent and Marble would cease to become a unit of the company. New World would become a substantial shareholder of Marble and have the right to nominate a representative to the board of Marble. -- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843 6345

CCAT	Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, chairman of Mexican media conglomerate Grupo Televisa, could step down Tuesday from the post he has held for the last three decades, the daily El Economista said Monday. Televisa and its subsidiary Televicentro will hold "special" meetings both Monday and Tuesday to reassign duties and modify the board structure, the paper said. "(This Monday) there is a meeting of Grupo Televicentro and on Tuesday there is another one for Televisa to designate advisors and revoke powers," an unnamed Televisa director told El Economista.   Azcarraga took a medical leave of absence in mid-February and temporarily left control of the Spanish-speaking world's largest media company and dominant broadcaster in Mexico. Since then, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Emilio Azcarraga Jean, Azcarraga Milmo's son, has been responsible for broadcasting operations and Guillermo Canedo White, executive vice president and chief financial officer, has overseen administrative and corporate affairs.   It is not clear if the shareholder meetings will be held to ratify the responsibilities of Azcarraga Jean and Canedo White, or if Azcarraga Milmo will step down definitively. Spokesmen at Televisa were not immediately available for comment. "Changes in the board will include the chairman himself, the invitation to the meetings and the revoking of powers is because of Azcarraga (Milmo)," the source said.   Manuel Alonso, president of news at Televisa, told Reuters ON February 14 that Azcarraga Milmo would stay on at the helm of Televisa, but that he was unlikely to resume his full work load after returning to Mexico. Azcarraga Milmo took his leave of absence for medical care in Los Angeles, after which he rested in his Los Angeles home. Alonso had said the Televisa chairman planned to rest a "few weeks" before returning to Mexico. El Economista said Azcarraga Milmo would not be present at either of the two board meetings.

ECAT	Japan's surplus in its current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, rose sharply in January -- the first increase in 17 months, the Finance Ministry said on Thursday. The fresh data, which showed a surge in the surplus to 150.7 billion yen ($1.24 billion) in January from 32.6 billion yen ($269 million) a year earlier, prompted a quick expression of concern from a U.S. government official. "If this indicates a trend upward, then it would be a matter of concern to us, as Deputy Treasury Secretary (Lawrence) Summers made clear," the official told Reuters in Tokyo. "Clearly the reduction (in the current account surplus) has bottomed out, so there is concern that it might be headed back up," the official added. Japan's surplus in merchandise trade alone, a narrower measure of trade, fell to 229.3 billion yen ($1.89 billion) from 271.3 billion yen ($2.24 billion) a year earlier. The surge in the current account surplus confounded analysts' forecasts, which ranged from a big deficit in the current account to a modest increase in the surplus. In a Reuters poll, the average of economists' forecasts had been for a deficit of 31 billion yen ($256 million). January figures are notoriously unpredictable as the length of the New Year holiday, including weekends, varies from year to year, affecting the number of business days. The contentious current account surplus fell in December for the 16th consecutive month of year-on-year declines. But the pace of the drop has slowed due to the yen's fall since mid-1995, which has boosted exports while discouraging imports. A Japanese Finance Ministry official said after the figures were released that the current account surplus was still falling, but added that the pace of the decline had slowed. "There are two reasons the surplus is going up. One, because the yen has been so weak for the past year and a half and the other is that domestic demand is going to be very dull," said Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING Baring in Tokyo. U.S. officials have begun warning Tokyo against exporting its way out of its current economic woes. Despite low interest rates, the economy has been struggling to gain momentum after a long slump and a tax rise in April may put an even bigger squeeze on the recovery. In a speech last Friday and in a news conference here earlier this week, Summers urged Japan to make sure its economic recovery was led by domestic growth, and that its trade surplus did not bulge again. Summers also said Japan might need to take extra steps to ensure those objectives were met, depending on "how economic events played out". U.S. officials have become particularly worried that Tokyo's plans to reduce its budget deficit, including a rise in its sales tax in April, could undermine growth and hence lead to a resurgence of its current account and trade surpluses. Japanese Finance Ministry officials, meanwhile, have said Tokyo would stick to its policy of ensuring a domestic demand-led recovery and insist that Washington need not fear that Japan's trade surplus was set to balloon after halving since 1994.

A trader said the gain followed positive comments made by an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
CCAT	Eurotunnel Plc/SA, the British-French operator of the tunnel under the English Channel, said Monday its bank lenders had no significant problems with its financial restructuring and it expected the details would be ironed out in time for a shareholder vote by the end of June. "There are no problems with the banks," a Eurotunnel spokeswoman said. Eurotunnel earlier said its bank syndicate had agreed to extend a suspension of payments on 70 billion francs ($12.4 billion) of junior debt to Dec. 14, 1997. The company invoked the debt payment standstill in September 1995 and the freeze would have ended March 14 without the extension. Co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said in January that he hoped to agree on the restructuring terms by March, in time to send documents to its 225-member bank syndicate. "Working parties are studying the details of the various financial instruments and fixing the parameters," the spokeswoman said. That included agreeing on the conditions for implementing the instruments, she said. The payment suspension extension was not related to further bank negotiations but was due to a fire that seriously damaged part of the tunnel in November and disrupted operations. The terms of the restructuring, which had been agreed in principle last October with steering committee banks, need to be concluded by the end of March so that a prospectus could be sent out in April to allow shareholders to vote on the complex package by June 30, the spokeswoman said.

"He told al-Hayat the Canadian government will issue a statement within 48 hours which will give the reasons for deporting him to the U.S.," added the London-based paper, which had published previous interviews with Sayegh from his prison since his arrest on March 18. Sayegh, who had denied links to the June 25 bombing, told al-Hayat earlier this month that he wished to be tried in Saudi Arabia and that he was confident of his innocence. In Washington, U.S. officials said on Monday Sayegh's deportation to the United States was imminent and could happen by Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest. Some said Tuesday was the most likely date for Sayegh's deportation, although they acknowledged it could be delayed by last-minute problems. FBI agents have been standing by in Ottawa to take him to the United States. Sayegh has been identified in Canadian court documents as the driver of a car that gave the go-ahead signal for an explosives-laden fuel truck involved in the bombing. U.S. officials have long sought to question Sayegh about the attack on the compound that housed U.S. military personnel at Khobar in eastern Saudi Arabia. Canadian Citizenship and Immigration spokesman Rene Mercier said the government would only give out details after Sayegh had gone. "We will not be talking about where he is going or when he is going (ahead of time)," Mercier said.
CCAT	Italian financial holding Gemina firmed on the Milan bourse in heavy trade after the stock rose above 1,000 lire in the previous session. At 1418 GMT, Gemina was quoted 3.04 percent higher at 1,020 lire after a high at 1,030, in volume of over 30 million shares. Analysts said there was no real news to drive the price higher but were expecting the group to make capital gains on the hive-off of its industrial interests into a new conglomerate, HPI, expected to make its bourse debut soon. One analyst also cited strong growth in Gemina's Fila clothing company in the second half of 1996, boosted by the dollar's recent rise. New York-listed Fila posted third quarter 1996 net profit of 65 billion lire, up 77 percent, with sales up to 611 billion lire from 435 billion, rising especially in Europe. -- Milan newsroom +392 66129589

ECAT	Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Tuesday that he was confident the government would meet its fiscal deficit and economic growth targets for 1996/97 (April-March). "This year I am determined to keep the fiscal deficit at five percent" of gross domestic product (GDP), Chidambaram told the World Economic Forum. "Nobody believes I will do that. But I am confident we will keep the fiscal deficit at five percent....There is no reason to believe that this government has given up its goal of containing the fiscal deficit." The fiscal deficit, or total net government borrowing, was 5.9 percent of GDP in 1995/96. The finance minister said that during the first five months of 1996/97, tax revenues as a share of total revenues were at the same level as the average of the last five years.   Chidambaram told the business leaders that he expected the government to achieve its target of seven percent annual GDP growth over the medium term by implementing its policy agenda, called the Common Minimum Programme (CMP), drawn up in June. "Seven percent (growth) is not easy to achieve," he said. "If we do not implement the programme sincerely, we will not achieve seven percent." In 1995/96, GDP grew 6.3 percent. The government has a tentative GDP growth target of 6.6 percent for 1996/97. The finance minister acknowledged that it would be hard to push growth beyond 6.0-6.2 percent with the current household savings rate, the existing level of government red ink and the existing current account deficit. But Chidambaram said the government was committed to improving the efficiency of capital, raising the savings rate and attracting large foreign exchange inflows. "We will do every one of these things to raise growth beyond seven percent," he said, without specifying a time period. "I am confident that if we implement the CMP in its letter and spirit, we will be able to achieve seven percent growth."   Chidambaram said six percent GDP growth was not satisfactory, and acknowledged that currently "there is a slight slowdown". But he said industrial production in 1996/97 was expanding at an annual rate of more than eight percent, and predicted agriculture production would touch a new peak this fiscal year. He said the services sector was growing at a reasonable rate. "With the reduction in real interest rates, I expect the economy to pick up," he said. "We have the capacity to grow at seven to eight percent," he said, without specifying the time period. -- New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024
ECAT	Brazil's net foreign reserves stood at $58.287 billion in August, or $59.643 billion according to the international liquidity concept, the Central Bank said. In the first eight months of the year, the current account deficit was $11 billion, or 2.8 percent of gross domestic product, versus $13.1 billion, or 3.5 percent of GDP, in the same year-ago period. The bank said 1996 net foreign direct investment totalled $5.423 billion through August, compared with $3.928 billion in the whole of 1995.   "It is important to stress that almost 50 percent of the current account deficit registered in the January-to-August period of 1996 was financed by direct investment, a participation well above the 16 percent seen in the first eight months of 1995," the bank said. The deficit in services was close to $12 billion, with net interest payments rising by $1.1 billion to $6 billion for the year so far. Other net expenditures on services declined by $1 billion, to $6.1 billion. Inflows of capital from Brazilian companies with investments abroad in the first eight months totalled $2 billion, compared with $2.8 billion in the same period in 1995, the bank said. -- Michael Christie, Brasilia Newsroom 5561-223-0358

MCAT	Philippine shares shot up on Friday after the government announced strong economic growth figures and even though economists said the growth was not high enough, analysts said. "People were probably pleased with the GNP (gross national product) results. In the first place, the market is starved for good news and the GNP result while not too bullish was still favourable," said Francisco Trinidad, research head at DBS Securities Phils. The main index pierced a 2,800 point resistance to close at the day's high of 2,809.45 points, up 51 points and its seventh consecutive rise. After the market had closed on Thursday, the government said GNP had risen 6.1 percent in the first quarter, down on below its own projection of a 6.4 percent rise and lower than the 6.9 percent a year earlier. Economists warned that the government will have a tough time meeting its seven to eight percent growth target for the year. "Although GNP did not live up to the 1996 level, the consensus view was really for a slower growth rate," Patricia Hocson, analyst at Anscor Hagedorn Securities, said. "Hence, a figure lower than the government's expectations may not necessarily be construed as inhibiting the market. Our bet is that this has already been discounted by most players," she added. Other analysts said that first quarter GNP may have dispelled fears that the Philippines is set for a property crash, a battered currency and a general economic slowdown similar to Thailand. Such concerns earlier this month prompted investors, mostly foreigners, to flee the market, hitting property and banking issues. "The Thailand comparison was a big factor in the recent slump of the market. The economic comparison growth figures showed that we are not like Thailand and this improved the market's fragile sentiment," said Allan Araullo, vice-president at Regina Capital Development Corp. Week-on-week, the market barometer gained 211 points, rising almost eight percent from the previous week's 2,598.20. Traders, however, have yet to be convinced of a reversal as market has been trading on moribund volumes. "Next week, we just have to see the market consolidate. Too steep and too fast a runup in the last seven days is just not healthy," said Jidgette Valenzuela, research manager at Lippo Securities.
MCAT	German shares roller-coastered on Monday, falling in electronic trade but rallying strongly thereafter to end bourse higher as the market shook off earlier uncertainties about EMU and the left's victory in France. The DAX index of 30 German blue-chips ended 57.78 points, or 1.63 percent, higher at 3,605.62 points, while the June DAX future contract also recovered strongly, rising 56 points to 3,620 points. Sentiment was hit in early electronic trade by an upset victory for the French left wing in Sunday's election. "The socialists are going to play a more important role in Europe again," said one trader, adding that this had a bad effect on the market. There had also been concern for the stability of the proposed single European currency, the euro, after the Bundesbank and the German finance ministry clashed on revaluing Germany's reserves. "Everything is based around the euro being delayed. If it looked like the euro is in serious danger, then we could have a clear consolidation," the trader said. A Frankfurt broker agreed: "There is a lot of uncertainty about, what with the gold reserves revaluation being debated back and forth and the uncertainty after the French elections. It doesn't add to confidence at the start of the week." "There are numbers coming out of the U.S. this week as well, so you might have people sitting on the sidelines waiting for those," the broker said, referring to NAPM figures today and factory orders figures on Wednesday. "This is not a crash day, but we're not going up anywhere," he said. The strength of the dollar boosted exporters, including the carmakers. Volkswagen AG ended bourse up 25 marks at 1,129 marks, while BMW ended up seven marks at 1,406 marks. Daimler-Benz AG ended up 2.30 marks at 133.80 points.
GCAT	President Bill Clinton's former partner James McDougal was sentenced to three years in prison on Monday after making a deal McDougal hinted might spell legal trouble for the president and first lady. McDougal, 56, could have received a sentence of more than 80 years in prison for his May 1996 conviction on 18 counts of fraud and conspiracy, but got off lightly because of his cooperation with Whitewater independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr. McDougal hinted to reporters afterwards he was giving investigators information that could implicate the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater scandal and urged everyone to "stay tuned" to developments. "I wouldn't go to the bank on that," McDougal said when asked if he believed the Clintons would be exonerated in the scandal, as he maintained during the May trial. U.S. District Judge George Howard recommended that McDougal serve his time in a prison hospital because of a variety of health problems. He also gave him a three-year probated sentence, with the first year to be served under house arrest, and a $10,000 fine. McDougal was set to go to jail on June 16, but he said he would likely appeal the case. Starr argued for a light sentence for McDougal, whom he said was providing investigators "information on a wide range of matters," including items that were previously known only to a "very small group of people." McDougal told Howard he took "full and complete responsibility for my crimes and misdeeds" and said he had "no excuse whatsoever to offer your honour." McDougal has been the central figure of the Whitewater investigation since the start and was closer to Clinton than anyone else brought to trial in the wide-ranging investigation. He came under federal investigation when his Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was declared insolvent and shut in 1989 at a cost of about $65 million to taxpayers. At his trial he was found guilty of using up to $3 million in illegal federally backed loans to help finance several real estate projects. Before his convictions, McDougal regularly ridiculed Starr and his team of attorneys as "Republican henchmen" and said he would never cooperate with them. But he quickly changed his tune after a federal jury found him guilty on all but one of 19 fraud and conspiracy charges. Since then he reportedly corroborated allegations by Arkansas banker David Hale that Clinton, then Arkansas governor, pressured Hale into extending an illegal $300,000 loan to McDougal's former wife Susan. Prosecutors alleged that $50,000 from the loan was funnelled into the flagging Whitewater real estate project in which the McDougals and the Clintons were business partners in the 1980s. Clinton and McDougal flatly denied Hale's allegations and legal experts said Starr's team would have to find corroborating evidence because McDougal's credibility as a prosecution witness would be weak. But McDougal said on Monday he was able to back his allegations. "The documentary evidence will substantiate anything I have said," he said. Starr's team also questioned McDougal on another real estate venture known as Castle Grande. Hillary Rodham Clinton acknowledged performing some legal work for the project, which federal regulators called a "sham transaction," as a private attorney. But she denied wrongdoing. Susan McDougal was convicted with her former husband and was sentenced to two years in prison for her role in the fraudulent loan schemes. But she refused to cooperate with Starr and was serving a contempt of court sentence because she refused a judge's order to answer questions before a Whitewater grand jury. She has said James McDougal told her he was lying to win a reduced sentence and that he urged her to do the same.

CCAT	Ag-Chem Equipment Co Inc said Monday it expects a good spring season for its fertilizer application equipment, but that it is trying to control its inventories. "We had too much inventory at the end of the 1996 spring application season," said A.E. McQuinn, chief executive officer, in a news release. "We have taken a more conservative approach this year." He added that weather has cost several production days for the company and has slowed deliveries at its Minnesota manufacturing facility. "The weather, however, could have a positive effect on the year's results," he said. "Fall fertilizer application was delayed due to last year's late growing season. This was followed by heavy rain and early snowfalls. A prolonged snow melt will compress the time that fertilizer can be applied this spring. When this condition has occurred in prior years, there has been a flurry of orders in March and April if immediate delivery is available." Earlier Monday, Ag-Chem reported net income of $994,000, or $0.10 a share for the first quarter ended December 31, compared to $359 million, or $0.04 a share a year ago.

CCAT	Atlantic Coast Airlines Inc said on Thursday that it will build an 85,000 square-foot aircraft maintenance facility at Washington-Dulles International Airport, the regional airline's hub. The maintenance hangar, which is scheduled to be occupied in December 1997, will be the first airline maintenance facility to be located at Dulles International Airport in Northern Virginia, the company said. To assist with the project, Virginia Gov. George Allen approved a $175,000 Governor's Opportunity Fund grant for Loudoun County, where Washington-Dulles International and ACA headquarters are located. Also, investment support is being provided by the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority and Loudoun County. The balance of the cost for the $10 million facility is being funded through bonds issued by the Loudoun County Industrial Development Authority (IDA). The aircraft maintenance facility will provide 300 jobs with about 233 in Loudoun County, the company said.

A study found that over half of all 16 year olds had drunk black market alcohol and tightening up the laws could cut down this consumption. - Central bank governor Urban Backstrom says a quick link to Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) would be counter productive. He siad there must be strong public support for the move and as this has not been achieved there has been no contact with other European central banks to discuss a possible link even though Sweden's economy is ready. SVENSKA DAGBLADET - Violence among children and teenagers is increasing in line with a rise in the general community.

MCAT	Though outright product prices will ride developments in the U.S.-Iraq confrontation, Gulf fundamentals point to stable middle distillate premiums ahead of the fourth quarter, regional traders said on Thursday. Gulf gas oil (diesel) markets have largely shrugged off Indian Oil Corp's (IOC) decision to cancel its November buying tender and are underpinned by tight supplies, low global inventories and Sri Lankan and Kenyan interest, traders said. October 0.5 percent sulphur cargoes were assessed at $1.00-$1.05 to independent price quotations of around $26.25 a barrel on Thursday, compared to only 30 cents last September.   "For October, availabilities are limited," one trader said. Jet markets were less robust, with Saudi material from the Red Sea unsold and looking for a market in the Mediterranean, traders in the Gulf said. In the absence of Indian demand, superior kerosene premiums were assessed at 55-60 cents to jet quotes of $28.80 a barrel fob Gulf, though higher quality cargoes out of Qatar were offered above $1.00. Traders said Saudi Aramco had approached potential term customers for submissions on their 1997 middle distillate and fuel oil contract requirements.   Contract negotiations for the whole range of Aramco refined products are expected to last to the end of this year during a series of meetings in Saudi Arabia, Europe and Asia. IOC is also moving to tie up product supplies with Gulf producers, with IOC officials due in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi this month to settle terms. Many Gulf traders are expecting the fourth quarter to see prices rally as Asian and European heating fuel demand rises. Gulf gas oil prices rallied 35 percent between October and December 1995 on the back of a prolonged cold spell.   Gulf fuel oil and bunkering markets remained at their highest level since April, tracking firm Singapore cargo markets and healthy shipping demand at Fujairah, which has pushed Fujairah 380 cst prices to eight-month highs. -- Steven Swindells, Dubai Newsroom, +971 4 6071255

MCAT	U.S. municipal bond prices were flat to slightly lower in quiet trading Monday, as players geared up for the week's heavy supply.

CCAT	Noble Roman's Inc, a restaurant franchiser, said Friday it was in default of its $14 million senior credit facility. The company said it is negotiating with Provident Bank to convert a substantial portion of that facility to equity and is negotiating with other financial institutions to have them purchase the credit facility and convert a substantial portion to equity.   "These are complex negotiations and there can be no assurance that they will be successful," the company said in a news release, adding that because of the events, the company's auditors qualified their opinion as to these uncertainties. The company also reported a loss of $3.9 million, or $0.94 a share for 1996, including $880,862 for costs associated with a withdrawn acquisition of a pizza chain in the Northeast, $673,157 from the charge-off of notes receivable, and $874,768 valuation allowance established against deferred tax credits. Comparable figures form the previous year were not immediately available.   In May, the company closed 18 of its restaurants as part of a plan to restructure the company. The company also said Friday it began a new franchising concept in December, with convenience stores selling fresh baked Noble Roman's pizza and breadsticks. So far in 1997, 10 such franchise units have been opened and the company has signed contracts for the opening of about 40 more in 1997, Noble roman's said. The company said it receives up front fees and commissions for each franchise as well as seven percent of sales each month as a royalty. Noble roman's shares were down 2/16 at 13/16 Friday.

MCAT	The Singapore share index finished down on Friday on a dull day despite a pre-National Day rally in Malaysian over-the-counter (OTC) stocks. Malaysia is celebrating its National Day on Saturday. However, the lack of trading interest was evident in the slackening of interest in second liners and blue chips trailing even further behind, dealers said. The key Straits Times Industrials Index fell 9.11 points to 2,153.54 in line with Wall Street's overnight fall. Market volume was a thin 81.52 million shares with losers leading gainers by 186 to 112.

Vinny Testaverde rushed for one touchdown and scrambed 12 yards to set up the go-ahead score by Earnest Byner in a 19-14 season-opening win for the Baltimore Ravens -- the former Cleveland Browns -- over the Oakland Raiders Sunday. It was a special return for head coach Ted Marchibroda, who was head coach of the Baltimore Colts from 1975 to 1979. "To come from behind like that in front of a full house, it probably doesn't get too much better than this," said Marchibroda, who won his first game as head coach of the Ravens after taking the Indianapolis Colts to within one win of the Super Bowl last season. Testaverde was 19-for-33 for 254 yards and was not intercepted. He also rushed eight times for 42 yards. "We played the no-huddle and they couldn't get any rest between plays," Testaverde said. "The crowd pumped us up big time." The game was played before 64,124 fans at Memorial Stadium, the largest crowd for a sporting event in Baltimore. It was the first National Football League regular-season game in Baltimore since December 18, 1983, when the home team was the Colts, who left for Indianapolis after the season. But Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell moved his team to Baltimore this season, breaking hearts in one city and thrilling them in another. Also in a new city is Jimmy Johnson, the former Dallas coach who made a successful debut in Miami when rookie Karim Abdul-Jabbar rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown in a 24-10 Dolphins victory over the New England Patriots. Johnson led Dallas to two Super Bowl titles in five years before taking over in Miami for the legendary Don Shula. "Going into the game, I was nervous," Johnson said. "You never know how a young team will respond. Our owner Wayne Huizenga gave me a game ball and I told our players that this game ball meant more to me than any other game ball than I've ever received." Dan Marino threw for 176 yards as the Dolphins relied on their running game. In San Francisco, wide receiver Jerry Rice had a two-yard scoring run as the 49ers scored all three of their touchdowns on the ground in a 27-11 victory over the New Orleans Saints. Rice, who had five receptions for 88 yards, posted his 10th career rushing score and extended his NFL record with his 157th touchdown. Steve Young completed 18-of-29 passes for 199 yards and carried six times for 52 yards for the Niners. In Jacksonville, Mark Brunell threw for 212 yards and a pair of first-half touchdowns and James Stewart added a late scoring run as the Jaguars surprised the defending AFC champion Pittsburgh Steelers 24-9. Pittsburgh star linebacker Greg Lloyd suffered a season-ending torn left patella tendon in the third quarter when he collided with teammate Rod Woodson. In Denver, John Elway completed 16-of-33 for 183 yards and led the Broncos to four first-half touchdowns en route to a 31-6 rout of tne New York Jets. Neil O'Donnell, who quarterbacked the Steelers to the Super Bowl last season, in his first start for the Jets was sacked eight times and completed just 7-of-13 passes for 50 yards with an interception. At Tampa Bay, Brett Favre threw four touchdown passes as the Green Bay Packers demolished the Buccaneers 34-3, spoiling the debut of coach Tony Dungy. Favre, the 1995 Most Valuable Player who spent part of the off-season in a rehabilitation centre recovering from an addiction to painkillers, hooked up with Keith Jackson in the first half on scoring passes of one, four and 51 yards. Favre tied Joe Namath as the third-fastest to reach 15,000 yards, doing so in 66 games. Only Dan Marino (56) and Jim Everett (64) reached the milestone faster. In Minnesota, Brad Johnson replaced injured starter Warren Moon and hit Cris Carter with a 31-yard touchdown pass with 66 seconds left to lift the Vikings to a 17-13 victory over the Detroit Lions. Minnesota linebacker Jeff Brady intercepted a pass by Detroit's Scott Mitchell at the Vikings' 10-yard line with 20 seconds left to preserve the win. Moon suffered a right ankle injury late in the first half and did not return. In Indianapolis, Jim Harbaugh shook off an arm bruise and threw two touchdown passes, one with 1:54 remaining, as the Colts beat the Arizona Cardinals 20-13, spoiling the coaching debut of former defensive coordinator Vince Tobin. The Colts were victorious in their first game under new head coach Lindy Infante. In Washington, Rodney Peete passed for 257 yards and two touchdowns in the first half and the Philadelphia Eagles held on for yet another close victory over the Redskins, 17-14. The Eagles have won the last eight meetings by a total of 29 points, an average of less than four points a game. In Houston, Steve Bono threw two touchdown passes as the Kansas City Chiefs erased an early 10-point deficit and pulled out a 20-19 victory over the Oilers. Only 27,725 fans showed up in the Astrodome to see the Oilers, who are scheduled to move to Nashville, Tennessee after the 1997 season. In San Diego, John Carney kicked five field goals and the Chargers rushed for 185 yards in a 29-7 victory over the Seahawks. The Chargers have won five straight and nine of the last 10 meetings from Seattle. In St Louis, rookie Lawrence Phillips had two short touchdown runs and the Rams used turnovers to score 19 unanswered points in a 26-16 win over the Cincinnati Bengals.   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, quarterback Dave Brown's fumble in his own territory set up Steve Christie's 34-yard field goal with 4:52 left in overtime as the Buffalo Bills erased a 17-point deficit and beat the New York Giants 23-20. The Giants raced to a 17-0 lead 23 minutes into the game. But Thurman Thomas scored on a one-yard run with 3:14 left in the second quarter and turned the momentum in Buffalo's favour. The Bills dominated the second half, getting a pair of field goals and a 60-yard touchdown pass from Jim Kelly to Andre Reed to force overtime.
CCAT	Puleva-Uniasa's free capital increase will take place from July 7 to August 7, a spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday. Uniasa said in April that shareholders would receive one new share for every five old shares. The new shares will have the same rights as the old ones as of January 1 1997. The firm has also said it would continue the same policy in the following two years, 1998 and 1999. The second issue will give shareholders one new share for four old, while the third issue will give one new share for every three old. -- Madrid newsroom + 34 1 585 8340
MCAT	Sugar prices were dragged down on Tuesday by light physical demand and good supplies, dealers said. "Millers were sellers because they faced rising stockpiles and dull outstation demand," one trader said. In the ready delivery sugar S-30 fell 4-10 rupees to 1,340/1,376 per quintal while M-30 slid 6-10 to 1,370/1,432. Sugar mill delivery eased to 1,270/1,285 per quintal from 1,280/1,295. Overall sentiment was subdued at the close and traders expect further losses due to sluggish demand. -Bombay Commodities +91-22-265 9000
MCAT	Hungarian overnight interest rates closed higher on Friday as market liquidity tightened ahead the December 10 social security contribution payment deadline, dealers said. "The banks are already preparing for the December 10 tax-payment," said Budapest Bank's Sandor Tolonics. "They expect a larger-than-average payment." The overnight market opened at a quote of 22.00/22.75 percent, then substantial money was taken up at 22.5 percent, but later the rates dropped and closed at 22.00/22.25, as a large bank finished borrowing money. On Thursday, the overnight rates moved between 21.625 and 22.125. Dealers said liquidity could tighten further early next week as the social security contribution payments approach. -- Sandor Peto, Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327 4040
GCAT	The Libyan government on Monday announced it has recognised the change that occurred in Zaire, now renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo, Libyan state-run radio reported. "The Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya announces its recognition of the Democratic Republic of Congo and is fully ready to cooperate with it," the radio, monitored in Tunis, quoted the Libyan foreign affairs ministry as saying in a statement. The statement was dated Sunday, a day after Laurent Kabila, leader of Zairean rebels, proclaimed himself head of state, ousting long-ruling president Mobutu Sese Seko, and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Libyan statement made no direct mention of the new leadership in Kinshasa but said the decision was based on the fact that ties with other countries were made "between peoples and not governments." Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi last December expressed support for Mobutu. "The presence of President Mobutu at the head of power in Zaire is the sole guarantee for Zaire's unity," the official Libyan news agency JANA quoted Gaddafi as saying at the time. "If Mobutu disappeared, Zaire's fate would be that of Somalia after Siad Barre and of Yugoslavia after Tito, and Zaire would therefore be a place for instability in the African continent," he added. Somalia and Yugoslavia both plunged into civil wars after Barre and Tito. Mobutu in 1995 visited Libya where he held what he called excellent talks with Gaddafi.
CCAT	Diversified property developer Wing Tai Holdings said on Monday it expects to perform better in the current financial year ending June 30, 1997 than in the previous one. "Barring unforeseen circumstances, the financial performance of the group is expected to be better next year as construction progresses on several of its presold development projects," the company said in a statement on its results for the year ended June 30, 1996. For that year Wing Tai reported a 73 percent gain in net profit to Singapore $145.08 million. -- Singapore newsroom 65-8703080

GCAT	Massachusetts officials announced on Friday they found the official seal to the document that created the Massachusetts Bay Colony 368 years ago. The seal, a blackened clump of beeswax bearing the crest of Britain's King Charles I, was affixed to the first page of the charter of Massachusetts Bay Colony. It was stolen from the state archives in 1984. "This charter document was the founding document of the Massachusetts Bay Colony," William Galvin, Massachusetts Secretary of State, told reporters. "And we are not only entitled by this document actually to our current lands here in Massachusetts, but by the terms of the document it says we're entitled to sea-to-sea. So that's our claim to California." The charter's first page was recovered in 1985, but police 10 miles (16 km) south of Boston in Randolph, Massachusetts, recovered the seal on Wednesday while making a firearms arrest. The police notified the state archives and an expert verified their find which was being kept in a plastic bag. The seal and the charter were put in a vault at the state archives building in Boston, officials said.
MCAT	Thai raw sugar premiums firmed slightly this week on talk that Russia had entered the market and on further offtake by China, traders said. But the market expected the rise to be short-lived, with some estimating that as much as 40 percent of raws supply remained to be exported. Unless trading houses found markets for that sugar soon, premiums would be pressured further when Australian supply started hitting the market in July, they said. "All the output for 1996/97 was committed and is now in the hand of traders. However, some in the industry estimated that up to 40 percent of the raw sugar output has not been exported and that traders were yet to find markets for a large amount of that portion," said a dealer from a major trading firm. An executive at one sugar exporting firm said traders were pushing to sell to China, Russia and the Middle East and that some were trying to move into the Black Sea market, which is not a traditional outlet for Thai sugar. "If they fail, the premiums will head downward. But if they succeed, the sugar demand outlook next year in those regions could be affected," he said. "For Black Sea and Russia, I think we can still be competitive despite their distance. If the profit margin is not too bad, why not? The fact that we are punctual might be one of the reasons to win buyers over," he said. Thai raw sugar premiums for June/July delivery were bid without offers at 0.70 cent per pound over New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange (CSCE) futures on the FOB basis. The premium for July/August was quoted at 0.75/0.85 cents per pound on the same basis compared with 0.65/0.75 cents last week, traders said. So far, the only major sale to the Black Sea area was a recent 28,000 tonne consignment of raws to Ukraine. The vessel Anais Land departed from a Thai port on May 31. About 23,200 tonnes of raw sugar were shipped to China last week and a further 43,000 tonnes was expected to follow between next week and the end of June, traders and shipping sources told Reuters. The market is watching for any development of talk that China is expanding import licences of raw sugar for tolling. -- Bangkok newsroom (662) 652-0642
ECAT	Widespread abuse of fringe benefits made it tempting to consider banning them, but this was not practically possible now, South African Revenue Services Commissioner Trevor van Heerden said on Tuesday. He told the parliamentary finance committee that fringe benefits basically allowed people to reduce their tax liability and all that SARS could do was try to crack down on any abuse. "This makes it very attractive to say: let us ban fringe benefits, because that would make life simpler for ourselves." It would also make it simpler for large employers to attract staff away from smaller businesses, who could not offer better salary packages. "There is much merit in actually banning fringe benefits if it was possible, but I don't think that it is practically possible at this stage." He knew of no other country in the world that used tax legislation to prevent fringe benefits and this could perhaps only be done through labour legislation that did not allow remuneration in kind. -- Parliamentary office +27 21 403-2502
GCAT	Albania's opposition parties, a day after forming a united front, said on Friday they planned a fresh protest in the Adriatic port of Durres at the weekend, despite mass arrests following last week's riots. Judicial authorities said 149 people had been arrested and charged with violence, theft and damaging public property as clashes and protests spread across the Balkan state over the collapse of pyramid investment schemes. Undeterred by the government clampdown and reports of soldiers and special police intimidating people in last week's troublespots, the new opposition forum said it would go ahead with a peaceful demonstration on Sunday in Durres, 40 km (25 miles) west of Tirana. "We are going to hold a protest against the closure of pyramid scheme companies and ask for the return of all money," a Socalist Party spokesman said. The Socialists, six smaller parties and an association of communist-era political prisoners launched a joint Forum for Democracy on Thursday to press for the resignation of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi's right-wing government. The forum has also demanded urgent inquiries into the investment scandal that has thrown thousands of Albanians in despair and shaken the financial credibility of the state. The ruling Democratic Party newspaper Rilindja Demokratike quoted Foreign Minister Tritan Shehu as saying the country was now calm and that soldiers were no longer guarding government buildings in the capital. "But these forces are ready to intervene again if needed," the paper quoted Shehu as saying. The independent daily Koha Jone accused Europe of turning a blind eye to the financial chaos in Albania, saying European ambassadors appeared to be more interested in saving President Sali Berisha's skin than trying to help impoverished Albanians. Social Democratic leader Skender Gjinushi singled out the Council of Europe for criticism, saying: "Its policy of treating Albania as a political experiment must end." A report by the Council of Europe following a disputed general election last May was much more tame than one by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which spoke of widespread irregularities and intimidation. A U.S. State Department report, made available to reporters by the U.S. embassy in Tirana, said Albania's parliament had been elected through "a seriously flawed process". "The government's human rights record worsened during the year," the report said. The police continued to beat detainees, journalists and opposition party members, and the judiciary was subject to widespread corruption, it added. Berisha, facing his biggest crisis since coming to power five years ago, has tried to defuse growing tension by giving assurances that money from two pyramid schemes frozen in state banks would be returned to investors from February 5. Parliament, almost exclusively made up of Berisha's Democrats after they won the general election with an 87.1 percent majority, passed a law late on Thursday in line with the president's pledge, as was expected. But thousands of unsuspecting Albanians, many who have plunged their life savings into the collapsed funds, are likely to be excluded from the payback. Berisha, eager to avoid stoking inflation, has also offered to give some investors savings accounts, or possibly shares in companies, instead of cash -- a suggestion likely to go down badly with investors now left scraping around for enough money to feed their children.

GCAT	Israel approved on Wednesday the building of thousands of new Jewish homes in Arab East Jerusalem despite strong PLO opposition and warnings the project could unleash a wave of Palestinian violence. Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh told reporters a ministerial committee on Jerusalem gave the green light for the construction of 6,500 homes for Jews, with 2,500 to be built in the first stage. Another 3,000 housing units would be built for Arabs. The homes will go up at Jabal Abu Ghneim, called Har Homa by Israel, a tree-covered hill taken by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the project as a move by Israel to alleviate a shortage of housing for Arabs and Jews in the city. Palestinians see it as an attempt to cement Israel's hold over all of Jerusalem. "Our vision of peace includes peaceful coexistence and harmony between Israelis and Palestinians, Jews and Arabs -- and we are following on this principle in our decision today," Netanyahu told a news conference. "We have decided that construction within the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem is something that is exempt from the Oslo (peace) accords," he said, referring to lines drawn unilaterally by Israel and not recognised internationally. Palestinians have charged Israel was trying to pre-empt a decision on the final status of Jerusalem, which is supposed to be decided in future talks that must be completed by 1999. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat called an emergency meeting of his peace negotiating team later on Wednesday to discuss the implications of the decision, an aide said. "The Palestinian Authority rejects this decision and does not recognise the ramifications that may come from the decision to build in Jerusalem," said Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, general secretary of the Palestinian Authority. "This decision is a serious violation to the peace process and a major blow to the agreements," he told Reuters. Palestinians warned the project could touch off anti-Israeli violence in the West Bank and Gaza reminiscent of clashes that erupted in September when Israel opened a new entrance to an archaeological tunnel near Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem. Sixty-one Arabs and 15 Israeli soldiers were killed in the violence, which almost wrecked the Israel-PLO peace process. "What the Israeli government is doing here at Jabal Abu Ghneim and other places...can destroy everything," said Faisal al-Husseini, the top PLO official in Jerusalem. "Everything is ready for an explosion." But Israeli security officials told the committee they believed the Palestinians would bottle their anger, at least until bulldozers began work, Israel Radio reported. Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan said he expected groundbreaking at the site in about two weeks. Edward Abington, U.S. Consul General in Jerusalem, told a news conference before the Israeli decision was announced that the housing plan and other settlement activity would create a "very, very volatile situation". He said the United States sent messages to Israel and Arafat that "we do not want to see any violence" after Israel approves the project. Netanyahu said anyone who resorted to violence over the project would be making a "grave mistake", his spokesman said. Major-General Uzi Dayan, commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank, said the army had not sent reinforcements to the area but had "concentrated troops in the necessary places". Israeli security sources said an army plan in the event of clashes called for deploying tanks and snipers in areas of the West Bank and Gaza still under military occupation. As the ministers met in Jerusalem, Israeli soldiers clashed with stone-throwing Palestinians in the West Bank village of Hizmeh where undercover Israeli troops shot dead a 54-year-old Arab during a raid on a home on Tuesday. Witnesses said no one was hurt in Wednesday's violence.

CCAT	Standard & Poor's said on Tuesday it affirmed its AAA ratings on General Re Corp's (GRN) senior debt and on the financial programmes of General Re Financial Products Corp and removed these ratings from CreditWatch. The current AA plus claims-paying ability rating of National Reinsurance Corp will likely be upgraded to AAA and the A plus senior debt rating of National Re Corp (NRE) will likely be upgraded to AA (with a positive outlook) pending regulatory approval of NRE's acquisition by GRN, based on the implicit support of the General Re group, S&P said.   S&P also said it affirmed its AAA claims-paying ability rating of General Reinsurance Corp. (General Re) and its A1 plus rating on GRN's commercial paper.   S&P said in summary, these conclusions are reflective of the following major rating factors: General Re is the largest professional reinsurer in the United States based on either its $5.0 billion of domestic statutory surplus or its $3.0 billion in net premiums written (which on a pro forma basis with National Re increase to approximately $5.4 billion and domestic $3.3 billion). GRN's strategy is focused on being the premier global reinsurer in the eyes of its clients, employees and owners, and General Re has consistently provided innovative risk solutions and value-added underwriting and financial services to clients worldwide. General Re's history of consistent and significant profitability in operations has surpassed reinsurance industry averages and has outpaced most AAA rated direct writers over the last several years. The company's reported five-year average combined ratio of 102.4 percent is impressive, but its "operating" combined ratio, excluding strong additions to environmental reserves, is significantly better. Such underwriting results and substantial investment returns on $12.8 billion of invested assets have generated a nearly 20 percent return on revenue for the 1990's. In addition to conservative operating leverage of 0.6 times (x), General Re's risk-based capital adequacy on a consolidated global level has been judged to be superior by Standard & Poor's. General Re has been quite conservative in reserving both its pre- and post-1985 business on a global basis. GRN maintains financial leverage (pro forma for National Re) of 4.5 percent and interest coverage of 50x based on projected 1996 numbers. Given the National Re transaction (and Cologne Re roughly 1.5 years prior), General Re seems to have most major pieces of its global strategy in place. S&P recognises that recent stock repurchases are an effective capital management tool, so long as General Re's operating companies maintain superior capital relative to underwritten risks. S&P said the outlook for GRN was stable. S&P expects that the near future will bring continued growth in profitability, despite short-term setbacks in top-line growth at General Re. For 1996, General Re will face relatively flat domestic premium growth, while international volume should expand by 8-10 percent because of the inclusion of a full year of Cologne Re premium volume. Longer-term, the group is expected to restore double-digit premium growth at near-break-even combined ratios, which are more likely to be underwriting profits as the growth rate of environmental reserves continues to contract, S&P said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 6176

GCAT	A German court said on Thursday it had released on bail a suspected Red Army Faction guerrilla charged with helping Palestinian militants hijack an airliner, and with the 1977 kidnap and murder of a German industrialist. The Frankfurt regional court said Monika Haas, 47, had been released on Wednesday night after ruling that the threat of her fleeing her trial was remote. The current trial is the second for Haas. The first was suspended in February 1996 so that she could be treated for a slipped disc. German prosecutors said they had filed an appeal against the Frankfurt court's decision to release her. Prosecutors allege that Haas smuggled weapons, explosives and a detonator into the Spanish island of Majorca in 1977 for the hijackers of a Frankfurt-bound plane. Palestinian guerrillas commandeered the Lufthansa airliner, which was full of German tourists, in a bid to secure the release of Red Army members held in Germany. The pilot was shot dead when the plane landed in Aden, but the remaining 86 hostages were freed when West German commandos stormed the aircraft in the Somali capital Mogadishu. Haas also stands accused of taking part in the kidnapping and murder of industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer. He was found dead a day after the Mogadishu raid. Haas, who lived with her children and worked at Frankfurt university until her arrest in 1994, denied both charges. The Red Army Faction, which succeeded the Baader-Meinhof Gang, waged a campaign of killings, bombings and kidnappings against the West German establishment and U.S. military in the 1970s and 1980s.
MCAT	U.S. gasoline prices jumped higher Tuesday on brisk buying interest in the spot market and the NYMEX rally. Distillate prices, however, showed little movement, as ample supplies kept differentials nearly flat for the day. On the NYMEX, August gasoline jumped 0.98 cent to settle at 58.92 cents a gallon and August heating oil firmed 0.22 cent to end at 53.00 cents a gallon. U.S. GULF Continued steady refiner buying interest buoyed conventional M1 gasoline differentials, according to traders, in the wake of Monday's pipeline scheduling deadline. Prompt regular conventional M1 gasoline changed hands as high as 0.75 cents under the August NYMEX price, up about 0.75 cent from late Monday levels, before slipping back to between about 0.90 and 1.15 cents under the futures by the end of the day. "It's worked its way back down now, but there was some good refiner buying in there today," according to one Gulf Coast trader. Barrels that hit a Colonial Pipeline scheduling deadline Monday evening reportedly traded on an upline basis at 0.25 cent under the August futures, traders said. NEW YORK HARBOR Conventional M2 gasoline differentials also gained, with prompt barrels talked between 2.00 and 2.20 cents under the August NYMEX, a gain of about 0.25 cents from Monday. "There's nothing coming in on the cargo side till the second half of the month," one trader said, which has forced buyers to chase prices up. Cargoes from Europe remained scarce, according to players, with only a handful of deals seen done in the past week. One 60-tonne gasoline cargo reached the U.S. East Coast recently, while another headed to Aruba, traders said. Two small cargoes from France also reached the U.S. in the past several days. MIDCONTINENT There was little news in the Midcontinent markets Tuesday afternoon although trade was fairly active for Group Three high sulphur and regular unleaded gasoline. Differentials for prompt unleaded barrels in the hub firmed about a quarter cent to 1.75 to 2.15 cents a gallon over August NYMEX futures amid demand. Traders said several players found themselves short and jumped into the market. Barrels for delivery by Friday were done at 2.15 cents over the print. High sulphur diesel differentials also firmed by about a quarter cent on short covering to deals done at 0.25 cents below August heating oil futures. Low sulphur diesel held steady 1.75 to 2.00 cents over the print. In Chicago, activity was reported quiet. Prompt unleaded gasoline differentials remained stable at 1.75/2.00 cents over the print. July any month barrels were pegged 1.25/1.50 cents, with any month August at about 0.55 cents over. -- New York Energy Desk +1 212 859 1620
CCAT	Hungary signed on Wednesday ten-year concessions for two national TV channels with Luxembourg-based CLT's Magyar RTL and Swedish-Hungarian consortium MTM-SBS. ORTT announced on June 30 that the ten-year concessions were awarded to Magyar RTL and MTM-SBS. The CLT-led consortium, Magyar RTL, is owned by a consortium of CLT-UFA, Raiffeisen Unicbank, the UK Pearson group , publisher of the Financial Times, and Hungarian telecom company Matav. MTM-SBS is a consortium of the Hungarian-registered company MTM Kommunikacios Rt, TeleMunchen and the majority US-owned company Scandinavian Broadcasting System. Magyar RTL offered 9 billion forints for the commercial channel it won, while MTM-SBS offered the set minimum of 8 billion forints for the other commercial channel. Irisz TV, a consortium led by Central European Media Enterprises of the U.S., which offered 12.5 billion and 12 billion forints for the two channels but failed in both bids, said  on Monday it was challenging the decision and asked a court to forbid the signing of the concession contracts. It said the ORTT had seriously breached the regulations when assessing the bids and violated the tender procedures and earlier on Wednesday it announced it had a "public document" proving that one of the winning tenders was illegal. ORTT Chairman Mihaly Revesz said after the signing he had no comment on the statement and added the case would be settled in court. "I haven't seen (the statement) and I don't have any comment especially as this is an ongoing legal process," Revesz told Reuters. The eight-member ORTT board chose the winning bidders after two rounds of deliberation and said at the time of the decision that one important factor in the decision was the future diversity of Hungary's media scene and that the verdict was unanimous but for one abstention. The franchises are for ten years that can be extended by another five without the need for a second tender. The two television channels will have to start broadcasting on October 7 latest. The decision brought to an end seven years of political wrangling which has left Hungary's media privatisation trailing behind other former communist countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic, which already have commercial national television stations.

GCAT	Colombian guerrillas on Monday demanded an army retreat and the presence of observers as conditions to be met before they would release 60 government troops captured in a barracks attack last month. The demands of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) were sent to the media in Mexico City, where the FARC operates an office. The FARC on August 30 launched a raid on the Las Delicias barracks in isolated and jungle-covered Putumayo province in southwestern Colombia as part of a wider offensive that left about 100 dead. About 60 soldiers were taken prisoner by the FARC, although the exact number was unknown. At least 20 people were killed in a fresh round of fighting on Sunday. The FARC communique in Mexico City said the guerrillas were awaiting a public statement from the spokesman of President Ernesto Samper and expecting the army to clear out a wide area around where the soldiers were being held. Colombian media reports said the area was surrounded by the army. "The mothers of the soldiers should be present on the day they are turned over, as should the national and international media," the FARC said. "We have knowledge that the military high command is planning a rescue of the soldiers ... with blood and firepower." The FARC also complained that the government has prohibited envoys from foreign governments into the area in order to mediate.
CCAT	Carson Inc said on Monday it acquired the Cutex nail-care product line from Chesebrough-Pond's USA Co for exclusive use in the United States and Puerto Rico, in a deal valued at $41 million. Specific terms were not provided. Chesebrough-Pond's is a unit of Unilever Group. At the same time Carson said it refinanced its $40 million senior debt facility, replacing it with a new $100 million facility. Carson said the total Cutex product line generated about $27.5 million in net sales in 1996, equal to about a third of Carson's 1996 calendar revenues. Carson makes hair-care products. Its shares opened at 8-1/4 on Monday, up 1/8.
MCAT	The Indonesian rupiah was stable against the dollar in slow trading on Monday, dealers said. They said volume was a bit thin, with sentiment on the rupiah remaining positive and a further uptrend was expected if no post-election violence emerged in the next few days. Spot rupiah was at 2,430.2/30.7 at 0845 GMT, compared with an opening of 2,431.5/32.0. Tomorrow and today rupiah were at 2,430.5/31.0 and 2,431.1/31.8, respectively. Dealers said liquidity was ample but it had little effect on the rupiah which sustained its positive trend.   Economic analysts said the strengthening of the rupiah reflected the sound fundamentals of the economy. They said traders were concentrating on fundamentals, but the focus in the next few days was on the Moslem-based United Development Party (PPP) meeting this Thursday to decide whether to accept the results of last Thursday's elections. The ruling Golkar won 74 percent and the PPP nearly 23 percent. The PPP claimed there had been widespread irregularities during the polls. Operators were worried over immediate implications for the rupiah if the PPP refused to sign.   "It may be a little bit too early to say all is well and we don't expect further weakness. It's a crucial week, but so far it has been encouraging," one market economist said. "What happens today is a reflection of people coming back to the market after the election," he said. Dealers said liquidity in the money market was a bit tight in the afternoon, with overnight money edging to 10.0 percent from six percent in the morning on local bidding. Overnight swaps were at -0.30/0.25 and tom/next at -0.20/-0.15 points.   One local bank dealer said forward rates eased further on over-borrowing the rupiah earlier. He said ample short-term funds drove forwards lower and was likely to continue. One-month swaps edged down to 11.15/11.50 from 12.25/12.75, two to 23.0/24.75 from 24.5/26.0, three to 35.5/36.0 from 36.0/37.0 and six to 72.75/74.50 from 73.0/76.0 points. The central bank raised its intervention band by one point on Friday to 2,417/2,609 and its conversion band also by one point to 2,417/2,465 on Monday. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
MCAT	The U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center said Friday that it received bids from 10 companies to buy surplus lead at prices ranging from $0.2799 to $0.2995 per pound. The high bidder was Amerway, which bid for 500 tonnes of lead in five lots of 100 tonnes at $0.2995 per pound. The low bidder was Ney Smelting & Refining, which offered to buy 180 tonnes of lead in three lots of 60 tonnes at $0.2799 per pound, the agency said.
MCAT	Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed down on Friday, with turnover falling to 6.21 million lots from 12.67 million. The annual rate for the most active three-day contract tumbled to 3.00 percent from 21.00 percent on Thursday and the seven-day contract ended down at 10.00 percent from 14.32. One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills. Traders said the day's falls were mainly due to a weak domestic A share market in the past two days and no new A share issues early next week, which drew money back to the repo market.   "The rate for the three-day contract was over 20 percent for a few days due to inflated short-term money demand because of new share issues this week," a trader said. "Borrowers only needed money for the short term. When they withdrew, the rates lost their main support and dropped." Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended up on a technical rebound after sharp losses in the past few days, traders said. The most active 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 closed up at 121.99 yuan from 121.33 yuan. Volume of the eight-contract market rose to 4.84 million lots from 3.54 million. - Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004
CCAT	Anglovaal Ltd said on Thursday group earnings in the 1996/97 financial year were expected to increase as the contributions from its underlying industrial and mining companies grew. "Industrial company earnings should grow as...cost-saving and restructuring measures...begin to take effect," Anglovaal said in a statement accompanying its results for the year ended June 30, 1996. It said programmes were underway at a number of companies in the Anglovaal Industries Ltd stable to cut operating costs and improve focus after they experienced tough trading conditions in the second half of the financial year. These programmes included the implementation of an extensive transformation process at food and retail business National Brands, major capital investments at packaging business Consol Ltd's glass plants and the partial unbundling of construction firm Grinaker Holdings. Another cost-cutting programme was the proposed merger of cement concern Alpha Ltd with competitor Blue Circle. The Competition Board last week said it would recommend to government to block the planned tie-up. Anglovaal said earnings from mining operations were likely to rise with the commencement of profitable new operations and higher contributions from Saturn, whose income is based on royalties received the Venetia diamond mine. Venetia is operated by De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. It said "encouraging progress" was being made in the development of the Target gold project, the Nkomati nickel operation, the Forzando coal project and in the Zambian copper belt. Anglovaal on Thursday reported an 18 percent rise in earnings before exceptional items to 784 cents a share in the year to end-June. The dividend was increased 24 percent to 183 cents a share. -- Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003

MCAT	The following is a direct contribution from statistician F.O. Licht in Ratzeburg, Germany. Please address any queries to Helmut Ahlfeld on +00 49 4541 88920. COFFEE: World market for October 3, 1996 Robusta futures in London kept early losses up to the close as aggressive hedge selling by the origins met with very little roaster buying interest. The downside was supported by some scale-down manufacturer buying at the lows. November lost $17 to close at $1,495 a tonne. In New York arabica futures closed higher and the December/March spread widened again to 5.15 cents/lb. This is due to tight nearby supplies caused by the lateness of the crops which is making the period of tight supplies stretched out longer than would otherwise have been possible and is making some roasters and traders uneasy. Trade sources said that there seems to be very little coffee available for October/November even at steep premiums. Under the ACPC retention plan there should be 500,000 bags less of Central American exports but this was to be offset by 1 million more bags from Colombia. However, it is not yet sure whether Colombia can fill the gap due to transport problems. It was said that whatever milds are available are being taken by European roasters who are outbidding US counterparts. FUNDAMENTALS BRAZIL - Brazil's coffee farmers are looking ahead to 1997/98 and based on current flowerings, very early signs are that output in key states will be below the 1996/97 levels. However, a more precise assessment cannot be made before November, when the flowerings have begun setting, giving agronomists a more concrete idea of crop size. But the fact most regions will see an 'off' year in the crop cycle where there is a larger harvest every other year means even at this early stage, that agronomists expect a drop in output. Some predict falls of up to 50 percent in regions that have been hit by dry weather such as Espirito Santo and the Zona da Mata Region in Minas Gerais. Other traders are considering a worst/best case scenario of 21 to 24 million bags. UNITED KINGDOM - UK broker GNI said it expects world coffee production in 1996/97 to fall short of consumption by 4.486 million 60-kg bags. In its October commodity perspective report. GNI said world production in 1996/97 is likely to reach 94.663 million bags, while consumption will climb to 99.149 million bags. GNI added the production shortfall will see world stocks fall to 21.4 million bags at the end of the period, down from almost 40 million bags two seasons ago. However, GNI forecasts that the recent trend of deficit production years will be halted in 1997/98, when production should climb to 103.3 million bags, compared with consumption of 100.6 million bags. ICO - Coffee exports to all destinations by exporting members of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) during August 1996 totalled 5.460 million bags, down from 5.918 million bags exported the same month the previous year, preliminary ICO estimates show. This brought total exports in October/August 1995/96 up to 65.092 million bags, which compares to 59.234 million bags the same period in 1994/95. Brazil's market share in October/August 1995/96 dropped to 17 percent from 25 percent the same period last year, while Colombia's market share reached 15 percent, practically unchanged from last year. Indonesia's exports surged to 4.443 million bags, up from 2.641 million bags shipped the same period the previous year. NORWAY - Norway imported 52,895 bags of coffee in August 1996, 13 percent more than was imported the same month the previous year. That brought total imports since the beginning of 1996 up to 513,100 bags, 25 percent more than was imported the same period in 1995. Total imports in calendar year 1995 dropped sharply by 18 percent to 662,100 bags. Major suppliers of green coffee in January/August 1996 were Guatemala (71,600 vs 10,100 bags), Mexico (65,300 vs 54,300 bags), Brazil (104,300 vs 172,400 bags) and Colombia (111,300 vs 73,600 bags).
CCAT	The move by South Korea's two largest carmakers  to inject cash into a core unit of the troubled Kia Group signals  a joint effort by existing auto companies to block newcomer Samsung,  analysts said on Friday. Kia announced on Thursday that Hyundai Motor, the country's largest  carmaker, and unlisted Daewoo Motor Co had agreed in principle to  buy stakes in Kia Steel Co, a specialty steelmaker that is one of  Kia's weakest affiliates. Kia Group's flagship is Kia Motors Corp. Under the agreement, Hyundai, Daewoo and Kia would form a consortium  with each having equal stakes to run Kia Steel. A Kia statement said  the three companies had agreed to start working-level negotiations  to sort out details. Analysts said the agreement, which would ease pressures on Kia in  negotiations with creditors, underscored concerns about Samsung Group's  entry into South Korea's crowded car industry. "What this highlights is the growing alliance between the three companies.  There is a lot of bad blood between Kia and Samsung," said Hun Sok  Kang, auto analyst at ING Barings. Henry Morris, managing director of Coryo International (H.K.) Ltd,  said Hyundai and Daewoo made a key defensive move. "They wanted to keep Kia Motors from falling into the hands of Samsung.  This also gets the public used to the idea of them assisting Kia,  possibly paving the way for them to make a bid for Kia Motors," Morris  said. While Samsung has consistently denied any interest in acquiring Kia  Motors, it was a leaked internal Samsung report suggesting the need  for restructuring the country's auto industry that accelerated Kia  Group's current crisis. Samsung has said it would begin producing passenger cars from next  March with production reaching 80,000 units in the first year. Analysts said Samsung was still interested in acquiring Kia Motors  as a short-cut into the industry's top ranks, although public opinion  may cause it to delay revealing its interest. "Samsung is not going to give up. Right now Samsung is doing everything  it can to facilitate takeover of Kia," said Nam Seung-soo, auto analyst  at Daishin Economic Research Institute. "Given what has been happening, Samsung would want to wait for things  to quiet down," said Kang of ING Barings. The agreement on Kia Steel came on the eve of a crucial meeting of  Kia creditors to discuss steps on the fate of the embattled conglomerate.  Creditors were set to meet at 0600 GMT. Kia creditors failed to produce a detailed bailout plan at a meeting  on Wednesday after ruling that the group's self-rescue plans were  not sufficient. Creditors put Kia Group under their protection on July 15 after determining  that Kia affiliates were on the verge of defaulting on debt payments.  Kia's debts totalled 9.5 trillion won ($10.6 billion) as of the end  of May. Creditors have demanded that executives of the eighth-ranked business  resign and that Asia Motors, the group's commercial vehicle maker,  be sold. In a desperate move before Wednesday's meetings, Kia announced harsher  self-rescue measures, including a cut in the number of its domestic  units to five from the current 28 through sell-offs, mergers and spin-offs. Kia also said Asia Motors would sell off part of its assets before  being absorbed by Kia Motors to serve as assembly plants. But creditors  said they worried that the plan would worsen the financial status  of the flagship. ($1 = 890.80 won)
MCAT	CME live cattle futures held gains late, bolstered by the strong tone to cash cattle markets while feeder cattle finished steady to lower but off the day's lows, traders said. Live cattle closed up 0.050 to 0.275 cent per lb with June up the least at 65.225 cents as late fund rolling pared gains. Feeder cattle ended unchanged to 0.150 cent a lb lower with August off 0.025 at 76.925 cents after setting a new high of 77.100 cent. Live cattle moved higher, buoyed by recent gains in wholesale beef prices and this week's higher cash cattle prices. Traders shrugged off news that beef prices slipped at midday, with USDA quoting boxed beef cut-out values down $0.57 to $0.94 per cwt after several days of gains. Those gains pushed beef prices on Tuesday to their highest level since December 4, 1995. Overhead resistance and fund rolling clipped gains late in the live cattle pit, traders said. Start of the "Goldman roll", rolling of long June positions into August by various houses for Goldman Sachs added to overhead resistance from an expected break in cash markets going into summer. Expectations cash markets were at or approaching a near-term top kept a lid on the market, traders said. Retailers are almost finished booking beef for Memorial Day advertisements. As a result, beef prices could ease and bids could be pressured for fed cattle next week or the following week, some sources said.   Choice-type cattle sold at $69 per cwt Wednesday, the highest level since late February, and could reach $70 by next week before prices start a summer decline. Next week Friday's Cattle-on-Feed report is expected to confirm high on-feed supplies. Early indications on the report point to likely larger and possible record-large on-feed supplies, they said. No matter what the percent of placements during April, "the fact remains we have a hell of an increase on feed versus a year ago," said Chuck Levitt, senior livestock analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. "We are going to have increasing numbers into the summer period from the late spring." Cargill Investor Services, Refco, Dean Witter and FIMAT Futures USA notably bought August and sold June, traders said. ADM Investor Services, LIT division of First Options, R.J. O'Brien and ABN Chicogo Corp bought while RBH sold early. Losses were pared late in the feeder cattle pit as corn futures set back, traders said. Prices had been dragged down by local profit-taking early with commission house closing sell stops weighing on August late. This offset rolling of long May positions into August, traders said. Although the latest CME feeder cattle index slipped, overall demand for feeders remains strong, they added. The latest CME feeder cattle index was off $0.14 to $73.20 per cwt. However, feeder cattle prices at the key Amarillo market this week were up $1.00 to $2.00 per cwt, USDA reported and at Oklahoma City, prices were firm to $2.00 higher. Refco bought August at the close. R.J. O'Brien bought May early. E.D.&F. Man and LIT division of First Options spread long August/short May and Refco spread long October/short May, pit sources added.

ECAT	The economies of the Pacific region will grow slightly faster in 1997 and 1998 while inflation will continue to decline, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) think-tank said in its annual forecast released on Tuesday. "The Asia Pacific region is forecast to achieve a weighted average real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 4.1 percent for 1997 and 1998, following four percent growth in 1996," the PECC said. "The best way to describe such an outcome would be as a high and sustainable plateau," it added. It noted much of the growth acceleration in 1996 was the result of stronger economic performances in Japan and the US. "Excluding Japan and the the U.S., real GDP growth is expected to jump from 5.0 to 5.5 percent in 1997 and to 5.7 percent in 1998." The forecast said the excellent inflation performance of 1996 was not a fluke. The weighted average rate of inflation fell to 3.6 percent from 5.2 percent, with Russia excluded, the PECC said. "Further improvement in inflation is forecast," it added. The PECC said there were some economic problems in the region, "But they appeared to have captured all of the media attention." Turning to individual economies, the PECC said, "Inflation is forecast to rise in both Indonesia and Vietnam, but the levels are well within the range that both economies have been able to manage in the past." But it said, "...the financial situation in Russia is so unsettled that price stability is not in view." "Monetary authorities can correctly claim victory against inflation, but they cannot end the fight. While they are responsible to prevent a resurgence, however, they are getting help from developments in the world econmy,' it said. The PECC is a non-governmental organisation devoted to economic cooperation in the Pacific Rim. The report covered 20 countries.
GCAT	The Immigration and Naturalisation Service said on Sunday it did not know that one of the men charged with plotting to bomb New York subways was a suspected Islamic extremist when he was released from custody in February. "We had no information whatsoever this man was a terrorist," INS spokesman Brian Jordan said. He also said that an immigration judge, who was not part of the INS, made many of the decisions in the case of Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, including granting an asylum hearing and lowering his bail. New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani complained on Saturday that the INS should not have allowed Abu Mezer, 23, to be released after he asked for asylum on grounds that Israel would persecute him as a suspected member of a "known terrorist organisation." "I think it is appropriate to question why this person was allowed into the country announcing that he was part of a terrorist group in Israel," the mayor said. Mezer and Lafi Khalil, 22, were arrested in a Thursday morning raid of a Brooklyn apartment where five bombs were found. Police said they shot the two suspects in the raid as they reached for weapons. According to Jordan, the INS let Abu Mezer return voluntarily to Canada the first two times they caught him trying to illegally enter the country through the state of Washington. But the third time, in January 1997, they detained him. According to a U.S. Justice Department official, Canada refused to allow him to return because Abu Mezer had been convicted of using stolen credit cards and assault in Canada. Jordan said the INS then tried to deport Abu Mezer to a third country, but "for reasons we still can't understand" the immigration judge lowered his bail from $15,000 to $5,000. Another Middle Eastern man, who is in jail on unrelated charges, paid the bail, immigration sources told Reuters. In April, Jordan said, Abu Mezer asked for political asylum. The judge agreed to a hearing in January 1998, but in June Abu Mezer withdrew the request for asylum and was given a standard 60 days to leave the country, Jordan said. Whether the men were acting on their own or were supported by another group remains an important issue in the investigation. Law enforcement sources said the suspects were using phones in their local laundromat and grocery store to call the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas. Hamas denied any link.

MCAT	Swiss shares posted their third consecutive record close which was partially due to merger and spin-off rumours in the financial sector, dealer said. The prospect for low interest rates, a firming tendency in the U.S. dollar and early Wall Street highs also bolsted prices. CS Holding once again took center stage, adding one Swiss franc to 194.25 francs despite trading ex-dividend of four francs. One trader the market was abuzz with rumours about a forthcoming "important statement" from the company. A CS Group spokeswoman, however, said it was company policy not to comment on market rumours. The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) ended up 12.7 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,251.2. and the broad Swiss Performance Index (SPI) added 14.28 points, or 0.43 percent, to 3,327.99. Bourse volume stood at 2.37 billion francs. Demand was also high for major banks SBC and UBS, which both jumped by more that one percent. Inspection company Surveillance slumped 100 francs to 3,150 after saying on Wednesday said it expected 1997 group net profit to be below 1996 levels. Major industrials Roche and Novartis consolidated marginally after recent gains. Roche gave up five francs to 13,155. Insurers also generally gained strength after shaking off early doldrums. Swiss Re and Winterthur were up more than one percent each, while Zurich was only slightly higher, adding one francs to 534. Dealers said there was some profit taking in the stock after its recent which bull run. Shares of conveyor belt manufacturer Interroll closed ther first trading day at 246.50 francs. The stock began at 250 francs, above the issue price of 235 francs.
GCAT	The United States asked Sweden on Sunday to help gather information about North Korea's allegations they had arrested an American for spying, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said. "We are aware of the reports," McCurry told Reuters shortly before President Bill Clinton left for Hartford, Connecticut. "The charge (d'affaires) of the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang is making inquiries on behalf of the United States on the status of this individual," he added. The Swedish charge d'affaires represents U.S. interests in Pyongyang, which has no diplomatic relations with the United States. Earlier in the day the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Evan Carl Hunzike was arrested on Aug. 24 inside North Korea after he crossed the Amnok River. KCNA did not say why it took more than a month to announce the arrest and did not provide further details of the man, other than to say he worked for South Korean intelligence. A spokesman at the U.S. embassy in Seoul said earlier: "We're trying to determine if he's a U.S. citizen. As far as I'm aware, this hasn't been determined yet." A spokesman for South Korea's Agency for National Security Planning said: "We've never heard of the name. The allegation was made up by the North."

ECAT	Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Thursday the government would not be influenced by initial issues identified in its financial sector inquiry when making final recommendations. "It is appropriate for the government not to pre-judge any of the issues identified by the inquiry at this stage," Costello said in a statement.   The inquiry, headed by prominent businessman Stan Wallis, left open the option of mergers among Australia's big banks and takeovers of local banks by foreign banks in an interim discussion paper released earlier on Thursday. The paper said the key aim of any reforms should be to increase the efficiency of Australia's banks to compete globally. It also said new technology would transform the sector. Policy set by the previous Labor government has stopped mergers or foreign takeovers of Australia's four largest banks and its two largest insurance and superannuation groups.   The inquiry's final report is scheduled for release in March next year after further reviews. -- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730

GCAT	Former Australian Labor senator Mal Colston, seen a key player in the Senate power balance, said on Tuesday that he was likely to vote against the government's new labour relations legislation when it comes before the Senate later this year. But he said he he had yet to decide which way he would vote on the government's legislation to sell a third of telecommunications firm Telstra Corp.   "I've indicated fairly clearly that I'm disinclined to support the industrial relations legislation," Colston said in an interview with Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. Colston resigned from the opposition Labor party on August 20 to become an independent and was voted deputy president of the senate with the support of the governing Liberal and National parties. The government currently is two votes short of a majority in the senate and Colston's new independent status was seen by the government as improving its chances of passing legislation such as the Industrial Relations and Telstra bills.   Colston said in his resignation letter, his only public statement before this interview, that his Senate voting patterns would be influenced by his long-held Labor beliefs and by his acceptance that the government had an electoral mandate to pursue a number of issues. The Liberal-National coalition government elected on March 2 campaigned to reform industrial relations laws and to sell a third of Telstra. "I think it's fairly clear it has a mandate for its industrial relations legislation, but I'm not going to support that," Colston said.   He said he had some concerns about the Telstra sale bill, which has already been blocked once in the Senate, but that he had not made a decision yet. "At this stage I'm not indicating which way I'm looking at the Telstra issue," he said. Colston said he was taken aback by reported comments from Telecommunciations Minister Richard Alston on Sunday that the government would eventually sell all of Telstra. But Prime Minister John Howard's comments on Monday that the government was only committed to a one third sale had corrected that, Colston said.   Fellow independent senator Brian Harradine was widely reported on Monday as being concerned by Alston's comments and was reconsidering his position on Telstra. Colston, a senator from Queensland, said he was concerned that Telstra employees working outside metropolitan areas in Queensland continue to do so once it is privatised. He said also it was not clear that the Telstra sale was one of the issues the government had a mandate for.   "I don't think it's as clear as that because that partial sale of Telstra is tied up with a number of other things and I'm not prepared to say at this stage there's a clear cut mandate, but I'm not prepared to say there isn't," he said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800

CCAT	Sri Lanka's Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday it had found the directors of Kelani Tyres Ltd guilty of malfeasance for failing to disclose a big fall in its audited 1994 profit. "The (SEC) determined that the directors of Kelani Tyres have been guilty of malfeasance by their failure to comply with their Continuing Disclosure Obligations as required by the rules of the (SEC) and the Colombo Stock Exchange," it said in a statement. "The Commission also strictly warned the directors against any repetition of such conduct," it added. The directors conceded, at an inquiry held by the SEC, that although unaudited accounts for the year ended March 31, 1994, released to the public on June 26, 1994, indicated a profit of 19.3 million rupees, a later audit revealed the profit at 1.6 million rupees, the statement said. The directors also admitted that although the audit had been finalised by August 30, 1994, and was approved by the board on September 1, 1994, they had failed to inform the public of the changes until October 31, 1994, it said. An SEC official said there was no penal sanction or fine attached to the finding of malsfeasance

MCAT	Tel Aviv stocks closed higher on Thursday in rising turnover following the gains posted by Israeli shares traded in the United States, traders said. The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 1.56 percent, or 2.96 points. to 192.33 on all share turnover of 80 million shekels against 61 million on Wednesday. The Maof 25 blue chip index gained 1.42 percent to 202.16. "The rise of Israeli shares traded on Nasdaq was the main reason for today's rise.

"The mood in the market has improved and turnover is rising but it is still too early to talk about a positive change," Nahum added. "Activity has improved after two weeks when turnover averaged around 40 million shekels. The market was reacting to the rise of Israeli shares on Nasdaq and the positive mood in the other stock markets abroad," said Yoram Ben Yaeir at Ahrayut Investment Management. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the most active share, surged 4.5 percent to 144,891 on volume of 10.6 million shekels, after its American depositary receipts traded on Nasdaq gained 5.5 percent on Wednesday.

ECAT	About 10 countries, mainly from Asia, are likely attend a meeting in Tokyo on Monday hosted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help Thailand cope with its economic woes, an financial industry source said on Friday.   The countries will likely include Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, the source said. Another financial source said the meeting will also be attended by the United States. The meeting, expected to start from around 10 a.m. (0100 GMT) at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, will discuss details of an economic rescue package for Thailand's ailing economy. The first source said he did not expect any concrete agreement on the amount of money Thailand will get from the IMF and other countries to address its economic woes during the meeting. Rather, the meeting will be mainly for Thailand and the IMF to explain to potential donor nations what steps Thailand will implement to improve its economy and what would be needed to help the country, he said. Asked whether the countries participating in the scheme will be limited to the 10 countries that will be attending the meeting, the source said he did not know. An international monetary source said the IMF will be represented by Deputy Managing Director Shigemitsu Sugisaki, in place of IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus.

ECAT	British consumers continued to borrow heavily in October to finance strong retail spending, Bank of England figures showed Friday, suggesting retailers were in for bumper holiday sales. Britain's Central Bank data showed net consumer credit dipped to 856 million pounds ($1.44 billion) in October from 1.041 billion ($1.74 billion) in September. Economists said despite the decline, the figures were still robust, although a return to the debt-financed boom of the 1980s was unlikely, with a debt overhang from the recession keeping a lid on consumers' ability to borrow more. "Consumers haven't really paid off any debt since the trough of the recession... so there's not the same scope to take on more in the coming year," said HSBC economist Jonathan Loynes. "That's one crucial reason why we're not heading for a repeat of the 1980s boom." The figures provide further evidence that demand is strong in the British economy and that interest rates might have to rise further to prevent a resurgence in inflation. In recent months consumers have steadily returned to the shops, with economists predicting this trend will continue over the next year or so. Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said in his budget speech on Tuesday that consumer spending would grow by 4.25 percent in 1997. He nevertheless predicted that underlying inflation would remain under control, dipping to 2.5 percent in 1997 after surging unexpectedly to 3.3 percent in October  -- a forecast greeted with some scepticism by economists.
CCAT	Home Centers Ltd said Wednesday that revenues in May increased 62.7 percent to 31.1 New Israeli Shekels (NIS) up from 19.1 NIS. On May 31, 1997, one U.S. dollar equals 3.394 NIS. Home Centers is an Israeli chain of warehouse-type home improvement centers.
CCAT	British mobile telephone company Cellnet on Friday reported strong growth in its customer numbers, confirming the British cellular market is healthy, already indicated by figures from rival Vodafone Group. Cellnet, jointly owned by British Telecom and Securicor Group, said it had 2.68 million UK customers at the end of 1996, up from 2.3 million a year earlier. Vodafone, the market leader in Britain, on Thursday reported a 20 percent increase in UK subscriber numbers over 1996 as a whole, reaching a total of some 2.8 million in December. The market has settled down after a period of very rapid expansion at the beginning of the decade when mobile phones were a novelty. However, analysts were impressed by the figures from Britain's two largest cellular companies and said there were signs of an increase in the rate of subscriber growth. "Vodafone's performance was particularly creditable since historically they have done badly in Q4 while Cellnet did well, due to Cellnet's relative focus on the consumer market," broker SBC Warburg said in a research note. Vodafone gained a net 146,000 UK subscribers in the last three months of last year once cancellations had been taken into account and said that its performance was an improvement on the corresponding 1995 quarter. Vodafone shares added 4p to 244p on Friday, reversing the losses suffered in a generally weak market on Thursday. Cellnet said its subscriber base had grown by 143,000 in the last three months of last year, against an increase of 215,000 in the Christmas quarter of 1995. But Cellnet said that 1995 had been a bumper year and noted that the growth in its customer base was significantly higher than in the two previous quarters. Both Vodafone and Cellnet are in the process of transferring their customers from older analogue networks to more efficient digital systems. Vodafone said that more than 1.2 million of its UK customers were now on the digital network while Cellnet said it had over 880,000 digital customers. One-2-One and Orange ORA.L, which offer only digital services, are due to release their connection figures next week. Orange shares were 2.5p higher at 188p on Friday.

MCAT	European debt futures are doomed to fail in any attempt to chart new highs before the year is out, technical analysts said on Friday. A sharp sell-off, sparked by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, inflicted some serious damage to technical analysts' price charts, leaving the outlook bleak until early 1997. "There is a serious correction going on, and we've seen some heavy technical damage," said Guenter Redeker, a chartist at Chase in London. "This implies that for the next four weeks we will definitely not see new highs in the market." Just days after debt futures across Europe powered to fresh all-time highs, a warning from Greenspan that financial markets were showing signs of "irrational exuberance" sent bond prices plummeting early on Friday. German Bund futures plunged 86 basis points at the open, shadowing a 1-1/2 point fall in the U.S. long bond overnight. French notionnel futures cracked through a medium term upchannel, leaving a large gap on daily price charts and signalling more weakness ahead, while March gilt futures also tumbled through technical supports. Analysts said it was still too early to tell whether 1997 would be a year for bond bears or bulls, but said charts showed that a rally into the end of this year was pretty much out of the question. "The jury is still out on the overall trend, but for the rest of December we've done some pretty heavy damage and are going to struggle a bit," said Karl Haeling, director of futures and options for Germany at DMG Futures and Options in Frankfurt. Coming so close to the end of the year, Haeling said Friday's stinging fall would prompt players to get out of the market, taking their profits for the year while they could. "Few buyers are going to step up and take on more risk. People will be looking for any upmove, saying "hey here's my chance to get out'," he said. In Bund futures, Europe's benchmark market, Chase's Redeker said 100.08 was a key retracement level. The March Bund contract was trading at 100.00 by 1122 GMT, down 70 basis points on the day. "If the market can stabilise and manage to close above 100.08 today, then I would start looking for a bottom building process," he said. But after such a sharp setback, the market will need time to consolidate. "It will take a period for the market to build a solid platform," said Redeker. If Bunds failed to hold above that level, the risk was for more profound weakness, with downside targets at 99.75 and 99.00 luring the contract lower, chartists said. In T-bonds, where the technical pain came hot on the heels of Greenspan's words and swiftly infected European markets, chartists said an important pattern on weekly price charts was the key to the outlook. "We've had an outside week. That means the market is rejecting the upside," said Gerry Celaya, senior technical analyst at American Express Bank in London. An outside week pattern occurs when charts show a higher high and a lower low than were plotted in the previous week. March T-bond futures, trading in automated business before the U.S. market opens, were more than one full point lower at 113-06 by 1123 GMT. Technical analysts said 112-09 was a critical level for this market, since it represented a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from early September at 105-14, to Tuesday's high at 116-17. If that level is broken, more sharp declines are on the cards for U.S. debt futures, with T-bonds on the road to 110-23, chartists said.
CCAT	Swedish ferry operator Stena Line AB posted on Wednesday mounting losses for the first half of the year, blaming currency losses and delays in new ferry deliveries for its poor six-month performance. The company posted a loss of 560 million crowns for the first half of the year, down from a negative 350 million crowns in the same 1995 period. The loss for the first seven months to July had been 340 million crowns, Stena said in a statment.   "In addition, volume growth and price levels have not been strong enough to compensate for increasing capacity and market costs," Stena added. Passenger volumes grew eight percent in the first half of 1996 while the number of cars transported rose 10 percent. Freight volume fell by one percent. Passenger volumes on Stena's British lines rose by 9.0 percent and car traffic rose 12 percent. Virtually all the increase was attributed to higher demand on the Dover-Calais route as cross-Channel traffic rose sharply. Stena said its market share of car traffic volume -- including Eurotunnel -- rose by five percentage points to 18 percent in the six-month period. Stena said high-season traffic across the Channel had been dominated by heavy price discounting and this would effect third-quarter results. -- Simon Haydon, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700-1004

GCAT	A bribery scandal over a former South Korean defence minister has cast a pall over a military establishment already troubled by a legacy of corruption and accusations of security loopholes, analysts said on Sunday. South Korea, its image already tainted by bribery scandals involving two former presidents, was hit by a fresh scandal on Saturday over a defence minister who lost his job in a sweeping ministry reshuffle on Thursday. President Kim has launched an investigation into allegations of bribery against the former defence chief, Lee Yang-ho, who was replaced by retired four-star army general Kim Dong-jin in the shakeup that carved deep into the military's top brass. Lee has denied the charge brought by the main opposition party that he leaked classified military information on a combat helicopter project to an arms dealer in 1995 in return for 150 million won ($181,000) in bribes. But the investigation is the latest in a string of setbacks for the military, which has undergone a radical face-lift since Kim took office in February 1993 under a crusade to root out corruption and end Seoul's legacy of military-backed rule. Kim, the first civilian president in three decades, has attempted to cleanse South Korean politics by retiring generals tainted with scandals and shady deals, arresting officers on charges of bribery and pushing out defence ministers. But some critics say the purge has syphoned away expertise in the military at a time of escalating threats and provocations from communist North Korea, creating loopholes in national security that Pyongyang has recently exploited. Recent criticisms focus on the failure to detect a North Korean Shark-class submarine which glided unnoticed last month through South Korean defences to deliver 26 agents into a sparsely populated area on South Korea's east coast. The vessel may have sailed home, mission accomplished, had not an alert taxi driver spotted its coning tower looming out of the darkness off a beach. The agents fled into nearby mountains where 22 were killed by southern troops or found dead and one was captured alive. The military's failure in a subsequent hunt by thousands of southern troops to find the remaining three, who are suspected of killing three villagers, further undermined confidence. On September 23, only five days after the submarine was discovered, a South Korean army deserter was captured after opening fire and wounding nine of his fellow soldiers. "People have been in a worrisome state after seeing the submarine incursion, along with little progress in the manhunt for the following one month and a desertion case," the Joong-Ang Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial this week. Lee, whose removal from the defence post along with a shift in the commanders of all three South Korean armies last week, was widely seen as a response by President Kim to restore confidence in the military by ushering in new blood. But Kim faces an uphill task. His military suffered another embarassment only five months before the submarine incident when a North Korean air force captain who defected in an ageing Soviet-built fighter exposed gaping security holes in South Korea's air defences. A series of security lapses allowed Li Chol-su's Mig-19 to scream towards Seoul without raising any alarm in the capital. He was eventually intercepted by several southern fighters which guided him to a military air field. At the time, Seoul's mayor apologised for the failure and stripped three civil defence officials of their positions.
ECAT	The Italian economy, which slowed to a snail's pace in the first half of last year, grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 1996, the government said Tuesday. The national statistics office Istat said gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.7 percent in the third quarter compared with the 1995 period and 0.6 percent compared with the second quarter. Preliminary data released in November pointed to a 0.5 percent increase in both cases. "The increase in GDP...confirms that the Italian economy is on the road to recovery," Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni said in a statement. GDP measures the output of goods and services within a country's borders. Over the first three quarters of the year, the economy grew 0.9 percent against the same period in 1995, with the construction, agriculture and service sectors all showing gains while the industry sector declined 0.4 percent. Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left government has forecast growth of 0.8 percent for 1996 as a whole and an Istat spokesman described this goal as realistic Tuesday. Early data has pointed to industrial output increasing in both October and November but the final quarter of the year has two fewer working days than the fourth quarter of 1995, which will depress the overall GDP figure. However, Enrico Giovannini, head of the Istat department which compiles GDP data, said the 1996 target could be hit even with around zero growth in the last three months of the year. This would come as a relief to the government, which has repeatedly revised its economic forecasts downwards in the face of faltering industrial production, strong lira gains and stringent Bank of Italy monetary policy at the start of 1996. The economy actually shrank in the second quarter of 1996, as imports tumbled and exports stagnated. But a turnaround came in the third quarter, with imports up 1.1 percent compared with the quarter before and exports up 2 percent. "This inversion of the trend is typical of an economic recovery," Istat's Giovannini said. Prodi's government is sticking to forecasts of 2 percent growth this year but most economists say that is optimistic given the 1997 austerity budget, which was approved by parliament last month and includes a number of tax hikes. Further tough budgetary measures will almost certainly be needed early this year to cover a bigger-than-expected public sector deficit in 1996, due in part to the sluggish economy. The Italian employers' organisation Confindustria and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have predicted growth of 1.2 percent in 1997.
ECAT	Bank of England Governor Eddie George strongly advised Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to raise UK interest rates by a quarter point at their January 15 monetary meeting. George said there was a good case for a half point tightening, but said the Bank would not press the case. "The Bank still thought it was likely that a monetary tightening of a half of a percent would be need fairly soon to moderate the growth of domestic demand," the minutes show him as saying.   "But the Bank did strongly recommend a quarter percent rise this month," the minutes said. While George said that the recent rally in sterling would not be sufficient to offset stronger inflationary pressure emerging in 1998, Clarke said the currency's appreciation persuaded him that interest rates did not have to rise. "The Chancellor said he did not believe that enough account had been taken of the strength of the exchange rate," the minutes said. Clarke said he could see a case for raising interest rates taking the housing market and money supply figures in isolation. But other indicators were more mixed.   George said the government's 2.5 percent inflation target would be put increasingly at risk in the course of the next year despite the further strengthening of sterling and the lack of any immediate signs of inflationary pressure at the producer stage. He also noted broad money supply growth had risen further since the summer. "That was very unlikely to be compatable with the inflation target in the medium term". But Clarke said there were some signs domestic demand may have eased. "Although consumption was still strong, early indicators from the December CBI distributive trades survey and the British Retail Consortium suggested that the rate of growth may have eased off somewhat," the minutes quoted Clarke as saying. -- Kate Kelland +44 171 542 7715

ECAT	The Yugoslav economy risks collapse under the weight of internal commercial debt which is fast approaching the level of M1 money supply, economists warned on Wednesday. "Internal debts rose by 5.8 percent to reach 3.988 billion dinars ($819.3 million) at the end of July when M1 money supply stood at 4.34 billion dinars," said Tomislav Milisavljevic of the Belgrade-based Institute for Market Research (IZIT). According to the latest IZIT figures, there were 20,301 insolvent companies at the end of July -- 7.2 percent more than a month earlier. Most alarmingly, 93,5 percent of the total were permanently insolvent. Their overdue and unpaid liabilities stood at 3.809 billion dinars. Slobodan Milosavljevic also of the IZIT said the only possible cure was what he termed "multilateral compensation" in which all debts are cancelled. "This would annul all internal debts and companies and banks would have a clear way to start from scratch," Milosavljevic told Reuters. "After getting rid of such a huge burden, companies could turn to new business programmes, but generally it would be just a technical help," he added. According to Milosavljevic, the same situation happened in the former Yugoslavia at the end of 1970's, when a "general compensation" swept away all debts. Beside the crippling illiquidity, Serbian and Montenegrin companies face an even more serious problem after 3-1/2 years of U.N. economic sanctions -- an acute shortage of working capital. "Our economy would need at least $1 billion of foreign capital to begin to breathe," said Milosavljevic. "But it would only help if foreign funds are given strictly to economically viable programmes." But economists agreed the central bank should not secumb to the temptation to quietly expand money supply. "The central bank must stick to its advocated monetary aims and print new money only if backed by hard currency," an analyst said. Despite desperate state of internal debts, economists said it was unlikely any medicine would be offered to the crippled economy before the November 3 elections. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254
CCAT	Colombia's state oil company, Ecopetrol, said it exported 7.7 million barrels of crude oil and derivatives in October, providing the country with $174 million in export revenues. It said revenues were boosted by excellent market prices'' for the country's light-weight Cusiana and Cano Limon crudes, which sold at an average of $24.70 and $23.11 per barrel respectively throughout the month. No breakdown between crude oil and derivatives was given in Ecopetrol's monthly report on export revenues.   The company said September exports included 4.08 million barrles of crude oil, however, and 2.12 million barrels in other fuel products. The $174 million earnings figure for October compares to $91.9 million in September. -- Javier Mozzo, Bogota newsroom, 571 610 7944

Asked by reporters if there was room for further interest rate cuts, Fahey said: "That's a matter for the Reserve Bank, but what the budget does do, it increases national savings and that puts downward pressure on interest rates. It certianly gives a base for that to occur."

ECAT	Consultancy firm Access Economics said on Wednesday it believed the Reserve Bank (RBA) should not cut official interest rates again in the current cycle. "We agree inflation prospects are excellent, and that activity is currently quite soft," Access Economics said in its September quarter report. "Yet the outlook for the world economy continues to improve. "Linked to that substantial resource investment in Australia is providing a solid base to activity. Accordingly, if it were up to us, we would not cut Australian cash rates again in this cycle."   Access said the possibility of an interest rate cut remained quite high, although rate hikes were likely to follow in late calendar 1997. "We expect rate rises will be back on the agenda by late 1997," it said. Australian financial markets now widely expect the RBA to cut interest rates between late October and early November after it left rates unchanged on Wednesday. Interest rates were last changed on July 31, when they were cut by 0.5 percentage points to 7.00 percent. Access said it expected the economy to turn upwards in late 1997.   "Although short term activity will be weaker than Treasury has it, an upturn is coming," Access said. It said this would be powered by a recovery in the housing sector, robust resource investment, and good growth in both the United States and Japan. "With all these factors coming together, the long run of good news on Australian inflation may peter out in mid to late 1997," it said. The RBA has an underlying inflation target of an average of two to three percent over the course of 1996/97. The Australian government, in its August 20 budget, set a growth target of 3.5 percent for 1996/97. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273 2730
GCAT	Victory for Michael Schumacher and third place to Eddie Irvine in Sunday's rain-hit Monaco Grand Prix have ushered in a new era for Ferrari. For the first time since double world champion Schumacher joined the team after leaving Benetton in 1995, Ferrari took over the leadership of both the Formula One drivers' and constructors' championships. "This is a beautiful dream for the team," said Ferrari sporting director Jean Todt. "To have both cars on the podium, one first and one third, at Monaco...But I think we still have a long road ahead of us. "We must celebrate the result, enjoy the moment and then stop dreaming. Once this is over, we have to go testing in Barcelona and back to work." Despite Todt's caution after seeing his team end a 16-year drought without a Monaco win, it is clear that Ferrari pose a greater threat than at any time since Jody Scheckter of South Africa claimed their last drivers' title in 1979. Schumacher, the 28-year-old German who lifted the drivers' crown with Benetton in 1994 and 1995, demonstrated why on Sunday with a peerless drive through the rain to win easily by more than 53 seconds. He and his team mate Briton Eddie Irvine, who  has reeled off three successive podium finishes, have both praised new technical director Ross Brawn, formerly with Benetton, for the transformation in their fortunes. Briton Brawn joined the team last December, together with chief designer Rory Byrne, after working with Schumacher during his championship successes at Benetton. According to the German, he has brought a calm and methodical style of management to the team. "Ross likes to work in a logical way, with a programme, and he does not become emotional when he is in his work," said Schumacher. "This has been a welcome quality for the team." Schumacher, however, agreed with team chief Todt after Sunday's race when he said he did not think he or Ferrari were yet ready to challenge Williams for the world titles. Looking ahead to the Spanish Grand Prix at Barcelona in two weeks, he said: "To be honest, I would prefer to cancel Spain. It is not a circuit which suits our car. "But now that I have opened up a small gap in the championship, I suppose I can afford to just go for a finish in the points and it will still look good. "After Spain, though, I think we will be looking reasonably good for the rest of the season. There are some more improvements to come with the car and I am confident about the reliability." Despite Schumacher's pessimism, he won with Benetton in 1995 and with Ferrari in the wet last year. While Ferrari celebrated on Sunday night, the Williams team decamped from Monaco grim-faced after a disastrous error in weather-forecasting persuaded them to gamble on dry slick tyres and dry set-ups for the wet race. Both Jacques Villeneuve of Canada and Heinz-Harald Frentzen of Germany failed to finish and the team unexpectedly looked second best in all departments. "Our choice was based on a forecast of very fine drizzle for the first 20 or 30 minutes of the race," said team boss Frank Williams, who also pointed out that their forecaster had been accurate at all four previous races this year. "If it had worked this time, we would have been heroes," he added. "But it didn't."
CCAT	Bulgaria's energy minister said on Friday he was awaiting a technical and economic study carried out by Russian experts on the completion of the country's second nuclear power plant at Belene. "The Russian side informed us that in the middle of December they will give us a technical and economic study of the possibilities for the completion of the Belene unit and whether it is worthwhile," Roumen Ovcharov told parliament in reply to a deputy's question. Work on the construction of the Belene plant, 250 km (160 miles) north of Sofia, started in the 1980s but was halted six years ago due to a lack of cash and environmental protests. The foundations of the plant have been built and a 1,000-megawatt Soviet-designed reactor is on site. Some 40 percent of the unit's main equipment has been supplied to Belene and some 40 percent of the construction work has been completed. Some $1 billion has been invested there. Ovcharov said the study, funded by Russia, would clarify strategy and investment policy for the development of the energy system. He said the Russians would assess the condition of the supplied equipment and recommend technical measures for its conservation. Yuri Vishnevsky, president of Russia's atomic and radiation safety federal supervisory body, said during a visit to Sofia in October that Russia, in a consortium with Germany's Siemens AG and France's Framatome, was ready to participate in the eventual completion of the Belene unit. Bulgaria, which imports some 80 percent of its energy resources, relies on its Soviet-made nuclear plant at Kozloduy for more than 40 percent of the country's needs. -- Liliana Semerdjieva, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561
MCAT	Slovenia's blue-chip SBI index extended its record-breaking streak on Monday by rising 0.76 percent to close at a record high for the fourth session. Traders said the market was powered higher by insatiable demand for drug company Lek. The SBI index closed at 1,655.35 points, up 12.49 points -- and a hefty 40 percent since the beginning of the year. Lek, which has already surged over 140 percent since its listing five months ago, jumped another 1.82 percent to 34,200 tolars on volume of 5,234 shares. Lek was also the most actively traded share on the SBI with turnover of 5,234 lots. "Lek was pushed up by the good performance of its rival Krka, whose shares were listed on the OTC market today," one trader said. Krka closed at 26,010 tolars, well above the 7,043 tolars the bulk of shares were sold at during privatisation. Krka notched up staggering turnover of 26,485 shares on the over-the-counter market. "Lek and Krka are both expected to rise in the next couple of weeks due to expectations of good business results and large foreign and domestic demand," the trader added. Overall market turnover fell to 478.5 million tolars from 480.2 million, with six shares advancing, nine falling, one unchanged, and nine untraded. Trading company Kovinotehna was the biggest gainer, firming 4.13 percent to 580 tolars on volume of 1,926 shares. Brokerage Dadas led the day's decliners, falling 6.37 percent to 7,350 tolars on volume of 92 shares.
GCAT	Nasser Hussain, who stroked an unbeaten 101, and John Crawley offered England a glimpse of survival in the fourth Ashes test against Australia on Sunday. Coming together shortly before tea on the fourth day when England were 89 for four in the face of a first innings deficit of 329, they stayed to the close to lift their side to 212 for four -- 117 behind with one day left. "We've got a fighting chance," said the England coach David Lloyd. "The first hour's crucial and then the new ball will be crucial. We'll be scrapping like mad." Australia had built up their formidable lead by extending the overnight 373 for five to 501 for nine declared at lunch. Having been 50 for four at one stage on the second day, the recovery was led by opener Matthew Elliott, first with Ricky Ponting (127) and then supported by the lower order. Victorian left-hander Elliott scored an outstanding 199 before he was yorked by Darren Gough one run short of his first double-century in test cricket. He faced 351 deliveries and hit 23 fours and three sixes. "Matthew said he got a bit over-anxious trying to push the ball into a gap for a single," said Australian coach Geoff Marsh. Even the last-wicket pair of Paul Reiffel (54 not out) and Glenn McGrath (20 not out) came close to joining Elliott and Ponting in making their highest scores in test cricket. McGrath then snaffled England openers Mark Butcher and captain Michael Atherton cheaply, and Alec Stewart, confounded by a shooter from Reiffel, was bowled off the bottom of his bat for 16. That left Stewart with an average for the series of only 18, re-opening the debate about whether England should persist with a batsman-wicket-keeper. Graham Thorpe, dropped by Steve Waugh, soon edged another chance to wicketkeeper Ian Healy, who could not grasp it cleanly but saw Mark Waugh react smartly to grab the rebound at second slip. At 89 for four, it looked as if the match might not reach a fifth day, but Hussain and Crawley (48 not out) frustrated Australia with a blend of resolute defence and fluent strokes on a pitch of uneven bounce. "It'll be tough for England to hold out if we bowl the right line and length," said Marsh. "They had a good last session, but we're still pretty happy with the situation we're in. But it's a big day for the series tomorrow." The teams are level 1-1 in the six-test rubber.

MCAT	IPE gas oil futures ended steady and Brent crude oil staged a partial recovery after NYMEX crude and products recovered half, or all in the case of heating oil, of their opening losses, traders said. The January gas oil contract ended at $230.25 a tonne, up 75 cents, with the Jan/Feb backwardation at $4.25, up $1, as continued cold weather in Europe supported the front month contract. Opening one cent a gallon losses on NYMEX heating oil led by Tuesday's bearish U.S. stocks report were retraced as players covered shorts left by the early profit taking. Feb Brent dipped 15 cents on the NYMEX opening to trade 37 cents down at the day's low of $24.22 a barrel, but it too was recovering in late trade to stand 17 cents down at $24.42 cents a barrel as NYMEX crude and gasoline turned round early falls. Few people were convinced Brent's upside had been broken, but traders said any sign of warmer weather in Europe could prompt Brent to slip further, even though API data showed a 9.47 million barrel draw in U.S. crude oil stocks. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7456
GCAT	A vegetarian bus driver's civil rights were violated by a municipal bus company that fired him for refusing to hand out free hamburger coupons, a federal agency has ruled. "This is a wonderful day for me and vegetarians everywhere because we are being taken seriously," Bruce Anderson said in a statement on Friday. California's Orange County Transit Authority dismissed Anderson in June after he chose not to give passengers coupons from a fast-food chain that runs ads featuring sandwiches oozing sauce. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a written "determination" this week charging that the transit authority discriminated against the driver for "his strongly held moral and ethical beliefs," and violated his civil rights. Gloria Allred, his lawyer, said the Commission's ruling would add "considerable weight" to a civil lawsuit filed by Anderson. A Commission lawyer declined comment on the charges but said the agency encourages out-of-court settlements. "We would certainly be open to that," said Allred.
GCAT	The United States condemned on Thursday a Serbian crackdown on anti-government protesters and said it was continuing to hold President Slobodan Milosevic responsible for any resultant violence. "We repeat our call on the Serbian authorities to show restraint and to not interfere with the protesters' democractic rights," a State Department spokesman said. "We continue to hold Milosevic responsible for any violence which may occur."   In Belgrade, riot police forced opposition demonstrators off the streets on Thursday as the Serbian government cracked down on more than five weeks of protests against Milosevic. A spokeswoman for the Zajedno opposition parties said the coalition feared its three main leaders were about to be arrested. The State Department blasted the new restrictions on the anti-government protests as "an attempt to prevent the marchers from exercising their rights and can only serve to increase the possibility of confrontation and violence." "What we've seen is 36, 37 days of ... peaceful demonstrations," department spokesman John Dinger told reporters. "They only became violent through the provocative and irresponsible actions of the Serbian government" when it organized a counter-demontration on Tuesday.
CCAT	Netherlands-registered  Silk Road Gold Corp has stopped prospecting work on the Nikchesu goldfield in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan, an official from state gold concern Kyrgyzaltyn said on Monday. "Silk Road Gold spent a season doing exploration work on Nikchesu, looking for a large goldfield," Valentin Bogdetsky, a senior adviser with Kyrgyzaltyn, told Reuters in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek. "But having done some drilling, the company did not find what it had expected and considered further work pointless," Bogdestsky said, adding that Kyrgyzaltyn still thought the gold field held promise. Alexander Yarkov, in charge of Kyrgyzaltyn's joint venture activities, said that Nikchesu also contained antimony and complex ores. "To implement such projects, one needs a complex approach, while Silk Road Gold was interested only in the extraction of gold," Yarkov said. He declined to give estimates of Nikchesu's reserves but some experts put them at 158 tonnes of gold and 88,000 tonnes of antimony. Kyrgyz officials say Silk Road Gold is free to take part in other gold projects. Last year, Canada's Cameco Corp began extracting gold from Kyrgyzstan's largest goldfield, Kumtor, which has estimated reserves of 514 tonnes. Cameco, better known as a large uranium producer, has invested $452 million in Kumtor. It owns one third of the mine while Kyrgyzaltyn owns the remaining two thirds. --Almaty Newsroom +7 3272 509410

CCAT	PSA Peugeot Citroen chairman Jacques Calvet said on Wednesday that car orders had fallen since October, after the expiry at the end of September of a new-cars-for-old rebate scheme. He told a news conference he expect a strong drop in car registrations in the fourth quarter after the sharp fall in November "and no doubt in December," he said.   Car registrations fell 21.7 percent in November after rising 24.7 percent in October and rocketing 85.7 percent in September. Overall, he said he expected a 10 percent rise in car sales in France in 1996 but a nine to 10 percent drop in 1997. Calvet said the year-long two-tier rebate scheme accounted for between 225,000 and 250,000 registrations, benefitting the market around 25 percent more than a prior flat-rate scheme introduced by former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. He also said it skewed sales toward cheaper models but less than the prior scheme.   However, both schemes had the negative effects of creating sales peaks and troughs that made it harder to organise production and of distorting the notion of the price of a car in consumers' minds. price of a car. "The search for the best price has become the No. 1 criterion" for the car buyer, Calvet said. He said he expected a flat European market of around 12.7 million cars in 1997. He said his forecasts were based on the assumption that there would be no more government assistance programmes in France or elsewhere in Europe, such as Italy, where the possibility is being debated in the press. -- Paris Newsroom, +33 1 4221 5452
GCAT	Relatives of 13 Catholics shot dead by British troops in 1972 called for a fresh inquiry on Friday after reports that Britain covered up key facts of what became known as "Bloody Sunday". Britain's Channel 4 News said it had "exclusive proof that successive British governments covered up the full story of Bloody Sunday for a generation" and an Irish writer said new evidence pointed to previously undisclosed army gunfire. "I would like to see the case reopened, that is the first priority," said John Kelly, whose brother Michael was a victim of one of the British region's most controversial episodes when paratroopers opened fire at an Irish nationalist rally. An official inquiry headed by Lord Widgery, Lord Chief Justice, exonerated troops saying that they had come under fire. But Catholics opposed to British rule have always dismissed the findings. They say the casualties were unarmed victims of deliberating shootings on Sunday, January 30 1972. "Murder was committed that day in the name of the British government," Kelly, chairman of a families' Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign, told Reuters. He was speaking ahead of a report that Channel 4 News said was based on audio tapes of military radio messages "suppressed since the official inquiry", which refused to accept them as evidence because they had been illegally obtained. The programme will be aired on Friday night ahead of the 25th anniversary of Bloody Sunday and against a background of renewed violence by Catholic-backed Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas and threats that their Protestant "loyalist" foes will avenge it. "Recorded by a radio ham, the tapes prove that soldiers other than the Parachute Regiment were positioned along the old City Walls of Londonderry and indicate that these men fired and hit civilians," the television news organisation said. "Channel 4 News has obtained post mortem evidence which shows that at least three unarmed men were killed by bullets fired down through their bodies from above. "The City Walls are located high above the Bogside area where people were killed and are in direct line of sight to where the three men fell." A separate investigation by an Irish human rights activist, Don Mullan, who studied many of the original first-hand accounts, turned up a similar finding. He uncovered almost 50 statements from people who said soldiers were positioned on the walls and many were "very clear that firing was coming" from that vicinity, he told Reuters. Mullan, whose "Eyewitness Bloody Sunday" is published on Saturday, said: "Widgery confines himself to...the 108 rounds allegedly fired by paratroopers at ground level. He did not deal with the role of the British army on the walls." Three of victims had been hit from a 45 degree angle. Mullan said that from the statements and autopsy reports, an independent ballistic expert, Robert Breglio, who had spent 25 years with the New York City Police Department, had concluded that they were likely to have been "hit by a single marksman using a telescopic sight operating from a height". "I think that the case must be reopened because we have always known that these people wre murdered. We have raised enough suspicion... to warrant an investigation, especially into these three, and preferably into all 13 killed that day," Mullan said. -- Belfast Newsroom +01232-234099

ECAT	Having drawn rave reviews for telling us precisely when they reach decisions to shift short-term interest rates, Federal Reserve officials are now being urged to give us better clues on how they get there. Two goals stand out among economists' pleas for a more user-friendly Fed: a) choose a specific, measurable policy objective; and b) tone down the background noise needlessly obscuring the Fed's real agenda. "The Fed should say: This is what we are committed to do and do nothing else.   "Then the public would have no uncertainty as to what to expect from the Fed," said Anna Schwartz, research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. To date, the Fed has failed to clearly spell out exactly what its agenda is, analysts said.  Minutes of the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee meetings note the FOMC seeks "monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output." The deliberate vagueness of explanations like that has frustrated many Fed critics, who charge the central bank with obfuscation in an attempt to maintain its considerable power.   "The Fed does not have a specific objective and what it does is not even observable.  That's the best situation for a bureaucrat to be in -- the Fed has enormous power without any accountability," said Michael Belongia, a one-time St. Louis Fed economist now a professor at University of Mississippi. The Fed technically answers to Congress, where the Senate must approve appointments by the U.S. president to the board of governors. But legislators, as well as economists and journalists, have struggled for years to interpret the cryptic remarks of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, often with little success.   In a typical remark before a Congressional panel last July, Greenspan summed up the economy this way: "I think we are approaching some form of a fulcrum, where the economy can go in two significantly different ways." Or witness the contradictory headlines on July 8, 1995 after another Greenspan Congressional appearance. The New York Times reported "Greenspan Sees Chance Of Recession," even as the Wall Street Journal trumpeted "Fed Chairman Doesn't See Recession on the Horizon." Yet many analysts have praised Fed officials for attempting to explain their policy goals to outsiders.   New York Fed President William McDonough has recently advocated an official inflation target based on the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), a widely watched inflation barometer.  But that indicator has problems, including an apparent tendency to overstate actual inflation by one or two percentage points. Therefore, McDonough has suggested a target of somewhere between 0.5 percent and 2.0 percent would equate to the Fed's more nebulous goal of price stability. The Fed has cleared up ambiguity on rate decisions, added better information to FOMC minutes and begun releasing meeting transcripts on a five-year delay, analysts noted.   To give any more information to the public might subject Fed policy makers to undue political pressures, from which their current secret deliberations largely insulate them, Fed supporters say. "The Fed does deserve some credit.  Most people would like a little more information, but you can understand why Chairman Greenspan likes to hold his cards close to the table.  It gives him more flexibility. There is a tradeoff," said William Dudley, U.S. economic director at Goldman, Sachs & Co Inc. Still, some critics say five years is too long to wait for the verbatim texts of the FOMC meetings.   Former Fed Board Governor John LaWare told Reuters earlier this year he would support more timely release of the transcripts. "In my opinion, there would be no disadvantage to releasing (transcipts) six months after the (rate) decision. I have never been a believer that all this secrecy was necessary," said LaWare. The limelight-shy Fed on February 4, 1994 took a huge step toward the public eye with an unprecedented announcement that it had raised its target for the overnight federal funds rate.   In typical "Fed-speak," the central bank said it wanted to "increase slightly pressure on reserves," which Fed-watchers -- the Wall Street gurus who dissect every word of Fed jargon -- interpreted as a 25-basis-point fed funds rate increase. Since then, the Fed has announced all 10 of its interest rate actions, with nine of the 10 coming at scheduled FOMC meetings, allowing interested parties to prepare. By foreshadowing its moves on short-term rates, the Fed has helped lower long-term borrowing costs by reducing the danger of an unexpected policy shift, economists said.   But greater policy transparency could translate into even greater rewards, analysts said. Fed officials informally acknowledge they no longer target money supply data, which have been clouded by technological innovations that have altered the way Americans spend money. Now many critics want the Fed to update some other anachronisms, such as the discount rate -- the interest rate the Fed charges to banks for emergency overnight loans. Though considered largely symbolic, the discount rate still roils the markets.   For example, a September 17 Reuters story indicating eight of 12 regional Fed banks had requested a discount rate hike helped send the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond down nearly a full point, raising its yield to 7.03 percent from 6.95 percent. Despite those eight requests, the Fed has not yet raised the discount rate.  Still, analysts said the central bank should regularly disclose which banks want a higher rate to better prepare investors and consumers.  "If you're walking down a dark alley, wouldn't you like to see a sign that told you there was a mugger waiting for you?" said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co International Inc. But most analysts prefer not to push the Fed too far.  For example, recent proposals to videotape FOMC meetings drew little support.  "There is such a thing as too much transparency.  If you open up the meetings too much, it will push the true discussions underground," said Goldman's Dudley. "People don't want to make serious statements if they know their words are going to be out in the next two weeks," added Belongia. -- 212-859-1664
CCAT	A new cargo airline has been formed to dodge the air freight bottlenecks in Miami by utilising belly hold capacity in passenger planes taking tourists to Barbados, Cargo Link Caribbean Ltd commercial director Peter Brooks told Reuters. "Miami airport is traditionally fairly full at this time of year and we should be able to offer a very competitive service in terms of both speed and price," Brooks said. The first flight on the new link was operated northbound from Santiago on Thursday this week linking with two British Airways flights returning to London Gatwick and carried 37 tonnes of freight. Recently cargo, especially from Europe, has waited for upto a week in Miami awaiting transhipment to Latin America. Cargo Link plans take advantage of spare Caribbean belly capacity for freight moving between Latin America and Europe, Canada or the U.S.. "Our rates will be competitive with both direct flights to Latin America as well as those that currently go via Miami," he added. "We won't have a surcharge, but we can't control what surcharges may be imposed by the airlines whose belly capacity we will be utilising," Brooks said. Cargo Link, which is registered in Barbados, has wet leased a DC-8-54F with a payload of 43 tonnes which will fly between Bridgetown and Latin American airports. Initially, the service will comprise separate flights to Santiago and Guatemala and a linked one to Quito and Lima. If the concept proves successful more destinations and planes could be added, Brooks said. The first flight northbound from Santiago to Bridgetown took place Thursday, November 21 and the first to Quito and Lima will be on Friday, November 29. The first flight to Guatemala is scheduled for Monday, December 2. Apart from Bvritish Airways Cargo Link is in discussion with American Airlines, Air Canada and LTU of Dusseldorf to use spare capacity in their flights carrying tourists to and from the Caribbean. Brooks said he is keen to talk to all airlines flying top Bridgetown. Cargo Link will subcontract ground handling to a local agent agent at Bridgetown where the small size of the airport means transhipment times can be little as two hours, Brooks said. The heavy volume of passenger flights with spare freight capacity means that in most cases the overall volume handled by Cargo Link will be determined by the capacity of its wet lease. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
ECAT	California state Treasurer Matt Fong said on Monday he sold $162 million in state public works board refunding revenue bonds. The $162 million sale, completed on Friday, was the third refunding sale in as many weeks, producing combined savings to taxpayers of more than $31 million. "In all three recent refundings, our preparation and continued monitoring of the market allowed us to take advantage of falling interest rates to generate millions of dollars in savings for California taxpayers," Fong said. The $162 million issue included the sale of $40 million in 1996 Series D California Community College refunding bonds. All three refundings were scheduled for sale on September 4 but were postponed due to market conditions, Fong said.
MCAT	South African three-month deposit rates fell to their lowest levels in almost three months on Thursday as the money market shortage continued to defy month-end pressures. Easier rates have sparked talk of an early interest rate cut. Many money market traders believe this is may be premature, but some say the more stable conditions could pave the way for further moves to ease foreign exchnage controls. Three-month NCD rates were quoted at between 16.90 and 16.95 percent offered -- their lowest level since November 9 -- from 17.05 percent on Wednesday, while the Reserve Bank said the money market shortage eased to 8.49 billion rand on Wednesday from 8.937 billion rand on Tuesday. The fall in the shortage came despite another rise in notes and coins in circulation to 19.948 billion rand from 19.422 billion rand previously. The Reserve Bank has put the lower shortage down to commercial banks selling dollars bank to the central bank. While money market traders agree that these flows are helping, they also cite foreign gilt purchases and an inflow of proceeds from recent Eurorand issues as contributing factors. Chris Doyle, assistant general manager at UAL Merchant Bank Treasury, said the lower shortage was the prime mover behind the fall in short-term rates. "Primarily it is what you are seeing in the shortage," Doyle said. "If you look at the forwards, they are saying it is attractive for foreigners to bring money into the country instead of the local banks to place their dollars offshore. So we are starting to see a reversal of flows," he said. Forward rates continue to fall in line with the easing of money market liquidity pressures. Three-month forward rates are at their lowest levels since mid-October, as are one-year forwards. Traders say that as forward rates play catch-up with the money market, that market is beginning to discount a rate cut. Some money market players feel, however, that such talk is premature. "The market is merely returning to a more stable situation," one trader said. "With call rates still at around 17 percent, it is going to be a while before a Bank rate cut." Bank rate, which was last hiked by one percentage point on November 21 last year, currently stands at 17 percent. Doyle said the return of stability to the markets could herald an easing of exchange controls, rather than lead to a cut in interest rates. "Once we start getting the stability again and our rates are still fairly attractive, that is the time for them to do something on exchange controls," he said. "One of the main problems of doing away with exchange controls is that we get flows out of the country and one way of negating that is if our rates are still fairly attractive. "From that point of view I don't think they are going to start cutting rates yet," Doyle said. -- Johannesburg newsroom, +27 11 482-1003

CCAT	Rent-Way Inc said Friday it had signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire 70 rental-purchase stores for $23 million.   The company, which did not give further details of the purchase, said the stores were located in Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia and owned by the Rental-King chain. Annual revenues for 62 of the 70 stores total about $24 million, it said. "With the completion of this acquisition, Rent-Way will (have) ...193 stores and revenues at a twelve month running rate approaching $100 million," it said. The deal is set to close in early February, it added. Rent-Way said the deal was its second acquisition in 1997. Assuming completion of the acquisition, the company will have grown from just 19 stores with annual revenues of $8 million when it had its public offering in 1993, to 193 stores with monthly revenues of about $8 million, it said. Rent-Way currently operates a chain of 123 rental-purchase stores, renting brand name durable household products such as furniture and major appliances.
GCAT	By negotiating a landmark NATO-Russia pact, alliance Secretary-General Javier Solana has secured himself a place in the history of an organisation whose very existence he once opposed. "He played a decisive role. He kept the allies together," one NATO ambassador said after news of the breakthrough with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov reached Brussels. Solana, 54, was mandated last December to try to negotiate the deal with Russia to establish a central plank of a new European security order and overcome Moscow's fears over NATO's planned eastwards enlargement. Before a furious Russian propaganda onslaught, he kept his nerve -- making clear NATO wanted a deal with Moscow, but enlargement would take place anyway. Through six rounds of hard negotiating, Solana maintained alliance solidarity and rejected Russian pressure for limits on the freedom of action act of likely new members, such as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. "There is no doubt, this is a personal triumph. It is good for Solana, good for NATO, good for the Russians and good for the new members," said one alliance source. Solana, a former Spanish foreign minister with a track record as a tough negotiator, was up against a formidable adversary in Primakov -- an ex-Kremlin spy-master and hardened veteran of arms control talks with the West. "He had to make Russia understand it stood to gain more by signing than not signing," added the source. The deal with Russia caps a frantic period for Solana who took over as the NATO head in December 1995 after Belgium's Willy Claes was forced to resign in a local bribery scandal. The appointment brought much prestige to Spain, a country not fully integrated into all of NATO's military structures, and was seen as a sign of how the alliance was transforming itself from Cold War military machine to a European-wide security body. Solana immediately won plaudits for his skilful handling of the weekly meetings of NATO's 16 ambassadors -- the alliance's policy-making forum -- and negotiations with Bosnian Serb leaders over the implementation of the Dayton peace accords. His relaxed, warm personal style -- in sharp contrast to Claes' bad-tempered outbursts -- pleased both staff and visitors while hard work and professionalism won over more admirers. Solana, a married man with two children, travelled widely both to NATO members and non-members using to good effect all the contacts he had made while president of the European Union's Council of Ministers. He frequently visited former Yugoslavia where NATO troops police the Dayton peace accords which ended the 3-1/2 year Bosnian war and became the first NATO head to visit Moscow for almost five years. Insiders say the personal rapport he established with NATO's leaders saw him entrusted with the task of negotiating the deal with Primakov. Previous major East-West accords have usually seen key NATO capitals taking the lead in the negotiations. A physicist by education, Solana had as a young socialist militant opposed Spain's NATO membership. Staff say Solana -- a keen sportsmen -- likes to joke his punishing work routine reflects a northern European approach in the morning when he starts work early and a southern European approach in the evening when he finishes late.

ECAT	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned Slovakia its economy was in danger of overheating and urged the introduction of stricter financial policies to curb domestic consumption. In a report made public on Wednesday, the IMF said signs of an overheating economy could be seen in the significant deterioration of the current account which ran a $1.5 billion deficit in 1996 after a $648.8 million surplus in 1995. "After three years of fast economic growth and decreasing inflation the Slovak economy shows signs of overheating," the report, resulting from an IMF mission to Slovakia in October, said. "A further signal of overheating is the fast growth of real wages which increased by 12 percent over the past 12 months and to a high degree surpassed the growth of productivity," it added. The report said that over 20 percent growth in domestic consumption also contributed to the worsening of the current account, which in 1996 was some 10 percentage points of GDP higher than in the previous year. "Such a level of the current account deficit is untenable as, with regard to the low level of direct foreign investment, would lead to high growth of foreign debt," the IMF said. The report said that for this reason, the IMF recommends a "stricter financial policy aimed at reducing domestic consumption". It said the key to Slovakia's economic policy was to find the optimum method of a return to a sustainable development of the current account. "Apart from tightening financial policy, the worsening of export competitiveness, a result of the fast growth of real wages in the past two years, must also be stopped," it said. The report said the IMF projected Slovakia's 1997 GDP growth at five percent with an average inflation of five percent. At the end of 1996, inflation stood at 5.4 percent, while GDP growth of 6.8-7.0 percent is expected. "It is assumed that under present conditions the fiscal deficit will increase to some 19 billion crowns ($580 million), which is 2.9 percent of the GDP, with the state budget deficit at around five billion crowns and the deficit of non-budgetary projects should total 16 billion crowns," the report said.

ECAT	German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said on Monday that Germany should see growth of 2.5 percent this year and between 2.5 and 2.75 percent in 1998. Asked whether the government forecast of 2.5 percent for this year was realistic, Rexrodt said: "I believe there is a very realistic chance (of achieving this). This is not an optimistic estimate." "Next year will be rather more favourable and growth will be between 2.5 and 2.75 percent," Rexrodt told reporters in Bonn.

GCAT	Republican challenger Bob Dole went into Wednesday's final election debate with President Bill Clinton accusing his administration of not taking charges of ethical misconduct seriously. Dole, who is far behind in the polls less than three weeks before the Nov. 5 election, appeared relaxed and ready for a tough debate with Clinton after a tour of the Shiley Theatre at the University of San Diego where the 90-minute showdown will take place at 9 P.M. EDT (0100 GMT). "They don't take it seriously. That's the trouble with this White House," Dole said when asked about Clinton not responding to his charges on ethical controversies. "They don't take any of this seriously. That's the problem," he told reporters, adding that by not responding directly "he (Clinton) underscored the problem." Asked if he worried that criticism of Clinton might backfire, Dole shook his head. He said he would "talk about the future, people's problems, how we're going to solve them, how we're going to address the problems -- it will be over before you know it." The Republican candidate played down speculation that the debate was a "do or die" situation for his presidential bid where he must win strongly to catch up with Clinton. "No, I don't think so," he said. "We're moving ahead. The race is tightening up. I feel good about it. Happy to have the debate -- we'd like to have more but they would only agree to two -- I guess this will be the last one." Asked what he had to do in the town-meeting part of the debate, Dole said he would have to "talk a lot about our economic plan and we'll talk about some of the things the president promised and didn't deliver and some of the things he didn't promise and did deliver." Dole aides, seeking to lower expectations, said Clinton was going into the debate "a prohibitive favourite." The debate is vital for Dole, who still lags behind his Democratic rival by double digits in public opinion polls. Dole on Tuesday gave what could be a preview of his strategy in the face-off, telling a business audience: "No administration has been more self-righteous. But few administrations have been more self-serving. No administration has shown more arrogance. But few have displayed more ethical failures." Clinton, who rehearsed for the debates in New Mexico, dismissed Dole's tongue-lashing as just politics, but Clinton campaign press secretary Joe Lockhart said Dole's remarks showed "the attack dog has been unleashed," referring to criticism of Dole in earlier campaigns as meanspirited. In his speech on Tuesday, Dole counted off a series problems that have faced the Democratic White House including "more than 30 Clinton officials investigated, fired, or forced to resign due to ethical improprieties." Dole has rarely made direct reference to the Whitewater investigation of a land deal Clinton and his wife, Hillary, invested in when they lived in Arkansas. But on Tuesday he again demanded that Clinton "should clearly promise there will be no (presidential) pardons in legal cases that personally concern him," alluding to Clinton's convicted Whitewater partners, Susan and James McDougal. Former Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said in morning television talk shows on Wednesday that Dole's call for no pardons was "hypocrisy." Walsh, who during the Reagan administration investigated the secret arms sales to Iran to finance arms for Nicaragua "Contra" rebels, said Dole was "the foremost advocate" of a pardon for former Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger. Walsh, who has been writing a book, "Firewall: The Iran- Contra Conspiracy and Cover-up," said in a statement that Dole lobbied then- President George Bush to pardon Weinberger ahead of his trial on charges related to the affair. Bush did pardon Weinberger. "Senator Dole's demand that President Clinton forego future pardons connected with Whitewater gives the voters a remarkable view of Dole's hypocrisy ...." Walsh said.
CCAT	BankAmerica Corp said it is nearing some conclusions in its ongoing study of its businesses to determine which are producing adequate returns. "We are looking at all businesses and we're reaching some conclusions and are making some decisions," said chief financial officer Mike O'Neill on a conference call following the release of its third quarter results. He said the bank's recent decision to sell 68 rural branches in Texas and other recent asset sales reflected this ongoing process.   BankAmerica earlier reported third quarter net of $1.75 a share versus $1.72 a share, including a one-time assessment of $82 million for Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) recapitalization. The First Call mean estimate for the quarter was $1.83 a share. Some analysts said that the company came in line, if the SAIF assessment is excluded. But others said the earnings were slightly below expectations, because the SAIF assessment was offset by certain non-recurring gains.
CCAT	Holding company Clal Israel Ltd on Tuesday  reported a sharp decline in net profit to 22.7 million shekels on revenues of 1.311 billion from 66.9 million shekels on revenues of 1.455 billion in the same 1996 quarter. Clal, whose interests cover electronics, property, insurance and trading, said the sharp decline in earnings was partly due to losses in its electronics and telecommunications businesses and to a slowing domestic economy. Clal's Scitex Corp posted a loss for the period while its new Baraq affiliate ran up heavy costs as it prepared to offer international phone service in Israel later this year. Clal also cited one-time charges totalling about 20 million shekels, most of it connected with its loss-making Clal Trading Ltd subsidiary. Clal said that discounting one-time charges, net would have been 43 million shekels for the quarter, versus about 38 million shekels a year earlier. Clal said first-quarter net left it with a return on equity of 3.4 percent, compared with 10 percent a year earlier and 4.3 percent for all of 1996. Among its principal businesses, only its Clal Insurance Holdings subsidiary showed appreciable improvement. Attributable profits from insurance rose to 22.8 million shekels in the quarter from 19.4 million shekels a year ago. Attributable profits from industrial operations fell to 20.9 million shekels from 47.8 million shekels a year earlier, while those for property development were flat at 12.3 million shekels.

MCAT	CSCE coffee advanced Tuesday on the heels of stock data showing certified coffee inventories at their lowest level in more than a decade, dealers said, but the rally fell short of key resistance targets. Prices rose from the outset, fueled by a steep, 10,000-bag drop in exchange-deliverable coffee. The drawdown, which caught many traders by surprise, reduced CSCE certified stocks to a 12-year low of 31,669 bags as of September 27. But the early rally failed to catch fire, and selling by producer countries reappeared toward the highs, dealers said. Benchmarket December futures rose 1.80 cent per lb, to 104.75, after trading from 103.50 to 105.60. Today's decidedly measured run-up points to what analysts said is coffee's limited upside potential over the long-term. With stocks in consumer countries expected to build steadily in the coming months as Latin American producers harvest their 1996/97 crop, buyers will likely become increasingly cautious, said Smith Barney analyst Walter Spilka. "Coffee prices are not going to go up much more because the coffee harvest is coming," said Smith Barney analyst Walter Spilka. "Pretty soon, we will be knee-deep in coffee."   The nearby December contract benefitted most from the stock draw, padding its premium to second-position March by 0.70 cent. Traders said the switch could widen out to as much as 6.00 cents as coffee roasters seek to secure near-term supplies. Technically, 107.25 remained a key resistance objective, with downside targets noted at yesterday's low of 102.25 and then at 100.00 cents. Turnover on the exchange was estimated at 7,906 lots. -- Wendy Pollack, New York Commodities Desk +1 212 859 1640

ECAT	British trade figures due on Wednesday will probably show the trade deficit with the rest of the world widened in December, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Their consensus estimate was for a December trade gap of 1.014 billion stg after a November shortfall of 959 million. The December global trade data will be released on Wednesday at 0930 GMT at the same time as January figures for trade with non-European Union countries. January trade with EU nations will be included in the January global figures due in March. Economists said last month's figures showed a surprise fall in exports. They will watch keenly to see if that phenomenon has continued. "While we do expect sterling's rise to depress export growth, this will take some time to work through," said Ciaran Barr, UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "Accordingly, we expect a modest rebound in non-EU export levels in this month's data." The Reuter poll has an estimate of 793 million stg for Britain's non-EU trade deficit in January, down from 844 million in December. The pound has risen about 16 percent on a trade-weighted basis since last August. A rising currency classically produces a "J curve" effect and this time is no exception. As a currency appreciates it cuts import prices and raises export prices. With trade volumes slow to react to price changes, the trade gap will narrow, in value terms, in the short-run -- the so-called J curve. But as price changes shift the dynamics of supply and demand, the strong pound will eventually force a deterioration of Britain's trade position as export markets shy away from the higher prices imposed by the pound. The reverse, of course, applies to imports which look ever cheaper to the now confident British consumer. "Once the beneficial impact of sterling upon export and import prices has washed through the system we anticipate a marked widening in the deficit as the loss of competitiveness feeds through into volumes," said David Philpotts, UK economist at Schroders. Barr agreed that the underlying trend in 1997 will be for higher trade deficits. For Britain's global trade gap, Philpotts said the fall in import prices was already being more than offset by an acceleration in import volumes. He noted that the non-EU trade deficit widened by 145 million pounds to 844 million in December and forecast a global trade deficit of 1.2 billion stg this time. Philpotts said evidence from the Confederation of British Industry suggested export volumes improved slightly in the New Year. The CBI's monthly industrial trends survey showed the balance of manufacturers reporting falling exports in December was minus 15 percent -- i.e. 15 percent more firms said exports fell than said they rose. That figure fell to minus eight percent in the January survey but widened back out to minus 12 in February. "With import penetration rising strongly, we are sceptical whether there will be any improvement in the non-EU trade deficit in January," Philpotts said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109
MCAT	The dollar closed moderately weaker against the yen on Monday after two senior Japanese politicians suggested interest rates in Japan might soon head higher, currency experts said. The Bank of Japan's (BOJ) official discount rate has been at a record low of 0.5 percent since September 1995. The remarks fueled demand for yen in Asia, which carried over when trade got underway in Europe and New York. "They're buying yen and selling everything that's been bought the last couple of weeks," said Ben Strauss, an assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer and Co.   The dollar closed at 111.09/16 yen and 1.5304/11 marks, down from 111.40/45 yen and 1.5311/14 marks at the open. Shizuka Kamei, head of the Liberal Democratic Party press office, was quoted in news reports as saying on Monday that a rise in Japan's official discount rate will probably be considered after general elections. Elections are set for October 20. Separately, Ichiro Ozawa, head of the main opposition New Frontier Party or Shinshinto, also said on Monday that Japan's interest rate levels must be corrected. The BOJ declined to comment.   Although the politicians' comments jolted a foreign exchange market sensitive to signs that rates in Japan will climb, some analysts dismissed the comments as a ploy to please Japanese savers dissatisfied with the country's rock-bottom interest rates. "I view it mainly as political posturing ahead of the election," said Brian McCarthy, a market analyst at Ruesch International. "I don't think either party is serious about raising rates without economic justification for it," he added.   Growing optimism that the European Union will successfully launch a common currency as planned in January 1999 continued to pressure the mark relative to some other European currencies, currency experts said. The European Union's monetary committee meets on Tuesday to move forward on key factors including a budget stability pact for countries joining the single currency. "I think that there's no question the overall consensus of the market is that EMU (European Monetary Union) will go ahead and will go ahead on schedule," said William Marr, manager of foreign exchange at Credit Commerciale De France.   "It's just a question now of a little bit of jockeying in terms of what the market consensus is on who are going to be the first members," Marr said. The mark traded around 989.75/0.25 Italian lira and 3.3784/87 French francs in late dealings, down from 990.75/1.00 lira and 3.3817/22 francs earlier in the session. Expectations that Italy will soon re-enter the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) also bolstered the lira. "The market is reluctant to sell off lira with the possibility the French and Germans will insist on lira appreciation before ERM entry," Ruesch's McCarthy said.   The lira crashed out of the ERM during a currency crisis in September 1992. Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi requested last week that talks start quickly on the level at which the lira might re-enter the system. Elsewhere, the dollar closed at 1.2541/46 Swiss francs, off from 1.2562/72 at the open. The dollar ended little changed at Canadian $1.3530/35 compared with C$1.3531/36. The pound inched up to $1.5633/40 from $1.5628/35 and the Australian dollar rose to $0.7873/78 from $0.7861/66. -- Donna Sells 212 859 1668
MCAT	Rotterdam bunker prices were slightly softer on Monday on modest demand of 15,000 tonnes, brokers said. Rotterdam 380 cst bunker fuel was at $87/89 a tonne against $89/91 on Friday, with 180 cst steady at $94/96. "Demand is quite low but supply is sufficient," one broker said. Antwerp bunkers were at similar levels, with diesel at $157/162 and gas oil at $169/173, about $1 higher than in Rotterdam. "Demand was very poor this morning but it was reasonable in the afternoon," another broker said. High sulphur barge prices continued the slide begun on Friday, falling to $86.50 in Rotterdam, on low demand and plenty of oil, traders said. Demand in Fos was brisk, with 380 cst rising to $90 from $84 and 180 cst at $96 from $89, but Augusta and Piraeus were quiet. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 4088
MCAT	Small-capitalised stocks denominated in U.S. dollars dominated activity on the Singapore stock market on Friday as the local currency slipped to new 30-month lows, dealers said. "Currency ruled. You can see the top volumes are generated by U.S. dollar-denominated stocks and small-capitalised stocks, some of which are laggards," said a dealer with a local house. On Friday, the Singapore dollar fell below 1.4665 to the U.S. currency as funds continued to buy the U.S. dollar. Currency dealers also said the local currency was adjusting to recent weakness in other regional currencies. U.S. dollar-listed CM Telecom, Roly, Thakral and Huan Hsin were among the actives which hit new highs.

GCAT	Boris Becker's comeback shuddered to a halt amid the wind and rain at the German Open on Thursday, beaten 7-6 6-2 by Spain's Felix Mantilla, while the top-seeded Thomas Muster was blown away 6-1 6-2 by a storm of brilliance from a 23-year-old Moroccan Hicham Arazi. Six seeds failed to reach their places in the quarter-finals in a tournament which has provided ingloriously rapid dismissals for some other famous names. Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, seeded three,  lost 6-1 6-1 to Andrei Medvedev and Wayne Ferreira, the sixth seed, went down 6-1 6-3 to Sergei Bruguera of Spain. At least Becker had his moments. The three-times Wimbledon champion held a point to win the first set before going out 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 to the patiently rallying Mantilla, one of three Spaniards to make the quarter-finals. The German might have done still better had not rain delayed the match for almost an hour with the score at 6-6 in the tie-break. At that stage Becker was creating some attacking momentum in slippery, gusty conditions which hindered a serve-volleyer most of all. On the resumption, Becker twice approached the net a little ambitiously and saw two fluent backhands from Mantilla go past him. First set captured, the Spaniard gained in confidence, and Mantilla's superior ground strokes increasingly assumed control of the contest. Becker, who the day before had achieved his first win for 11 weeks in only his second tournament since aggravating a wrist injury, was left to contemplate what might have been. "The match was a bit different after the break," he said. Mantilla next plays Arazi, who can rarely have played better than while ousting clay court king Muster on his favourite surface. Arazi covered the court with great speed and intelligently mixed teasing backhand slices with bouts of brilliant hitting. He also launched fierce ambushes with sudden changes of pace on his serve and several times saw his shots skid off the line-tapes on important points. "I played without thinking," he said. "I couldn't understand what was happening. It was a very good day though I was a bit lucky, and at the end of the match I was always touching the lines." Krajicek departed with hardly a whimper.  The world number five seemed quite unable to adapt to the conditions and delayed the progress of Medvedev, who had won both their previous contests on slow surfaces, little more than 50 minutes. The eighth-ranked Chilean Marcelo Rios, trying to make his way back after a thigh injury, also looked well below par as he went out 6-4 6-1 to Spain's Alberto Berasategui.

CCAT	Pocket Communications Inc., a wireless personal communications services (PCS) operator, said it voluntarily sought bankruptcy protection Monday after defaulting on $80 million in loans. Privately held Pocket had bid $1.4 billion in the auctions for entrepreurial operators held by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission last November for for its licenses and has paid the FCC more than $140 million. The company had one license covering 35 million potential U.S. customers in markets such as Chicago, Detroit, Dallas-Ft. Worth, St. Louis, New Orleans, Las Vegas and Honolulu.   Pocket officials said they filed for court protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division. In a phone interview, Dan Riker, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the company voluntarily chose to file for bankruptcy to protect its assets against a group of creditors to which it had defaulted on $80 million in loans. The creditors include a group of Asian entrepreneurs and telecom equipment makers Siemens AG and Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, the executive said.   Pocket was one of several top bidders in last year's PCS auctions that have buckled under the strain of interest payments required by the FCC to pay for the PCS licenses. Pocket, NextWave Telecom Inc., which bid $4.7 billion, and several other winners had asked regulators for a more lenient timetable in which to repay the bids, which have become loans from the government on which the bidders pay interest. The companies had asked for an annual repayment schedule instead of a quarterly one. Pocket said it filed for bankruptcy to satisfy short-term financing requirements and to initiate a restructuring plan.   Pocket had previously secured commitments for more than $646 million in financing to build out its PCS networks from equipment vendors including Ericsson, Siemens' Stromberg-Carlson unit and Northern Telecom Ltd. It said it had completed deals with Ericsson and Northern Telecom for $481 million of that financing. However, Riker said Pocket's financing plans had hinged on an initial public offering planned for last fall, which had to be postponed due to delays in the FCC auction process. A second shot at an IPO in January fell apart when Wall Street soured on initial offerings in the wireless sector.   Analysts forecast a shakeout in the industry as a host of new players engage in a city-by-city battle for market share with established cellular incumbents typically owned by cash-heavy regional Bell companies and long-distance carriers. Riker said the company views the filing as a temporary measure to ensure its long-term viability. He forecast that the reorganization process would take several months before it can emerge from Chapter 11 on firm financial footing. Referring to the bankruptcy protection, he said that, "If there was no waiver, the creditors would have had a right to seize the collateral," or PCS licenses it holds.   Pocket said it has about $1 billion in assets -- largely the value of its wireless liceneses -- and about $1.5 billion in liabilities -- largely the long-term debt owed to the FCC. The company has begun construction of PCS networks in its Las Vegas and Honolulu markets and has switching equipment and local management in place there. Riker said Pocket's financial troubles would delay the launch of its services. "We think (autumn) is probably the time frame," he told Reuters. The company said it had applied to the Bankruptcy Court for authority to hire the law firm of Whiteford, Taylor & Preston as its bankruptcy counsel, and Perkins Coie as general corporate counsel. Pocket is based in Washington. Brightpoint Inc, an Indianopolis-based provider of retail packaging and fulfillment services for many cellular phone providers, has invested $5 million in Pocket. Riker started Pocket in 1993 after 12 years with MCI Communications Corp, where his jobs included heading the company's cellular business before it was sold to McCaw Cellular.
GCAT	India's Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party said on Friday that the United Front had not yet resolved its problem on the admittance of the breakaway Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) group of Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's Janata Dal. DMK president Muthuvel Karunanidhi told reporters in Madras that the alliance's Steering Committee will discuss the issue on July 25, when he expected the problem to be resolved.   Information and Broadcasting Minister Jaipal Reddy said after a meeting of senior alliance leaders on Thursday that the United Front had decided not to admit the RJD, whose leader Laloo Prasad Yadav has been indicted in a corruption scandal. Yadav says he is innocent in the $280 million scandal, but has faced pressure from communists in the coalition to resign as chief minister of his state, Bihar. "No decision on RJD's admission was taken at yesterday's meeting. Only by rushing to the press with such hasty statements, unnecessary confusion is being caused," Karunanidhi, who is also Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu state, said. The DMK president said he had argued for RJD's presence in the coalition during Thursday's meeting and had received support from other alliance leaders. "It was only decided that all issues would be sorted out on July 25 when the United Front Steering Committee will meet after swearing in of the President," he said. "I hope that a satisfactory solution would be found." The DMK threatened to pull out of Gujral's government on Monday, citing differences with coalition partners on how to deal with the RJD, which was formed on July 5 following differences in the Janata Dal over leadership elections. "My statement on Monday was aimed at averting a mid-term election," Karunanidhi said. --New Delhi newsroom,+91-11-301 2024

GCAT	Tropical cyclone 27s is tracking towards the northwest coast of Australia. The system continues to impact shipping with top winds of 50 mph. This system will threaten Barrow Island and the coastline between Onslow and the North West Cape during the next 24-48 hours. Top winds could be near 55-60 mph at that time. Rough seas and winds will cause some damage through coastal property during this period. The oil rigs in the region will also be affected by this system.   Tropical cyclone Karlette continues as mostly a risk to shipping in the southwest Indian Ocean during the next 36-48 hours. Top winds are now 60 mph but they may increase to 75 mph during the next 48 hours. Karlette is heading towards the island of Mauritius. It is expected to approach this island in about 72 hours. The island can expect to see increasing wind and seas later this period. Tropical cyclone Harold is weakening and becoming less of a threat to shipping in the Coral Sea, southwest of New Caledonia. This system should be extratropical by 12 hours.   Storms continue to be very strong in the northeastern Atlantic, spreading areas of strong westerly winds across northwestern Europe. The latest in a series of storms will bring powerful westerly winds through the region today-Friday, with gusts to 50 mph likely. Problems will continue for shipping operations. Local property damage is also possible.
GCAT	Venetians broadly turned their backs on Umberto Bossi's bid to split Italy on Sunday, concentrating on the far more profitable business of catering to the tourists. Arrigo Cipriani, whose world-renowned Harry's Bar was serving up its usual Sunday lunches to the well-heeled, slammed the separatist leader as a madman. "Unfortunately Mr Bossi's place should be in the mad house," the besuited restaurateur said over a drink at the bar. "The lunatic asylums are full of Napoleons and the like and he is part of the family. That said, he's also a snob. He has shown that by choosing Venice for its image." He added: "Venice has an image but of its own. Not for others". Over in St Mark's Square, where hordes of tourists queued to get into the Basilica and tiptoed across the water-logged square, birdseed seller Sebastian Ohs was no happier. "Personally, I think Bossi is a pain in the neck. We're trying to work here," he said sitting in front of his neatly arranged bags full of maize. "The tourists are still here but a lot of those who usually come on a Sunday have been scared away because of the crowds." A large Italian flag hung in the square between two flags depicting the golden-winged lion of Venice on a red background. Valdo Tomatilli, a Socialist councillor from a nearby town, was in the square draped in the Italian flag as a protest against Bossi. "This is to show that millions of people don't think like Bossi," he said, watched by bemused tourists. "At the beginning, Bossi was a good person but he has changed," Tomatilli said. Flag-waving militants from all over northern Italy thronged the lagoon front in bright sunshine from St Mark's Square to the Piazza Dei Sette Martiri where Bossi was due to declare "independence" for his "Federal Republic of Padania". Gondolier Roberto Vianello was watching the crowd go by. "It has created a few problems for work today," he said. "But when something like the Pink Floyd concert happened a few years ago, it created more problems." Directly opposite the grandstand erected for Bossi's declaration, an Italian flag fluttered from a window of a building inhabited mostly by the poor and elderly. On the tiled roof of the building, three shirts -- green, white and red as the Italian flag -- were strategically hung out to dry on a washing line. The flags infuriated green-shirted League officials and the mass of flag-waving faithful but they remained firmly in place. Bossi's visit to Venice is the culmination of three days travelling along the Po river in a semi-mystical prelude to founding his new "northern state". Another man carried a placard declaring "Christ is also with the people of Padania". League officials, meanwhile, handed out pamphlets to inform tourists about what was going on. John Jones, an engineer from the east side of Manhattan, was not over-excited by it all despite the discreet presence of riot police stationed nearby and in the back alleys. "It's pretty mild compared to what I've seen in New York," he said. "I've never understood Italian politics, through all their governments and through all the years," said Jones, who comes to Italy on holidays every two years. "Looking around at the people, I think it's just an excuse to have some fun."

MCAT	Growth in demand for chocolate products in eastern Europe should secure future markets for Germany's cocoa trade, the VRBF trade organisation said. Germany's high per-capita chocolate consumption and expanding markets in eastern Europe guarantee favourable future business prospects, it said in its annual report. In 1996, Germany processed 17 percent of global cocoa crops. In a statement last Friday export promoters "German Sweets" showed central and eastern European countries accounted for 200,000 tonnes of total exports of 306,000 tonnes in 1996 (263,000 tonnes in 1995). But VRBF, which represents 34 importers, exporters and brokers, said while implied raw materials consumption was rising in Germany a change in trade flows meant relatively more beans and semis were processed in western Europe and at origin. The trade was confident it could change itrs role towards becoming a provider of increasingly sophisticated ingredients for confectionery manufacture. Of 294,099 tonnes of beans imported in 1996 (up 3.4 percent from 1995), 60.1 percent came from Ivory Coast, up from 57.2 percent a year earlier, the annual report also showed. Imports from Ghana rose to 17.6 percent from 14.1. VRBF noted German imports from Malaysia fell drastically to 1,579 tonnes in 1996 from 8,241 tonnes in 1995 and versus nearly 50,000 tonnes in the early 1990s. Malaysia now processes more than 80 percent of its cocoa at home. South East Asian suppliers accounted for just 12 percent of bean imports into Germany in 1996 after 16 percent in 1995. West Africa's share was nearly 85 percent from 59. --Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275

CCAT	Eastern Aluminium Ltd, which holds 10 percent of Australia's Portland smelter, said on Thursday a weak aluminium price and a strong Australian dollar weighed unfavourably on its bottom line in 1996. Eastern earlier on Wednesday reported a 56 percent drop in net profit to A$4.64 million for calendar 1996. "Average aluminium prices received in 1996 were 17.8 percent lower and the average Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate received was 6.1 percent higher than in 1995," Eastern said.   The company's share of aluminium production at Portland in 1996 was 29,182 tonnes, which was marginally higher than 1995 production share of 29,043 tonnes. As a consequence of new metal sales arrangements introduced in 1996, the company now carries modest operating stocks. As a result, 1996 sales of 28,567 tonnes were slightly lower than in 1995 when all production was sold, Eastern said. The company's main operating costs are for alumina and power, both of which flex with aluminium prices with a lag of three months, it said.   The demand outlook for aluminium is strong, particularly in Asia, the company said. "The industry is continuing to adjust to the over-supply position of the early 1990s. Aluminium prices have recovered from the low levels of the second half of 1996 and the current price of around $US 1,575/tonne is well ahead of the average 1996 price of $US1,506/tonne," Eastern said. If prices can be maintained at around current levels, profits will improve through 1997, the company said. Market premiums that the company earns on aluminium sales will also be higher in 1997, it said.

GCAT	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov met for five hours on Monday but failed to resolve differences over the Western alliance's enlargement plans. Their meeting, shrouded in secrecy at an official residence outside Moscow, produced agreement only on a schedule for more talks and on the fact that negotiations between the two former Cold War foes will not be easy over the next few months. "The meeting was useful although, of course, there are different approaches on a range of questions," a brief Russian foreign ministry statement said. "Discussions will be continued. A timetable has been set for future work. It is clear that it will not be easy but the two sides will try to make them a success." A statement issued at NATO headquarters in Brussels was almost identical. Relations are overshadowed by disagreement over NATO's plans to take in former Soviet bloc countries from eastern and central Europe. Moscow says such expansion would threaten its security and cause new divisions in Europe. Little time remains for reaching an understanding before a July summit in Madrid at which NATO is expected to issue invitations to the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Solana was expected to address Moscow's concerns by discussing terms for a special relationship with Russia and holding out the prospect of setting up a permanent mechanism for joint consultations. Both sides played down the likelihood of a major breakthrough before the talks and made clear the path to agreement would be long and difficult. "It is just the first round...in mutual relations between Russia and NATO," Sergei Yastrzhembsky, President Boris Yeltsin's press secretary, told a Kremlin briefing. "I wouldn't have raised expectations about this meeting between Solana and Primakov," he said. The chances of breaking the impasse appeared particularly low without the presence of Yeltsin, 65, who left hospital on Monday after 12 days of treatment for pneumonia. Yeltsin dominates foreign policy and all major decisions depend on him. Yeltsin, his grip on power already in question because of his health problems, will be open to fierce criticism by his political rivals if he fails to win concessions before NATO expansion goes ahead. Yastrzhembsky made clear Moscow would not accept vague promises from NATO. "Russia and NATO must move to specific, hard and concrete discussions. Moscow doesn't believe in vague declarations and eloquent promises...which are not written down," he said. "The period of romanticism in diplomacy is over," he said in reference to a honeymoon period in relations with the West as the Soviet Union collapsed. The Kremlin turned its attention firmly back to foreign policy after Yeltsin ended almost six months out of his Kremlin office with health problems on December 23, two months after he had heart surgery. He has ordered the foreign ministry to start drawing up a set of possible responses to an enlarged NATO. Western diplomats say Russia appears intent on delaying enlargement, limiting the number of countries that join NATO and seeking as many concessions as possible.
ECAT	Nigeria's military ruler on Saturday said external debt had fallen in 1996, but stressed the need for rescheduling and said the same $2.0 billion would be earmarked for repayments in 1997. External debt stood at $28.060 billion at the end of December 1996 from $32.585 billion a year earlier. "As a result of adroit debt management for the first time in over a decade, and without fresh debt rescheduling, this government has succeeded in reversing the trend of rising external debt stock," General Sani Abacha said in his 1997 budget address. He did not give precise details of how the debt had been reduced. Roughly the same amount, $2.0 billion, has been set aside for external debt servicing for the past five years. Despite the fall in external debt in 1996, Abacha said the debt profile was unsustainable and stressed the need for relief from the Paris Club of governments which accounts for over 60 percent of the debt. He said that finalising a Medium Term Economic Strategy (MTES) with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank would be essential before any approach to the Paris Club could be made.   "During 1997 the major focus of Nigeria's relationship with the IMF and World Bank would be accelerated and intensive negotiation and finalisation of the MTES," said Abacha.
GCAT	Warlord Charles Taylor has halted his campaign for Liberia's presidency, bowing to a ban from the electoral commission which is discussing whether to postpone national elections scheduled for May 30. Taylor said his decision to suspend the campaign, begun on Friday, followed a letter from the electoral commission about a ban on campaigning. He made his position known in a radio broadcast on Monday. Elections are pencilled in for May 30, but the head of the electoral commission has travelled to West African giant and power broker Nigeria to consult military ruler General Sani Abacha on a possible change of date. Among the aspirants only Taylor, who plunged Liberia into civil war in 1989, favours the May election date. Election officials say nine parties have registered for the ballot, part of a peace plan brokered by Liberia's neighbours and backed by their Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force ECOMOG. ECOMOG says it has gone a long way towards disarming the country's faction fighters. The electoral commission, preparing for both legislative and presidential elections, still needs to recruit thousands of registrars for voting to take place. Taylor's supporters took to the streets of the capital and parts of the interior last week, doling out election freebies -- tee-shirts, posters and stickers. "We are obligated under the law to suspend the campaigning," said Arthur Massaquoi, public affairs officer of Taylor's National Patriotic Party (NPP). Taylor's opponents include fellow faction leader Alhaji Kromah and U.N. Development Programme Africa director Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. The NPP's deputy national chairman, Christian Helbert, told a radio phone-in on Monday that trouble would follow if elections were delayed. He added that his partisans would resist the imposition of a new date. The civil war, which has killed well over 150,000 people, began as an attempt by Taylor and his allies to drive coup-maker Master Sergeant Samuel Doe from power but disintegrated into a struggle for power among rival factions. As many as one-half of Liberia's pre-war population of 2.5 million people have been displaced or have fled abroad. Several hundred thousand refugees are in neighbouring Ivory Coast, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Liberia was founded by freed American slaves in 1847.

GCAT	President Bill Clinton said on Friday he expected to face "tough" issues like NATO expansion in talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin this month but voiced hope for progress during their two-day summit. Clinton and Yeltsin begin talks on March 19 in Helsinki, a neutral site chosen to spare the Russian leader any undue physical strain following his heart surgery last year and a bout with double pnemonia this year. "It'll be a meeting that'll be extremely candid, extremely ... straightforward," Clinton told a televised news conference from the East Room of the White House. "I expect that the Helsinki meeting will be positive," he said. "But you should understand that this is a tough debate and that they have reasons in their own psyche and circumstances that make it a difficult one." Yeltsin has been particularly troubled by NATO plans to expand the alliance by extending an invitation in July to some former East Bloc nations. Washington has been trying to reassure Moscow that expansion would pose no military threat and Clinton said at his news conference that NATO wants "a special relationship with Russia and does not rule out even Russian membership in a common security alliance." In his upcoming summit, he said, "the best answer I can give to President Yeltsin is, what are we doing with NATO and with whom are we doing it." He noted that the United States has been actively engaged it trying to maintain a peace in Bosnia. "We together ended the bloodiest war in Europe since World War II and we are doing it with Russia," he said. U.S. and European diplomats have been working behind the scenes to allay Russian concerns about expansion of NATO, noting that once invitations were issued it would take several years before the alliance actually was enlarged. Invitations to join NATO are expected to be issued at a July summit of the alliance to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Clinton said he hoped the Helsinki summit "will deal with not only the question of Russia's relationship to Europe but also what we can do with the Russians to continue to reduce the nuclear threat and what we can do with the Russians to help them to build their economy." Despite Russia's struggle to adopt to a free market economy he said he was "convinced that they have the capacity, if they can make certain changes, to enjoy a phenomenal amount of economic growth in a relatively short time." Clinton, sounding confident heading into the talks with Yeltsin, declared that "we're trying to work together for a better, brighter world." After the summit concludes on March 20, Clinton will visit Copenhagen and then head back to Washington on March 21.
MCAT	CSCE cocoa futures ended higher in uneventful trading on Wednesday, bolstered by speculative buying and local short-covering on the heels of Tuesday's downturn, dealers said. Active December rose $12 a tonne on the day, to $1,527, after ranging narrowly from $1,532 to $1,520. Spot September ended $7 firmer, at $1,499, while the back months gained $13 to $18.

GCAT	Larry Walker kept up his torrid early-season home run pace to help the surging Colorado Rockies outslug the Montreal Expos 12-8 on Saturday for their seventh consecutive victory. (Corrects day to Saturday) Walker hit his league-leading seventh homer and Vinny Castilla matched Walker's two-run shot with his fifth in a four-run second inning that followed a four-run first. "I don't think when different teams face me they consider me a home run threat," Walker said. "Let's see how long it continues. I let you know if I'm a slugger come October and we total them up." Kirt Manwaring had four of Colorado's 13 hits and drove in two runs and Andres Galarraga delivered a two-run single for the Rockies, who have gone undefeated since dropping the first two games of the season on the road. Jamey Wright (2-0) picked up the victory despite allowing six runs and 11 hits over seven innings. "I wasn't really happy with my numbers," said Wright, who had trouble pitching in bitter cold after trying to bat. "I hit it off the end of the bat and my fingers went numb. The first two hitters (I pitched to), I couldn't feel my middle fingers, and I thought, 'I hope this goes away real quick.'" Jim Bullinger (0-2) was rocked for eight runs, six hits and four walks in just 1 2/3 innings and suffered the loss. David Segui and Rondell White hit solo homers to pace Montreal's 14-hit attack. The Expos (3-5) have lost five in a row after opening the season with three wins. In Cincinnati, Pokey Reese, recalled from the minors earlier in the day, made the most of his first big-league hit by driving in the winning run in the 10th inning to lift the Reds to a 2-1 victory over the Florida Marlins. Reese, starting at shortstop in place of injured star Barry Larkin, smacked a two-out single down the right-field line in the bottom of the 10th, bringing home Eric Owens and ending Cincinnati's five-game losing streak and Florida's five-game winning streak. "It's a dream come true," said Reese. "First big-league hit and RBI and it wins the game." Reds starter Mike Morgan allowed a run on four hits in 5-1/3 innings, with Stan Belinda, Mike Remlinger, Jeff Shaw and winner Hector Carrasco holding the potent Florida offence hitless the rest of the way. In Chicago, Jeff Blauser singled home Ryan Klesko from second with two outs in the ninth inning as the Atlanta Braves kept the Cubs winless with a 2-1 victory. Chicago has lost its first nine games for the worst start in team history, while the Braves improved to 7-3. "The hardest part is after the game, just trying to make sense out of losing this many in a row," said Cubs verteran second baseman Ryne Sandberg. Mike Bielecki (1-0) pitched a scoreless eighth to pick up the win in relief of Greg Maddux. Klesko also scored the Braves other run. He hit a one-out double in the fourth and came home when shortstop Shawon Dunston threw the ball away after a grounder by Eddie Perez. In St Louis, Bobby Abreu had a pinch-hit bases-loaded triple in a four-run sixth inning and Ramon Garcia pitched five solid innings in his first National League start as the Houston Astros held on for a 7-5 victory over the Cardinals. Rookie Abreu emptied the bases for a 6-2 Astros lead with his triple into the right-field corner off Todd Stottlemyre (0-1). He scored on a sacrifice fly by Pat Listach. Jeff Bagwell smacked a solo homer in the third and scored twice for the Astros. Abreu was batting for Garcia (1-0), who gave up two runs and four hits in picking up the win.
CCAT	South Korea's second biggest steel maker said on Friday it would file for court protection from its creditors, dealing a new blow to an economy reeling from almost a month of strikes. Hanbo Steel Corp, flagship of South Korea's 14th largest industrial conglomerate, defaulted on debt payments on Thursday. Analysts said its collapse could spark a chain reaction of corporate bankruptcies and threaten banks. Hanbo said it planned to file a court petition on Monday that would allow it to freeze payments on total debt of almost five trillion won ($5.8 billion). Seeking to avert a financial crisis, the central Bank of Korea said it would pump liquidity into the financial system to ease a credit squeeze caused by the Hanbo failure, one of the most spectacular in South Korean history. It also said it would make available emergency funds to Hanbo's suppliers and subcontractors that would be devastated by any debt repayment freeze. Hanbo's collapse was caused largely by plant expansion it could not afford and had no direct connection to work stoppages sparked by passage of a new labour law that makes it easier for companies to lay off workers. Nevertheless, it has sent shivers through labour unions who believe companies suffering from an economic downturn will seek to trim costs with staff redundancies. Bankruptcies are rare in South Korea, where the government supports ailing companies indirectly by forcing banks to extend loans that make no commercial sense. Economists said that if by allowing Hanbo to flop, authorities were signalling they would no longer prop up loss-making firms, an industrial shakeout could be on the way. "Hanbo's default may signal the beginning of a chain reaction of corporate failures," said Lee Hahn-ku, president of Daewoo Research Institute. "It is a big shock to the financial community. It could spark unemployment," Lee said. He added: "Bankruptcies in the industrial sector will hit the financial community, which has been hostage to the government's industrial policy of picking winners and providing unlimited amounts of loans." Banks on Friday were trying to stitch together a rescue package for Hanbo. A total of 45 banks and other financial institutions have lent money to the company. Korea First Bank has the largest exposure of 1.1 trillion won. Other major creditors are the Korea Development Bank, Chohung Bank and Korea Exchange Bank. Kim Joon-il, an economist at the Korea Development Institute, said some banks could be so severely hurt that the failure could hasten widely anticipated mergers and acquisitions in the financial industry. "No one will want to take over Hanbo unless banks or the government write off much of the debt," said Lee of Daewoo. Analaysts said the crisis as Hanbo Steel would have a domino effect on the group's other 21 subsidiaries because of cross-investments and cross-loan guarantees. Banks said they planned to ask Pohang Iron and Steel Co, the country's largest steel maker, to complete expansion of Hanbo's mill in the southern city of Tangjin. The mill has so far cost 4.96 trillion won and a further 750 billion won is needed. Hanbo's default drove Seoul stocks lower in early trading on Friday, but the market rebounded on bargain-hunting and the main index ended fractionally higher at 679.56 points. ($1=854 won)
GCAT	The Australian winner of the 1996 Nobel Medicine Prize said on Monday he was elated by the recognition for a breakthrough in immunology that he and a Swiss colleague made 23 years ago. "It's a fantastic feeling...I'm still in a state of shock. It is a tremendous recognition," Peter Doherty told Reuters in a telephone interview from his home in Memphis. "It wasn't totally unexpected," he added, though. Doherty, 55, shared the prize with Rolf Zinkernagel, 52, of the University of Zurich, for discoveries made while working in Australia on how the immune system detects virus-infected cells, Sweden's Karolinska Institute said. The two men will share $1.12 million as their prize. Doherty, who now works at a cancer hospital for children in the United States, said the discovery of the basic principle of how the killer T-cell works was made in 1973 and has since mushroomed into an enormous field in immunology. "It was a major discovery. It was completely new, something nobody suspected," he said. "It triggered a new direction in research. It targeted a whole new way of looking at the problem and this was not understood immediately," said Doherty, who is now chairman of the Department of Immunology at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. He said the discovery brought about a new way of understanding how viruses should be controlled and how to make vaccines. Doherty has lived for eight years in Memphis, where he is also a professor at the University of Tennessee's College of Medicine. Doherty began his career as a veterinary officer at Brisbane's Animal Research Institute after attending universities in the Australian state of Queensland and Edinburgh, Scotland. The Karolinska Institute in Stockholm said the work of Zinkernagel and Doherty at the John Curtin School of Medical Research in Canberra from 1973 to 1975 had been crucial for understanding how the human body recognised viruses. The scientists used mice to study how the immune system and particularly T-lymphocytes -- which protect the body against infection -- protected animals. Infected mice developed "killer lymphocytes," which in a test tube could kill cells that had been infected with a virus. The two men made another unexpected discovery -- that the lymphocytes were only active against a specific virus in a specific mouse and would not protect a different animal. Doherty said he worked in the United States because it was the world leader in bio-medical research thanks to the "tremendous support" in funding given by the U.S. government. The Nobel prize will likely distract him from his scientific work for a while. "This probably means I won't get much work done in the next 12 months," he said.
ECAT	Ireland's government on Monday hailed 1996 trade figures which showed record exports and a record trade surplus but pledged to broaden the country's export base by encouraging smaller firms. Figures released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) showed an increase in Ireland's trade surplus to 7.34 billion Irish pounds in 1996 from 7.21 billion in 1995. The value of exports climbed to 30.01 billion pounds from 27.82 billion the previous year, while imports rose to 22.35 billion from 20.62 billion, the CSO said. "Both the figure for total exports and the trade surplus are records and they further underline the present outstanding health of our economy," trade minister Enda Kenny said in a statement. "The surplus...is more than the combined surpluses for the first three years of this decade." He said the government would focus its attention on boosting the exports of smaller and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as exports are dominated by large firms, with 10 companies accounting for 25 percent of Irish exports. "The government's export promotion focus will continue to be on indigenous firms, especially SMEs, which have their own star performers but where the exporting base needs to be broadened," Kenny said. -- Dublin newsroom +353 1 661 3377
ECAT	Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong arrived in Harare on Friday for a three-day official visit aimed at forging closer political and trade ties with Zimbabwe. Goh is due to hold talks with President Robert Mugabe during his visit, while his 80-member delegation, including some leading industrialists, talks to their business counterparts. The team from Singapore told reporters it was interested in investment and trade in several areas such as infrastructure development, food processing, information technology and clothing manufacturing. Trade between the two countries was valued at Z$147 million ($13 million) in 1995, with the trade balance in favour of Singapore, according to the latest available official statistics. $1=11.1550
MCAT	Spanish government bonds closed little changed after a stagnant session, with traders remaining on the sidelines awaiting the outcome of today's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington. Although the market has discounted that U.S. rates will remain steady amid mixed signals about the economy, many dealers preferred to hold their fire until the news was confirmed. "We're waiting for the Fed, and above all the Bundesbank after (German) July M3 (money supply) came in lower than expected," said an analyst. The council of the German central bank meets on Thursday to discuss interest rates.
CCAT	Swedish insurance company Trygg-Hansa AB's cooperation with Swedish mutual life company Forenade Liv on group insurance policies will provide a good springboard for growth, mainly through new group products, according to the two companies. The companies also hope to take market shares of traditional sectors, Trygg-Hansa spokesman Mats Hoglund said. "We work today with life and health insurance. We think that we can work with other areas like home insurance and security insurance," Hoglund said. "When looking at non-life insurance, we cover 15-20 percent of the market, while we are clearly bigger on group life insurances," he said. "It's not impossible for an upturn of 50 percent on non-life insurance for the groups available today. "In addition, we, of course, want to take market shares in the traditional areas." Hoglund points to social security insurances as a market that can be penetrated through group insurances. "One example is dental insurance," he said. "If you have individual insurances, we have to check everybody's teeth, but group insurances mean a more efficient way of setting prices. "On the pension side, you could play with the idea that 100,000 people save 500 crowns a month -- that's a lot of money," he said. The president of Forenade Liv, Kjell-Ake Persson, also sees large growth potential for group insurances in the future. The new joint venture on sales and administration with Trygg-Hansa, announced on Tuesday, gives further possibilities for growth, according to Persson. "Most Swedes are members of associations where a group insurance solution is possible," Persson told Reuters. "These can be unions, companies or interest groups and I'm convinced that group insurances will grow sharply." According to Persson, the total premium income from group insurances was 3.3 billion crowns in 1995. Of the total, group life insurance amounted to about 3.1 billion crowns and group health care insurers for 200 million crowns. Persson sees a very large growth ahead, mainly on the group health care side. "Group health care insurances have, despite the low total figures, showed sharp growth during the past years," he said. "As long as the sick leave pay was 90 percent, there was no room for group health care insurances, but now the market looks completely different." The new company's aim is to attempt to make group solutions for most insurance products. "As new needs occur, we, along with Trygg-Hansa's products, are able to meet them," Persson said. -- Jorgen Osterberg, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1008
GCAT	Burma's military government imposed martial law and a curfew in its second city of Mandalay following recent demonstrations by Buddhist monks, residents and diplomats said on Wednesday. Residents said a curfew was imposed from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. in five townships in Mandalay, effective from Monday. They said Mandalay newspapers reported that martial law was also in place, effective on March 18. Diplomats said they had not heard about martial law being imposed, but said barricades had been set up on some Mandalay streets and that the main market had been closed. "The government is worried about unrest, so they are being very cautious about security," one diplomat said. Government spokesmen were not available for comment despite repeated attempts to reach them. But earlier this week government sources confirmed there had been a demonstration by monks in Mandalay over the weekend. The officials had said the protest was quelled without incident. Diplomats said the restrictions came after weekend riots between Buddhist monks and Moslems. At least two mosques were destroyed and several people were injured in attacks that appeared to be in retaliation for the rape of a young Buddhist girl by a Moslem businessman, one diplomat said. "My understanding is that there were riots on the 15th and 16th. It seemed to be more of a socio-religious problem than a political protest," said another diplomat. Sources in the military government had said the monk demonstration occurred on March 15. Mandalay is the cultural centre of Burma and is home to a large number of monks. Buddhist monks played a key role in the pro-democracy uprisings that began in 1988, when hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest against the military regime. At the time, prominent monks appeared on television and appealed to the public to stay calm and pursue their cause peacefully, while at the same time urging military leaders to listen to the people and not use force. The demonstrations were eventually quashed by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) in a bloody crackdown that left thousands of people -- including monks -- dead or in jail. Shortly after the 1988 demonstrations, monks continued to be involved in protests against the military, especially in Mandalay. Their protest tactics included a boycott on performing religious services for soldiers and their families. But since then the Buddhist monks have been largely silenced, partly through intimidation and in part through offerings given to top monks by SLORC. But diplomats and analysts say there have been some signs recently of unrest among younger monks who want to see a democratic Burma. Opposition sources say support from monks would be crucial for major change to take place in Burma.

MCAT	The Amman bourse dropped again on Sunday in stagnant trade with minimal purchasing activity by investors depressing overall prices, brokers said. The official 60-share Amman Financial Market (AFM) index slid another 0.21 percent to 150.00 points in poor turnover worth only 265,270 dinars ($374,675). The bourse continued to falter for the seventh consecutive session to hover around it lowest levels since late November, which it reached again last week.   "There is no impetus to the market, there is a recession in activity... with irregular trades on some stock whose pattern is not repeating itself the next day," said broker Husam Hanbali. The only performer, in otherwise weak trade across the board, was Jordan Cement Factory, which was unchanged at 3.78 dinars in the busiest stock traded on Sunday. Its 76,369 dinars worth of business was at least double the more modest amounts in most of the active stock. Arab Bank rose a marginal 0.500 dinar to 255.50 dinars in low turnover of 20,440 dinars. Overall falling shares outnumbered gainers by 20 to 6, with another eleven closing unchanged. ((-- Amman newsroom +9626 623776))
GCAT	The leader of a planned intervention force for eastern Zaire left Rwanda on Tuesday acknowledging differences existed between the United Nations and the Rwandan government on the need for the force. Canadian Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril was speaking at the end of an assessment mission with U.N. troubleshooter Raymond Chretien during which they met Rwandan Vice-President Paul Kagame. "There is a different opinion (between us and the Rwandan government) and that is why I am here. I am really trying to clarify what is going on," Baril told reporters. Rwanda earlier said there was no need for a military intervention force now since almost all the Rwandan Hutu refugees had returned home. "They (Rwanda) feel that most of the problem has been solved and therefore they don't see any need for the same kind of military mission as envisaged a week ago, so that's clearly their position," Chretien said. "We have to know what is happening on the other side (of the border). There are still approximately between 300,000-500,000 according to our best estimates and we have to know a bit more about what is happening to them," he said. Resolving those differences in part depended on a precise assessment of the refugee situation in eastern Zaire. Baril was due to go to Uganda and then Stuttgart, Germany, for a meeting with other countries participating in the planned intervention force, while Chretien was bound for Kinshasa. "No recommendations, no decisions have been made by the troops contributors so far and I haven't put my recommendations in yet," Baril said on the upcoming meeting. Earlier Rwanda's foreign minister said the force was no longer needed since there were hardly any refugees left in eastern Zaire, contrary to U.N. estimates that well over half a million remained. "These refugees who have returned home number 500,000 people, which broadly matches the real number of Rwandan refugees previously in eastern Zaire, in North and South Kivu," Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana said in a statement. "We're not saying that there's not a single refugee in eastern Zaire," Gasana told a news conference. "There could be a few who are tired and can't walk, but the great mass has returned." Gasana's statistics bore no relation to figures provided by the United Nations and aid agencies. The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR says there were 1.1 million Rwandan Hutus and 150,000 Burundian Hutus in camps in eastern Zaire before the start of a rebellion by Zairean rebels last month which led to the mass return of Rwandan Hutus. UNHCR is the source for the estimated 500,000 returning refugees since November 15, but it and aid agencies on the ground say there are hundreds of thousands more Rwandan and Burundian refugees scattered in eastern Zaire. In his statement Gasana said Hutu refugees thought to be in Zaire's South Kivu province had pushed north because of the fighting and had concentrated in the Mugunga and Lac Vert camps in North Kivu, eventually joining the refugees from those camps in a mass return to Rwanda. In Paris, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said there were still 300,000 refugees in Bukavu, 200,000 in Uvira in South Kivu province and 200,000 near Goma in North Kivu. "The threat of an unprecedented humanitarian disaster remains. We must ensure the security of relief convoys," he said.
MCAT	Gold was back near four-month lows in early European trade on Monday, with U.S. fund selling seen as a factor behind the latest declines. Trade remained quiet, however, one Swiss-based dealer said. Gold was quoted in early Europe at $337.20/$337.60 an ounce versus $338.20/$338.70 at the London close on Friday. Gold closed in New York Friday at $337.40/90. At current levels, gold was near lows last seen when it fell to $336.15 on February 12. That low, on a monthly chart, was the lowest for gold since it fell to $334.40 at the end of April 1993. Silver weakened to $4.72/$4.74 from the London close of $4.74/$4.76. Platinum fell to $421.00/$426.00 versus $423.00/$428.00. Palladium was higher, however, at $202.00/$207.00 versus $194.00/$199.00. -- Zurich newsroom, +41 1 631 7340
GCAT	French Prime Minister Alain Juppe won backing from Corsican deputies on Wednesday for a crackdown on separatist violence as guerrillas blamed for bombings on the Mediterranean island accused him of burying a peace process. Several of the seven deputies and senators said after they met Juppe that they supported his "policy of firmly maintaining republican law" on the French island, hit by a wave of bombings targeting public buildings and magistrates. "I'm an opposition parliamentarian, I express some differences on social and economic policy, but on the need to re-establish the rule of law, I support him totally," Radical Socialist deputy Emile Zuccarelli told reporters. Parliament member and former industry minister Jose Rossi urged the French National Assembly to set up a parliamentary mission on Corsica. Juppe's office said in a statement that the premier, flanked by five cabinet ministers, had detailed his law and order policy and his plan for tax breaks to boost Corsica's ailing economy. French media said security was tightened at public buildings in Paris, with some police wearing bullet-proof vests, after suspected Corsican separatists made telephone threats of machinegun attacks. Police declined comment. In an earlier statement, Corsica's outlawed separatist FLNC movement accused the government of wrecking a peace process. The Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) Historic Wing accused Paris of "willingly letting the situation rot to bring the Corsican question back to a simple law and order issue". "The government has chosen provocation," it said. The movement seeks greater autonomy from the mainland and called off a shaky truce in mid-August. It urged its militants "to signal everywhere their determination to survive and for emancipation". "Juppe's move, signalled by the round-up of Ajaccio (suspects), seals the liquidation by the state of the peace process," it said, referring to the seizure of six suspected guerrillas put under investigation by a Paris anti-terrorism judge. In the island's capital Ajaccio, some 100 demonstrators occupied the chamber of the Corsican assembly on Wednesday, demanding talks with a representative of Juppe, and recognition of the Corsican people. A spokesman for the protesters, chiefly workers from the tourism, transport, fishing and farming sectors, said they would continue the occupation until their demand had been met.

ECAT	Illinois lawmakers authorized $167 million of bonds for capital maintenance projects in their fiscal 1998 budget, a state budget bureau spokeswoman said Monday. Lawmakers included dozens of smaller maintenance projects as part of an approximately $35.6 billion all-funds budget approved at the close of their session at the end of May, spokeswoman Ellen Feldhausen said. They approved spending $98.358 million from the Capital Development Fund, $60 million from the Transportation Series B Fund and $18.7 million from the Anti-Pollution Fund on numerous projects, according to a budget bureau summary. Scheduled projects include improvements to prisons, health facilities, a courthouse roof, drinking water facilities and wastewater treatment plants. The bond authorization and actual spending on projects differs as a result of varying schedules, Feldhausen said. Lawmakers approved an $18.175 billion general fund budget for fiscal 1998 beginning July 1. ((--David Bailey, Chicago Newsroom, 312-408-8647))
MCAT	German shares traded in or around record territory on Wednesday, as a strong close on Wall Street overnight and a strengthening dollar boosted sentiment on the IBIS DAX index. The index of electronic trade was up around half a percent, or 18.67 points, at 3,684.10 points, while the June DAX future contract was up 17 points at 3,691. "Wall Street was up yesterday and it looks like we're trying to emulate that good order flow here. This is not a down day and I think it's very possible that we could break 3,700 points today," said a Frankfurt broker.   "There is a lot of merger talk out there today, especially since Roche bought Boehringer Mannheim the other day, and people are looking at the banking sector closely," he said. One of the main engines behind the advance was industrial giant Daimler Benz. It was one of the volume leaders early on and advanced strongly after it said it expected "substantial" increases in 1997 sales and operating profits. The share rose to a high of 137.45 marks at one point, before falling back to 136.75 marks later, up 65 pfennigs. "The Daimler sales figures for the first four months did not disappoint and were well received," a trader said.   Shares in insurer Allianz AG rose after it said it expected its premium income to rise around 11 percent to around 83 billion marks in 1997 and said it expected moderate double-digit growth in 1997. The share rose 4.50 marks to a new high of 383.50 marks, jumping 3.50 marks after the announcement. Floor-covering manufacturer Tarkett saw its shares advance nearly 12 percent to 33.50 marks after it said it was merging its worldwide floor covering business with that of French group Sommer Allibert Sa. --Clifford Coonan, Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
GCAT	Israel said on Tuesday its forces had killed at least one guerrilla during an overnight clash in its south Lebanon occupation zone. "At least one terrorist was killed when an Israeli army force on an operational initiative on the border of the eastern sector of the south Lebanon security zone encountered a terrorist cell," the army said in a statement. It said there were no Israeli casualties. Iranian-backed Hizbollah (Party of God) guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli troops and their local militia allies from a 15-km (nine mile)-wide border zone they hold in south Lebanon. Israel set up the zone in 1985 after withdrawing the bulk of its forces following the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Israel said on Monday its troops had killed two guerrillas. Hizbollah said on Saturday Israel had killed two of its fighters in an air raid.
GCAT	Burma's military government on Saturday showed no sign of relaxing restrictions on the movements of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The government said bombing incidents in Rangoon this week required its vigilance on security. A military spokesman said he could not say when the government would ease its requirement that the Nobel Peace laureate seek advance military permission to leave her lakeside residence in central Rangoon. Two bombs exploded at a Buddhist site in a northern Rangoon suburb on Wednesday, killing five people and wounding 17. Asked when the military would allow Suu Kyi's free movement, the spokesman said: "Under the current situation, it is very hard to say...We still have to be extra careful." The ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) on Friday allowed Suu Kyi to leave her house for the first time in three weeks. The opposition leader visited the tomb of her mother Khin Kyi at a cemetery on the eighth anniversay of her death. Tin Oo, deputy leader of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), said she and NLD members held a 15-minute Buddhist prayer service at the tomb. The SLORC had since December 3 restricted Suu Kyi's movement after nearly 2,000 university students took to the streets at the start of a series of the biggest anti-government demonstrations seen in Rangoon since 1988. Tin Oo said Suu Kyi had no specific plans to leave her compound next week as she did not like to ask for what she regarded as her legal right to freedom of movement. Suu Kyi and the student protesters have denied any political links but the government has accused some NLD members, exiled students and outlawed Burmese communists of instigating the protests. The government had blamed this week's bomb blasts on the exiled All-Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF) and the rebel Karen National Union (KNU). The ABSDF has denied any link to the bomb attack. The bombs exploded at different places at the Buddhist site, where thousands of pilgrims had gathered to pay homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic, which was on loan from China. The second explosion caused all the deaths and injuries. A commentary in state-run newspapers on Saturday said the bombing incidents could not harm Burmese-Chinese relations. It said: "China and Myanmar have been united since they were born. Those wishing to obstruct the greatness of Sino-Myanmar relations have caused explosions and destruction." The papers quoted Russian ambassador Valeri Nazarov as saying: "This unprecedentedly cynical act of terrorism can cause nothing but the strongest feelings of shock, indignation and protest."
MCAT	The Bulgarian lev edged up to 216-217 per dollar at the close from 217-218 in the morning due to support from the central bank and amid low foreign currency demand on the interbank market, dealers said. "The central bank offered dollars between 218-219 levs throughout the day, deterring a possible lev's fall," one dealer said. Commercial banks also actively offered foreign currency with most of their dollar asks below the central bank's ones, which further supported the lev amid the relatively low dollar demand, the dealer said. BNB officials declined comment. Movements in the lev/dollar exchange rate next week were likely to be almost entirely dependent on the central bank, which helped the lev to recover to today's closing levels from 223 on Monday through its active dollar sales. -- Anastas Petrov, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561
MCAT	Yen-based Tokyo precious metals futures ended lower across the board on Wednesday, weighed down by the yen's firmer tendency against the dollar and weak bullion prices, traders said. Gold futures ranged from seven yen to 14 yen per gram lower. Benchmark April was off 13 yen at 1,372 yen. "Although the yen's firmer tone has poured cold water on sentiment in the gold futures market, private investors were tending to hunt for bargains most of the day after taking profits on Tuesday," an analyst at a commodity brokerage said.   Spot bullion was quoted at $340.35/65 per ounce at 0730 GMT, against $340.30/80 in New York on Tuesday. In the bullion market, buying by Japanese traders was matched by selling from Australian producers, dealers said. "Buying by Japanese traders in arbitrage dealings was countered by hedge selling by Australian producers," one trader said. He said spot gold sentiment remained weak on lingering concern over possible gold sales by European central banks. Platinum and palladium futures were directionless, with private investors quick to take advantage of price dips to cover short positions, while trade houses were generally buying.   Some traders said rumours have circulated the precious metal industry that a Russian trade mission will visit Japan later this month after a long delay, to negotiate the renewal of export contracts for platinum group metals (PGM). They said the PGM industry has not yet received a formal notice from Russia. Platinum futures ranged from five to 12 yen per gram weaker. Benchmark April closed down seven at 1,465 yen. Palladium futures ranged from three to nine yen per gram down, with benchmark April finishing down four at 600 yen. Benchmark April silver was off 2.7 yen at 193.0 yen.

ECAT	The New York State Comptroller on Thursday praised New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for using an unexpected $450 million surge in tax revenues to reduce some of the risks in the city's 1997 fiscal budget. The comptroller, who reviews New York City's budgets and who had blasted the latest $33 billion program for not closing long-term gaps, said he would soon report on the new plan. Saying he was happy the mayor had addressed some of the concerns he had raised, H. Carl McCall said in a statement: "He (Giuliani) is using a portion of the tax windfall to remove the most obvious risks in the fiscal 1997 budget and is proposing some savings as a down-payment to address the still-sizable out-year gaps." The Giuliani Administration projected tax revenues would rise more than it first thought because the financial industry is expected to have big profits. But noting how volatile the industry can be, it is projecting only a $120 million tax surplus in 1998, and a $50 million windfall in 1999.   While the city as expected slashed agency cutbacks in fiscal 1997 to $179 million from this summer's estimate of $500 million, budget director Joseph Lhota told reporters at a news conference that agencies are expected to cut $400 million in 1998, when the budget gap will total $1.23 billion. Parks will see their funding drop by about $7.6 million, Cultural Affairs $12 million, Social Services $38.4 million, Corrections $61 million, and the Health and Hospitals Corp nearly $83 million. The police will lose around $2.3 million and the fire department $2.7 million. One of the city's proposals is expected to win praise from its monitors: it no longer plans to pay for raises won by unionised workers at the Health and Hospitals Corp, the Housing Authority, and the City University of New York. Instead, these so-called covered organisations will have to find the money to pay for the hikes over the next four years. For fiscal 1997, the city raised spending by $202 million. --212-859-1654

"Haier expects to become a serious competitor in the European market for refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, dryers, micro-wave ovens and air conditioners," the company said in a statement issued in the Netherlands. Qingdao-based Haier is market leader in China with 1996 turnover of 1.5 billion guilders. The company said it is well aware of the particulars of the European market because it has bought its technology from major European producers. Haier has agreed on a partnership with Dutch unlisted import and export firm Epogro BV which will organise its distribution and marketing in Europe. The company will start its European operations this year in the Benelux countries and Germany and will expand in France, Britain and Spain in the next three years.

MCAT	CBOT rice futures ended slightly lower on Thursday in quiet, choppy trade with late weakness linked to small sell stops, traders said. "LIT and locals were sellers," a trader said. "They hit some light sell stops at $9.60 (per cwt) in the September." The trade continued to watch crop developments in Vietnam where flooding has damaged up to 500,000 tonnes of rice. But Indian traders said Indian rice exports were unlikely to get a boost from the anticipated rise in Vietnamese rice prices. There was little domestic news to move the market, the traders said. Rice ended one cent per cwt lower with September down one at $9.64. Volume was estimated by CBOT at 300 lots, compared with Wednesday's actual volume of 312 lots. ((Emily Kaiser 312-408-8749))
CCAT	The most extensive oil and gas exploration conducted off the shores of Cambodia yielded no commercially viable wells, exploration firms said on Tuesday. Representatives of Enterprise Oil and Cambodia Petroleum Exploration Co Ltd (Campex) said the disappointing results from four wells drilled in 1996 meant they must now pin their hopes further offshore. They said they were eyeing the Overlapping Claim Area (OCA), a 26,400 square-km central section of the Gulf of Thailand that both Cambodia and Thailand claim to control. "The results are not as good as we hoped (off the Cambodian coast). This makes the OCA more important than ever," Enterprise exploration manager Hugh G.D. Mackay told Reuters. Enterprise, which explored on behalf of its partners British Gas and France's Total, conducted drilling at three wells in 1996 and a fourth well in 1994, said Mackay. The more than $55-million exploration project included extensive seismic tests, he said. "This was very thorough, a very aggressive drilling campaign and a fairly thorough evaluation of our two blocks...but it does look as if the reserves fall below the economic threshold, which is disappointing."   Yoshiro Sasaki, general manager of Campex, a subsidiary of Japan Petroleum Exploration Co Ltd (JAPEX), told Reuters exploration of one well late this year and two in 1993 and 1994 had produced similar results. "We found some oil, but not enough for commercial operations," he said. "Now, everyone is waiting to see about the OCA." The OCA has been disputed for more than two decades. Thailand awarded concessions to the waters in the 1970s, and Cambodia is now evaluating bids for the area. Analysts say that once Cambodia awards its concessions -- a move government officials say will even out the playing field in negotiations with the Thai government -- stalled talks between the two nations may finally move forward. "We hope to award the concessions soon," said a member of a Cambodian interministerial committee charged with evaluating the bids. "We just need to meet and finalise our decision." But analysts say it could easily be another year before Cambodia awards the concessions and many more years before the two countries agree on ownership of the waters. Enterprise and Campex, who have both submitted bids for the OCA, believe the area could prove rich in reserves.   "That's the area where Cambodia has the best chance of generating oil and gas revenue," Mackay said of the OCA. He said he hoped Enterprise's large investment in Cambodia would increase the company's chances of tapping the OCA. "We hope our major commitment we have showed the government will be taken into account," he said, adding that Enterprise "has no intention of shutting down here".
GCAT	Golf legend Arnold Palmer said Friday his doctors said his prostate cancer had been "contained." Palmer, 67, underwent surgery earlier this month, and said "at the moment I'm faced with no treatment. I have the unpleasantness of wearing a catheter for a while. With a little luck, in a short period of time I will have my facilities back. "I've just had the staples removed from surgery. I won't say there's not some discomfort and that I don't get a bit tired towards evening," said Palmer, who is credited with popularising the game in the television era. Palmer, who ranks fourth on the all-time PGA Tour victory list with 60 titles said he was finding it difficult to follow doctor's orders and stay away from golf. "Not doing really very much of anything for six weeks is something ... that I haven't faced in years," said Palmer, who won four Masters titles, two British Opens and one U.S. Open in his legendary career, which also includes 10 Senior titles. "The last time I haven't swung a golf club in six weeks was about 1955. That is something that's going to be very difficult for me," Palmer told reporters at a news conference. Palmer, 67, said he was feeling tired, but that his doctors said he was recovering well from the surgery. "If something went wrong and I had to answer to the Lord, I was ready (but) I won't say I wasn't scared," Palmer said. "I was like anyone else would have been. I was very concerned." Palmer said he opted for surgery to remove the cancer, rather than other forms of treatment, because he wanted to give them "every chance of getting it out". He had "every intention" of playing the Masters at Augusta starting April 10 and he hoped to return for the Bay Hill Invitational, an event he hosts, starting March 20.

MCAT	Thai rubber prices continued to fall this week in line with a regional market trend as activity in the market was limited, trade sources said on Wednesday. There was market talk that the Thai government would soon send a team to Japan to boost sales of rubber to that country after the government said it planned to push China to buy 400,000 tonnes of rubber from Thailand this year. "The market is still hanging over from the unwinding of US rubber stocks. The lower Tokyo prices also weighed the market down," said one Bangkok-based trader. "There was modest buying in the market. China bought some." But the government which tried to shore up domestic prices by buying up to 26,400 tonnes since March 5, had not entered the market this week, trade sources said. The Thai benchmark RSS3 rubber for May delivery slid further to 118.00-119.00 US cents a kg FOB Bangkok compared with 121.00-122.00 cents on Friday.

CCAT	The sale of Rio de Janeiro state bank Banerj, the first privatization of a Brazilian state-owned bank, hinges on Senate approval of a deal resolving Banerj's debts to its pension fund. Under the deal, Rio state will assume all of Banerj's debts to its pension fund, which will be covered by a 2.9 billion reais ($2.7 billion) loan from federal mortgage bank Caixa Economica Federal (CEF). Rio's state legislative Assembly approved the pension package Friday, an assembly spokesman said, but Congress' Senate still has to give its go ahead before the Banerj sell-off can take place as scheduled June 17 on the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange. Local press reports have been speculating that Banerj's sell-off may be delayed again because Senate approval might not arrive in time for the auction to take place. A spokeswoman for the Rio state finance department said the pension package had been sent to the Senate Wednesday. Rio state twice failed last year to sell the bank due to worries on debt. A total of six lawsuits which have been filed against the privatization of Banerj could also scupper the sell-off if any of them result in a court injunction against the sale. Banerj is due to be sold in a closed-envelope auction at a base price of 310 million reais ($289.7 million). Interested pre-qualified buyers had until 1200 local time/1500 GMT Friday to deposit guarantees with the stock exchange clearing house in order to pre-identify themselves for the auction.

ECAT	France's central government budget deficit will be 283 billion francs ($55 billion) in 1997 and the total public deficit will be three percent of gross domestic product (GDP), on target for joining a single European currency, government spokesman Alain Lamassoure said on Wednesday. Speaking after the cabinet approved the 1997 draft budget, Lamassoure also said the deficit of the social security system which funds health care, pensions and family allowances, would around 30 billion francs.   Lamassoure said the budget also contained measures to boost consumer spending, including offering some savers the possibility of early interest payments on popular long-term savings accounts. Prime Minister Alain Juppe said the measures, which would apply to about two million households, would "help fire up the economy". A government statement said the overall public sector deficit took account of funds to be transferred to the state by France Telecom. The state telecoms operator is to hand over 37.5 billion francs to cover future pensions liabilities. The statement also said that the central government deficit would have been around 258 billion francs without income tax cuts promised to the tune of 25 billion francs next year.

GCAT	Five weeks after a disastrous election defeat, France's Gaullist RPR party on Sunday chose former National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin to revitalise the right and lead it back to power. Seguin won 79 percent of the ballots cast at a special congress of the conservative Rally for the Republic party, easily defeating five rival candidates in the contest to succeed the unpopular former prime minister Alain Juppe. Seguin promptly vowed to reunite and expand the right. Responding to fears he might use the party post as a stepping stone to the presidency, he pledged allegiance to Gaullist President Jacques Chirac, whose seven-year term expires in 2002. "We need a truce on grating words and petty resentments," Seguin told the congress of more than 4,000 party activists in the eastern Paris suburb of Vincennes. "This evening Jacques Chirac must know that our movement has decided on reconciliation, renewal and openness in order to better serve him," Seguin said. "To serve the president is to serve France." The rotund Seguin, 54, is a heavyweight orator who led the "no" campaign in a 1992 referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union. He has more recently said he favours the shift to the euro single currency and greater European integration. His ideology is a blend of populism and nationalism. He decided to pursue the party leadership after the right was swept from power by an alliance of Socialists, Copmmunists and Greens in a June 1 parliamentary election. Juppe, who had led the right's losing campaign, accepted responsibility for the defeat and stepped down as prime minister but initially hesitated to give up the RPR leadership post. He ultimately agreed to resign voluntarily. But in a parting shot, he thanked the congress, five years in advance, for supporting Chirac's reelection when his current seven-year presidential term ends in 2002. Following Seguin's victory, the congress was read a message from Chirac, who founded the RPR in 1976 to carry on the traditions of former president Charles de Gaulle. In his message, Chirac expressed confidence in Seguin's leadership and thanked Juppe for his past service. Juppe also pledged support for Seguin. The RPR congress was just one part of a recomposition of the defeated right, over which the weakened president, forced to yield much of his power to a left-wing government led by Socialist Lionel Jospin, has had only limited influence. Seguin has put his rhetorical talent to immediate use in attacking Prime Minister Jospin but has not yet come up with a coherent political line for the new opposition. He has also resumed weekly lunch meetings with Chirac to discuss political strategy. But Seguin has irked the head of state by cutting a deal with a party faction led by ex-prime minister Edouard Balladur, who challenged Chirac during the 1995 presidential campaign. Balladur was loudly booed when he addressed the party congress. In recognition of the strong anti-Balladur sentiment at the congress, Seguin put off his choice of a deputy party leader. The Balladurian wing of the party has pressed for him to name former budget minister Nicolas Sarkozy, who was manager of Balladur's 1995 presidential campaign.

CCAT	Standard & Poor's said on Tuesday it rated a $1.0 billion Euro medium term note programme by NV Energieproduktiebedrijf UNA at AA long-term and the outlook on the rating was stable.   "The rating reflects UNA's stable operating and financial profile as one of the four principal electricity generating companies in the Netherlands, the company's manageable capital expenditure programme, and the limited exposure to commercial risks entailed by the current Netherlands electricity supply industry structure," S&P said in a statement. But it added, "UNA faces some uncertainty regarding the future structure of the Dutch electricity market." UNA shows relatively high financial leverage but cash flow interest cover remains adequate, S&P said, and UNA's financial profile is expected to strengthen over two to three years.   S&P said competition from self-generation, independent power producers and import power sources would put presure on the Dutch generating sector in the years ahead. "UNA's efficiency, ownership ties and incumbent position in the sector will help the company adapt to these pressures," the agency said. S&P will monitor parliamentary discussions on sector restructuring as they evolve in 1996, it said. --International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 6784
MCAT	China's stock markets fell on Wednesday morning as euphoria surrounding the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule dissipated and investors waited for the post-handover trend to become clear, brokers said. Shanghai domestic currency A shares fell about 2.9 percent to 1,268.73 points in late morning trading, while the foreign currency B shares were off 1.45 percent at 80.299 points. "The Hong Kong handover was good for popular feeling, but it doesn't have much meaning for the market," said an analyst at China Southern Securities in Shanghai.

GCAT	Columns of Russian men and equipment trundled out of the shattered Chechen capital on Wednesday as Russian and Chechen commanders sat down for more talks on implementing the ceasefire deal. Grozny, returning to a semblance of normality after some of the bloodiest fighting for more than a year, was quiet as detachments of troops, their trucks and armoured personnel carriers belching black smoke, rolled out of the city. At least one column was bound for the Russian military base at Severny airport, a few km (miles) from the centre of Grozny. Jubilant soldiers in a second column cheered as they drove past. "We are going home, back to Russia," one soldier said. As the troops left the city, Russian commander Vyacheslav Tikomirov and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov sat down for more talks on implementing the ceasefire in the rebel-held village of Novye Atagi, some 20 kms (12 miles) from Grozny. The two men made no comment as they went in for the new round of discussions, Reuters correspondent Dmitry Kuznets said. The truce is the main achievement so far of peace envoy Alexander Lebed, whose efforts to find a political settlement for the 20-month war appear to have been frozen in Moscow. Interfax news agency quoted a Russian military source as saying talks would look at the pace of fulfilling the ceasefire deal, exchanging prisoners and demilitarisation of Grozny. Tikhomirov also wanted to know why Chechens were setting up administrative structures which were not part of the ceasefire. In Grozny Russian officers and Chechen fighters said they hoped for a lasting peace. "This war should have been finished long ago, but nobody knew how to go about it," said Russian lieutenant-colonel Igor Grudnov. "The troops must withdraw, it is the correct decision. Peace had to come some time and it did. Our soldiers and officers did not want to fight." "We have found a common language, it is time to end the bloodshed," said separatist Sultan Miniyev. "They don't want to wage war and neither do we. I think this peace is stable." The pullout, a ceasefire and joint Russian-Chechen military patrols in battered Grozny are key elements of the military agreement hammered out last week by Lebed and Maskhadov. Lebed halted talks with Maskhadov on Sunday and flew to Moscow to get Yeltsin's backing for his plans for a political settlement to end the 20-month conflict. He is still waiting for a response from the president, who is on holiday outside Moscow. A political deal will be the most difficult part of his mission as Lebed must reconcile Chechen demands for independence with Moscow's insistence that the region stay part of Russia. Lebed said he was preparing to return to Chechnya and might leave on Thursday or Friday. He said delays in the political talks with the rebels might disrupt the military agreements. Yeltsin's seeming reluctance to see Lebed, his special envoy to Chechnya, has prompted speculation he is out of touch with reality or is waiting to see if Lebed's peace plans collapse. The latest ceasefire, reached after the separatists seized much of Grozny in an August 6 raid which humiliated the Russian military, has lasted for almost a week, but rebel fighters are clearly in control of the city. Groups of fighters swept through Grozny's rubble-strewn streets in commandeered Russian armoured personnel carriers. Interfax news agency quoted sources at Russia's military headquarters as saying 4,500 rebel fighters were in Grozny, backed by six tanks, 25 armoured personnel carriers and three heavy field guns. But life in Grozny, disrupted by fighting which forced tens of thousands to flee, was slowly returning to normal. Kiosks have opened up again and the range of goods on offer is rising. In one street a middle-aged woman wearing a pink and white headscarf said she was going to visit friends. It seems like we can smell peace. People are already starting to visit each other," she said.

MCAT	The conventional capital markets have nearly stopped being a source of resources for Indian industry, the independent Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) said in its Monthly Review of Indian Economy on Monday. "Three-fourths of the amounts raised during May 1997 were through private placements," CMIE said. Public issues accounted for a meagre two percent of total flotations during the month, CMIE said. Interest rates on the corporate debt issues floated in May 1997 were lower than in recent past, indicating a fall in effective interest rates, the survey said. Debt issues worth 41.92 billion rupees were floated in May 1997. "This was the highest floatation seen in any month during the past two years," CMIE said. State-run mutual fund Unit Trust of India (UTI) brought down the interest rate on its MIP97-I scheme to 14 percent from 15 percent for similar schemes and the Industrial Development Bank of India issued 10.0 billion rupees bonds with a coupon of 13.5 percent. During the first two months of 1997/78 (April-March), 53.25 billion rupees were sought to be raised from the primary capital market which was nearly 78 percent higher than the 29.91 billion rupees raised during the year ago period, CMIE said.

GCAT	An Iraqi newspaper on Friday attacked United Nations chief arms inspector Rolf Ekeus, saying he was not neutral in his dealings with Iraq. The paper of the ruling Baath party al-Thawra also accused Ekeus, head of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction, of not telling the truth in saying that Iraq had not disclosed all its weapons. "We would like to remind Ekeus that the mission assigned to him by the United Nations is rather technical and not political. Therefore, if he adds political aspect to it then he is not neutral ...," the paper said in a front-page editorial signed by its editor-in-chief Sami Mehdi. Thawra was reacting to a news report in al-Ittihad newspaper of the United Arab Emirates which said Ekeus was planning to tour Gulf Arab states this month to seek funds and inform them of the results of his work in Iraq. Ekeus said he needed $36 million to support for one year the work of the UNSCOM in Iraq, which runs inspections by 100 U.N. personnel based in Baghdad. The paper also criticised Ekeus' recent remarks that he would try a new tack with Iraqi political leaders next month in an effort to press Iraq to disclose information on unaccounted for Iraqi ballistic missiles. "...but what takes our attention most is when he says Iraq is still concealing data and that he reached a new approach or tack that it would make his next talks in Baghdad 'decisive'. "Ekeus is mistaken and he is not telling the truth when he says Iraq is deliberately hiding data," the paper said.

MCAT	U.S. stock index futures tumbled sharply in afternoon trade, but most contracts managed to trim losses and end only slightly lower. September Standard and Poor's 500 futures collapsed after a weak Treasury bond futures close and sank to 885.00. Buying quickly materialized at the low and sliced those losses. "The move from 895.00 to 885.00 was violent, and the move back up to 895.00 was pretty orderly," an S&P 500 futures trader said. Several traders said a "buy-the-dips" mentality among money managers helped reverse the late losses.   "Money managers continue to buy the dips," another S&P 500 futures trader said. He said the market became oversold on the decline. "It was ridiculous how it just sank in the hole," he said. The selloff came quickly, just after September Treasury bond futures closed below key support and near session lows. September ended down 18/32 at 111-05/32 after a daily range of 111-22/32 to 111-3/32. September S&Ps, which had earlier managed to climb above key 900.00, quickly slid through layer after layer of sell-stops, traders said.   Traders said Wednesday's and Thursday's action reflected a new, uncertain mood in the market. "I don't think this market knows where it's going next," an S&P 500 trader said. Some said a consolidation period could set in as the market chops around below the record high. Others said a significant correction was needed to blow off some overbought steam and reposition the market for its next leg up. Still others said the market needed little if any time off before charging back into record high territory. Traders said volume was heavy late in the day.   Chicago Mercantile Exchange price boards showed an estimated 74,000 contracts traded in September S&P 500 futures, compared with 72,468 on Wednesday. Early in the session, weakness was tied to weak T-bonds after initial U.S. jobless claims fell by 14,000 to 332,000 in the week ended June 21. Economists had predicted claims of 340,000. At the close, Sept S&Ps were up 2.00 at 894.25, KCBT Value Lines rose 2.10 to 790.60, NYSE Composites were down 0.50 at 466.50, Nikkeis were down 150 at 20,625, Midcap 400s were down 0.85 at 288.55, Nasdaq 100s fell 7.85 to 981.15 and Russell 2000s fell 1.00 to 393.90.

GCAT	Manchester United's quest for another league title appeared to be drawing towards a successful close on Monday but the scrap for England's second European Cup place was only just beginning. United's efficient if unspectacular 2-0 win at Everton on Saturday left them six points clear of the field with just seven league matches remaining. They face the distraction of a European Cup semifinal next month but even their many die-hard and envious opponents find it difficult to envisage Alex Ferguson's maturing side letting a lead like that slip. United's single remaining challenge, as Ferguson acknowledged after Saturday's match, is the possibility of late season fatigue. "We do need to extend the season," he said. "It is totally unfair that we may be asked to play four demanding games in eight days in May. I distinctly remember some bright spark saying this sort of thing would never be allowed in the premier league. Well, it's happening." Ferguson need hardly worry though. The way the season is unravelling, United could be crowned champions before the end of April. Liverpool and Arsenal were due to meet at Highbury later on Monday, effectively to decide which of them will keep the defending champions on their toes in the title run-in. Both sides have 57 points to United's 63. The onus is on Liverpool, with a game in hand and a home fixture against United next month, to make a final assault on their arch-rivals' title. Fourth-placed Newcastle dropped further behind in the race for a lucrative place in the European Cup when they drew 1-1 at Wimbledon on Sunday. And while manager Kenny Dalglish proclaimed afterwards: "We are still realistic title contenders", a place in the UEFA Cup now looks a more realistic prospect for the Tynesiders.
MCAT	German shares ended bourse trade virtually unchanged on Thursday, seemingly in two minds about which direction to pursue after the release of domestic economic data with conflicting messages for the market. The DAX index of Germany's top 30 shares closed 1.26 points down at 2,624.44 on trade described by dealers as limited. Buying was seen as held back by the re-emergence of interest rate fears in the U.S. which drove Wall Street stocks lower on Wednesday, together with doubts over how to interpret new German money supply data and a business confidence study. "People are sitting on their hands at the moment," one dealer said. The August M3 measure of money supply grew 8.7 percent compared to forecasts of around eight percent, in principle countering arguments for another German rate cut. But some economists said the growth was largely the result of an increase in short-term credit and thus not too worrying. The money supply data was followed by publication of August's business climate index by the respected Ifo Institute which showed a widely-expected but marginal increase in business confidence. Neither piece of news was however enough of an impetus to shift the market one way or the other. September DAX futures were livelier in trading ahead of Friday's expiry. The contract was quoted 6.5 points higher at 2,628.5, with December futures 5.5 points higher at 2,645.0. Chemical group Bayer AG saw strong trade, caught up in rumours circulating London that it might be preparing a takeover bid for British drugs firm Zeneca Group Plc. Bayer, whose shares gained 39 pfennigs to 55.43 by the close, described the market talk as speculation.

GCAT	Prepared for Reuters by The Broadcast Monitoring Company -- FACTORY PRICE INFLATION FALLS According to figures from the Office of National Statistics, the level of factory gate inflation in January fell to its lowest level for a decade -- with the price of goods leaving factories during the period having risen by just 1.5 per cent. Thanks in the main to the strength of sterling, the cost of raw materials for manufacturers fell 6.3 per cent during the 12 months to January. However, a quarterly inflation report due on Tuesday from the Bank of England is expected to warn that underlying retail price inflation is in danger of exceeding government targets. -- MANCHESTER TO GET 43 MILLION STG BOOST FOR REBUILDING As part of a continuing effort to rebuild the centre of Manchester, devastated in a huge IRA bomb attack last year, the city has secured 43 million stg in government investment. Manchester Millennium, a group established to oversee the reconstruction, expects the amount of investment in the programme to exceed 500 million stg. Leading retailer Marks & Spencer has announced that it will be building its second-biggest outlet to replace the local store, damaged in the attack. -- BA PROFITS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS British Airways has announced an increase in third quarter profits of 8.7 per cent, to 113 million stg. The figures were above City expectations and resulted in a rise in company share prices. To mark the 10th anniversary of its privatisation, BA is offering 200 return tickets to fly on Concorde to New York for just 10 stg each -- the usual fare is in excess of 5,000 stg. It is reported that analysts have compared BA favourably with European competitors which are turning in much weaker performances. -- TAX EXPERTS CONDEMN 'MONSTROUS' NEW PAYMENT PLAN There has been an angry reaction among tax experts to a provision within the Finance Bill that will allow Customs and Excise to claim directly from banks overdue tax payments.

Unless councils have made provision for such transfers they will find that central government funding for repairs and improvements is reduced. An opposition Labour Party spokesman has noted that it would halt the scheme if it wins the next general election. -- SOUTH WEST FORCED TO CUT TRAINS AFTER DEAL ON DRIVERS It has been revealed that South West Trains, one of the first rail companies to be privatised, is having to reduce services after the company under-estimated the effects of its strategy of cutting the number of drivers employed. Having to cut up to 14 trains per day will come as something of an embarrassment to the Stagecoach group which had secured the franchise on a promise to improve services and may well send a warning to others in the sector. -- NATIONAL EXPRESS LEADS SCOTRAIL RACE It is reported that National Express is expected to be selected as the preferred bidder for ScotRail, opening the way for the company to take over the franchise for railway services in Scotland. The coach group has already secured three franchises in this field and an announcement confirming the success of its ScotRail bid is expected within two weeks. It is not anticipated that securing the deal, which has been beset by complications, will present any competition problems. -- NATWEST MARKETS POISED TO BUY HOUSING LOAN BOOK It is reported that NatWest Markets has emerged as the preferred bidder over three other rivals to take over the loans book of the Housing Corporation and Housing for Wales, worth in the region of one billion stg.

It is thought that the choice of NatWest Markets will be welcomed by the housing associations. -- WATER AND GAS COMPANIES FACE DATABASE CURBS It is believed that in the next few weeks the Data Protection Registrar will take steps to prevent utility companies making use of their electronic databases in order to target customers for offers of additional services.

GCAT	The United States on Tuesday rejected for the moment a U.N. proposal for a multi-national force to stem the crisis in Zaire. "We are not prepared right now to sign on to a multi-national force," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters.   Burns said U.S. officials would continue to discuss the multi-national force idea, put forward by Secretary-General Kofi Annan and backed by France. But he said Washington believed the political course being pursued at the moment was the right one. "We think that actually what's being done is the best way to help the refugees and to stop the fighting -- to pursue the ceasefire and to continue to encourage the United Nations to deliver this humanitarian assistance," he said, adding: "We do not believe there is a military solution to the problems of Zaire." Rebels have captured a swathe of eastern Zaire, driving Rwandan Hutu refugees before them, and now threaten the government stronghold of Kisangani. Burns said the State Department had authorised the voluntary departure of dependents of U.S. diplomats and other U.S. government employees in the Zairean capital, Kinshasa.

CCAT	SunPharm Corp's independent auditors have raised doubts over its ability to continue as a going concern, the company said in a regulatory filing. SunPharm is in the development stage with no significant revenues to date, auditors Deloitte & Touche LLC said in the company's annual report, which was filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Jacksonville, Fla., -based company will need additional financing in 1997 to complete a number of activities including 13 potential products in various stages of research and development.   Its recurring losses combined with "uncertainty surrounding the company's ability to obtain sufficient additional financing in 1997 raises substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern," the auditors said. SunPharm incurred costs of research and development totaling about $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, and about $7.57 million for the period from its inception on May 3, 1990, through December 31, 1996, the filing said. The company has incurred cumulative net losses of $11.6 million from its inception. As of December 31, 1996, the company had net operating losses of about $9.6 million. SunPharm develops small molecule pharmaceutical products, consisting of novel polyamine analogues and other proprietary compounds invented at the University of Florida.
CCAT	Seven years is a long hangover. But seven years after a 1990 collapse in asset prices saddled Japan's banking system with huge bad loans, many institutions are still struggling to get out from under and have done little to boost their global competitiveness, analysts say. Industry watchers believe authorities will honour their pledge not to let top banks fail, but they also warn that confidence in the ability of bankers and bureaucrats to cure financial system woes is flagging. Bank shares have slumped since late last year on worries about the health of the sector, and those fears grabbed the spotlight again this week after rumours -- flatly denied by the bank -- that Nippon Credit Bank Ltd was on the verge of collapse. Overseas funding costs for Japanese banks, the so-called Japan premium, have meanwhile risen in an echo of concerns in mid-1995, when Hyogo Bank Ltd became Japan's first bank to collapse in five decades. Ironically perhaps, investor patience is waning just as the government touts its commitment to planned five-year "Big Bang" financial reforms that would expose banks to harsher competition. "The perception of most foreigners has been that..the government and the bankers had decided to just wait it out and because that has worked in Japan in the past, I think that investors were also willing to give regulators and bankers the benefit of the doubt," Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia, told Reuters Financial Television. "I think what happened at the end of December was a realisation that very little has happened and very little is likely to happen," Ogawa said. "I suppose there is a beginning of a collapse in confidence in the ability of the private sector and the public sector to put things back together again." Analysts say stronger banks are making progress toward writing off their bad loan burdens, but some weaker brethren are facing difficulties. "The stronger banks are going in the right direction and the problem is basically manageable," said Koyo Ozeki, director of IBCA Ltd in Tokyo. "As regards some of the weaker banks, they have certain difficulties dealing with asset quality problems with their own financial resources in the short-term." Insufficient disclosure of the true state of affairs at individual banks, however, increases market jitters and can make it hard for banks and officials to kill rumours. "You know there are a lot of bad banks out there and you know there are potentially some braindead banks out there, but you don't really know precisely how bad it is and which banks are braindead," said Walter Altherr, senior banking analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities. "Most importantly, you have no idea what the government is going to do, if anything, about that." Analysts expect the government to keep its promise that none of the top 20 banks will be allowed to fail and that creditors and depositors will be protected, but don't know precisely how that pledge will be honoured. "The chance of any failure among any of the banks that are internationally active is absolutely out of the question. But that is not to say that some major banks are not in very serious trouble," Salomon's Ogawa said. "I would argue that one or two are technically insolvent. At the end of the day, something has to be done and that's part of the uncertainty now," she said, adding that one likely scenario was a merger with a stronger "white knight" bank. Handling the problem could also require using taxpayers' money, a political hot potato given public outrage last year over the use of 685 billion yen ($5.52 billion) from the national budget to help wind up failed mortgage firms. What bothers some analysts as much as the lingering bad loan problems of the past, however, is the failure of many Japanese banks to address the challenges of the future. "If you removed all the problem assets tomorrow, what would you be left with?" Ogawa said. "You'd be left with a financial system which is characterised by incredible levels of excess capacity, little or no capacity for innovation, a very low level of respect for shareholders, and low international competitiveness. What's so great about that?"
ECAT	Spanish Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato said on Thursday that the government was not worried by lower-than-expected fiscal revenue in 1996. He added that during January 1997, revenue rose six percent from the previous year. The Spanish government's revenues were totalled 1,210.0 billion pesetas ($8.5 billion) in December 1996 versus 1,277.8 in December 1995. Rato said government revenues were around 500 billion below the projected figures, partly due to lower-than-expected privatisation receipts.   In January 1996, revenues were 1,149.9 billion pesetas. Rato added that in 1997, Spanish debt will fall after having rose to 69.3 percent over gross domestic product in 1996 from around 65.3 percent in 1995. Rato was speaking to jornalists at a news conference on CPI data. -- Madrid Newsroom, + 341 585 8340

ECAT	Favorable economic trends will provide New Jersey with a $200 million budget cushion, raising the year-end surplus to $1.09 billion, according to the Office of Legislative Services. It said increased economic activity reflected in the new statistics should increase personal and corporate income tax revenues by $200 million when the budget year ends June 30. A revised report on revenues is due from the state Treasurer's office by April 1. Last week, the state Labor Department added to the good news with the release of February unemployment statistics showing a decrease to 5.5 percent, a six-year low. One cloud on the fiscal future for Gov. Christie Whitman is a bill working its way through the Legislature requiring felons to serve 85 percent of their prison sentences.

ECAT	China's first quarter gross domestic product rose 9.4 percent year on year, the State Statistical Bureau said on Friday. It said total GDP reached 1,468.6 billion yuan ($176 billion).   The State Statistical Bureau also said that industrial output during the first quarter rose 11 percent year on year to 452.5 billion yuan. China's economic growth is expected to top 10 percent this year after a solid 9.7 percent rise in 1996. Strong growth has been maintained while keeping inflation at relatively modest levels. The bureau earlier reported that in the first quarter its two key measures of inflation showed their lowest rises for the period since 1992. ($1 = 8.3 Yuan)
GCAT	The Taleban Islamic movement appealed on Tuesday for international recognition as the new government of Afghanistan and pledged not to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. Acting Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammed Stanakzai told a news conference that the Taleban militia, which seized Kabul from forces loyal to former president Burhanuddin Rabbani on Friday, had written to the United Nations claiming Afghanistan's seat there. He said the Taleban wanted good relations with neighbouring countries and with the United States and invited them to reopen their embassies in Kabul. It asked governments to "secure our embassies in their countries" to prevent members of the former government from "harming our national dignity". "All previous contracts and treaties will continue," Stanakzai said, adding that the Taleban opposed international terrorism. "We don't want to interfere in other countries' affairs or send people from here to create problems in other countries." The Taleban expected reciprocal treatment. The United States and its moderate allies in the Islamic world have long voiced concern about so-called Arab Afghans -- Arab Islamic radicals who came to fight the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s and who have since turned their military expertise against their own governments. Stanakzai, without specifying Arab militants, said the Taleban would punish any "terrorists" who fell into their hands. He said the Islamic militia had set up a six-man interim shura, or council, under Mullah Mohammed Rabbani, to govern Afghanistan until the military situation became clear. Later, the Taleban would invite representatives of the Afghan people from inside and outside the country to decide on a new form of government and rule on such questions as a possible role for former King Zahir Shah or for the Taleban's overall leader and founder Mullah Mohammed Omar. "We do not support or reject the king," he said. "Any time he wants to come to Afghanistan he is welcome. It is up to the people if they want to make him king, or president, or put him before a court." Stanakzai, speaking fluent English, said all Afghanistan's ethnic groups would play their part in the future administration, but only one member of the interim council was not from the Pashtun tribes from which the Taleban have so far drawn most of their support. For now, the priority was to drive forces led by ousted president Rabbani's military chief Ahmad Shah Masood out of their bastion in the Panjsher Valley, northeast of Kabul. "We hope it will be done very soon," he said. Stanakzai said the Taleban had no quarrel with Uzbek leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum, who controls about six northern provinces, and wanted to negotiate a peaceful solution with him. Before the fall of Kabul, the Taleban had not disguised their hatred for Dostum as a former communist. Their fighters now face his troops near the strategic Salang Tunnel, about 90 km (60 miles) north of Kabul. Stanakzai, 37, a graduate of the Kabul military acedemy, said that he, like many of his Taleban comrades, had fought with various mujahideen guerrilla groups against the Soviet occupation. He said interminable fighting among the mujahideen groups after the fall of the communist government in April 1992 had destroyed Afghanistan and dashed hopes for peace, reconstruction and rehabilitation. "So we picked up the arms used against the Russians and started disarming these people," he said of the birth of the Taleban movement.
CCAT	Sony Corp said on Friday it was in talks on joining Rupert Murdoch's Japanese satellite TV alliance, a move that analysts say would remake the electronics giant into an integrated multimedia company. They said Sony would also give Murdoch's new broadcast venture an edge over its two rivals in what promises to be a heated battle in the Japanese media market. "Sony has long been seeking a chance to create synergies between hardware and software," said Takatoshi Yamamoto, analyst at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd. "Satellite broadcasting is one of the few areas which allow Sony to integrate its businesses, such as content -- films, music and videogames -- studio-use broadcasting equipment and home-use set-top boxes," he said. Sony, an entertainment and consumer electronics giant, said it was in talks with media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's News Corp and Softbank Corp to invest in their jointly owned venture Japan Sky Broadcasting Co, or JSkyB. "It is true that we consider JSkyB a possible investment target and are continuing negotiations on this," Sony said in a statement, adding that no final decision had been made. A Softbank spokesman said the three are considering bringing Sony in as a shareholder in the venture as well as a content provider and a supplier of broadcasting equipment. Softbank Corp is a computer software and publishing firm. According to Nihon Keizai Shimbun reports on Friday, Sony hopes to take a one-third stake in JSkyB. Sony has tried repeatedly to venture into satellite broadcasting in Japan and the United States, in order to secure distribution routes for its films, music and game software, but failed to obtain licenses due to regulatory barriers. Sony, traditionally strong in broadcasting equipment technology and manufacturing, said earlier this week it would establish a new group company to pull together its broadcasting-related businesses. Satellite broadcasting has become the hottest sector for consumer electronics manufacturers. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co last year also approached Murdoch to discuss investments in JSkyB, an industry official said. Matsushita now owns a 15 percent stake in DirecTV, a company in the Hughes Electronics Corp group and a major rival of Murdoch's JSkyB. Sony's participation in JSkyB would give the group an edge over rival operators, analysts say, when Japan's three multichannel satellite broadcasters begin battling head-to-head for viewers this spring. JSkyB will start beaming 12 channels in April, increasing that number to 150 channels by April 1998. Rival PerfecTV, a venture led by a consortium of leading Japanese trade houses, launched its service in October 1996 and has already acquired more than 100,000 subscribers. It will expand the service to 100 channels this spring from 62 at present. And DirecTV, which brings together Matsushita, the powerful Mitsubishi conglomerate and Hughes, will start beaming 100 channels this autumn. "Sony is very good at dealing with content producers. With Sony's strong brand name, JSkyB will have an advantage over the others," said Tadashi Nishi, analyst at Sakura Institute of Research. JSkyB and PerfecTV have agreed to use the same receiver and are considered to have a head start over DirecTV in the race for subscribers. But some analysts believe the impact of Sony's participation in the race will be limited, as it is unlikely to stop supplying broadcasting content to JSkyB's rivals. "We don't think Sony's joining JSkyB would make it difficult for us to acquire content from Sony's entertainment units," said a spokesman at DirecTV.

ECAT	Mayors from Canada, Mexico and the United States will begin meeting on Wednesday outside the northern Mexican city of Monterrey at a conference intended to strengthen North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) trade ties, organizers said on Tuesday. Participants at the so-called First Summit of Mayors plan to sign an unspecified cooperative agreement, according to a statement.   Mayors sponsoring the event are from Kansas City, Missouri; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Dallas, Texas; Guadalajara, Jalisco; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and San Nicolas de los Garza, Nuevo Leon. Organizer Ulises de la Garza told Reuters that 83 mayors had confirmed their assistance. A total of more than 250 people had confirmed they would attend, including local government and chamber of commerce representatives. The conference will focus on increased technology and infrastructure investments, trade and economic development initiatives and cooperative trade marketing strategies, the statement said. Participants aim to set up a commission to coordinate efforts to reach the goals of the conference, organizers said. Other cities whose representatives that have confirmed attendance include: Witchita, Kansas; Des Moines, Iowa; Calgary, Alberta; Monterrey, Nuevo Leon; Saltillo, Coahuila; and Laredo, Tamaulipas.

MCAT	The Defense National Stockpile Center Friday issued a draft solicitation for bids on 32,000 long tons of rubber for sale in its first initial offering on January 8, 1997. The stockpile also said an industry meeting will be held at its headquarters on December 4 from 0900 EST/1400 GMT to 1130/1630 on the soliicitation, the contracting method selected, standard industry practices and overall market conditions. It said written comments are due by December 2.
MCAT	CSCE coffee futures posted losses for the third consecutive session Wednesday, battered by a steady dose of commission house and speculative selling, traders said. Benchmark December futures fell 2.00 cents per lb on the day, to 112.20, having traded from 116.25 to 111.75. Second-month March lost 1.65, to settle at 103.55. Today's downturn came despite a substantial drawdown in U.S. consumer stocks last month. The Green Coffee Associaton of New York reported Tuesday that supplies of green coffee housed in U.S. warehouses declined in September by 205,000 60-kg bags, to 1,611,000 bags. Most traders had expected GCA stocks to fall by 100,000 to 200,000 bags. "Everyone knows there is a tight supply of coffee," said Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes. "But this market has come up so much (that) a bit of a correction is to be expected. "The point is, if we had not trended higher the last two weeks, it may have responded to the GCA data," Ganes added." Nearby supply jitters carried the spot December contract to a six-week high of 116.30 cents on Friday -- up some 13 percent since the start of October -- and pushed out the December/March switch to a hefty 9.00 cents.   The nearby switch eased slightly Wednesday, ending at 8.65 cents compared to 9.00 cents at the close Tuesday. Dealers said the GCA figures did prompt a round of trade buying at the open, which carried the market to its intraday highs. But origin selling above 115.00 cents basis December quickly stemmed the gains and turned the momentum to the downside. Keen roaster interest was noted below the 112.50 level, but a late bout of local selling kept prices down, dealers said. Technically, traders said the December contract's ability to hold support at 111.50 cents today could be viewed as constructive. They put December's next downside target at 110.25. To the upside, strong resistance was noted at 118.50. On the fundamental side, traders continued to keep an eye on the trucker strike in Colombia, which entered its third day Wednesday. Exporters said the work stoppage has halted all shipments of coffee to Colombian ports. The day's turnover was relatively heavy, at an estimated 9,863 lots. --Patricia Avidan, New York Commodities Desk +1 212 859 1640
ECAT	Estonia's trade deficit rose to 1.6 billion kroons in March compared to 1.1 billion kroons the month before, the statistics office said on Monday. Estonia's exports were three billion kroons and imports 4.6 billion kroons in March, it added in a statement.   Exports rose by 7.1 percent and imports by 17.9 percent in March compared to February. The trade deficit with Russia increased from 61.6 million kroons in January to 373.8 million kroons in March. Estonia exported to 78 countries and imported from 106 countries, the office said. The European Union accounted for 51.3 percent and CIS countries for 20.9 percent of total exports. From total imports, the European Union had 56.2 percent and CIS countries 21.6 percent. The trade deficit was largest with Finland (573.9 million kroons) and the surplus the largest with Latvia (189.3 million kroons). -- Eva Palu, Tallinn Newsroom, +372 630 8400, reuters@reuters.ee
ECAT	South Carolina's gross state product grew 4.9 percent in the last year, more than twice the national rate of 2.3 percent, First Union economist Mark Vitner said Wednesday. He spoke at the Local Government Investment and Debt Training Conference sponsored by the state treasurer's office. Although the state economy is expected to slow in 1997, "We expect South Carolina to outperform the rest of the nation, with about a 4 percent growth rate," Vitner said. South Carolina would have done even better this year if not for the continuing downsizing at the Savannah River Plant and the layoffs at Charleston Naval Shipyard, he said. The state's private sector grew 6.2 percent for the year. Vitner said South Carolina's manufacturing sector continued to expand, although its growth rate slowed to about 2.3 percent in the past year because of declines in textiles and apparel. The state saw strong gains in machinery, transportation equipment and chemicals, partly because of export growth. Exports in manufactured goods rose 8.2 percent during the year. Tourism grew by 6.9 percent over last year. Regionally, Vitner said the Upstate, while bedeviled by 10 percent employment cuts in textiles and apparel, is expected to post 2.2 percent job growth this year. Columbia will come close, with growth of about 2 percent. Charleston will post growth of about 1 percent this year, as strong private sector growth has more than offset the shutdown of the Charleston Naval Base. Vitner said the strongest gains were in Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach, where job gains topped 5.2 percent due to tourism and migration from other states. Corporate relocations to South Carolina have also boosted the state economy, especially in Rock Hill, York County, Greenwood and Florence, he said. He predicted statewide holiday spending would rise by 8 percent over last year, with clothing accounting for a large part of purchases. He said computers and home electronics will do well, but their gains will trail prior years. --Jane Sutton, 305-374-5013

ECAT	Zimbabwe's year-on-year inflation rate dipped to a three-year low of just under 18 percent in August, surprising many economic analysts who were expecting it to track upward on a spate of price rises. August's year-on-year consumer price index (CPI) stood at 17.7 percent compared to 22 percent in July, largely due to a fall in food prices, the analysts said on Tuesday. "Food prices have a significant weighting on the total inflation basket, they comprise 29 percent of the total inflation basket," said private economic analyst Eric Bloch. "They (food prices) are substantially lower now -- between 35 and 40 percent -- from last year and that's the single biggest factor behind the fall in inflation in August," he told Reuters, Zimbabwe had a bumper harvest this year following last year's drought. However, other economists -- such as Farai Zizhou of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) and Edmore Tobaiwa of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce -- said they had not expected such a big fall in August inflation. "Even taking into account the weighting of food on the CPI basket, the fall in staple food prices was not that high to warrant such a decrease in inflation," said an analyst with a local commercial bank, adding: "I would have expected it to fall to not less than 20 percent," he added. The analyst, who asked not to be named, and Zizhou said they had expected annual inflation to rise in August and September due to increases in energy and milk prices announced in July. They said they would now have to revise their forecasts for inflation for the end of the year and for mid-1997. Central Reserve Bank Governor Leonard Tsumba has said he expected fuel price rises announced in July and recent wage hikes in the private and public sectors to push inflation to between 23 and 24 percent in the next two months before easing to 20 percent by December. Civil servants won large pay rises recently by bringing the country to a near standstill through widespread strikes. "Depending on fiscal performance and, of course, on the 1996/97 rainy season, inflation should decline further to about 17 percent by the end of June 1997," Tsumbe said this month. He and other Reserve Bank officials were unavailable for comment on the latest inflation statistics. Stock brokers and analysts said on Tuesday this latest fall in annual inflation should bolster sentiment on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, which has been on a heady bull-run on prospects of lower interest rates and further investment incentives for the exchange. "The fall in inflation which fuels hopes for cuts in interest rates makes the stock exchange a much more attractive home for investment as opposed to the money market because the returns there will be lower," said a broker. ----Harare Newsroom: +263-4 72 52 27/8/9----
ECAT	Ireland's adjusted annual private sector credit growth rose to 19 percent in April from 18.6 percent the previous month, the central bank said on Thursday.   The adjusted rate of growth of the broad money supply, M3E, rose to 17.3 percent from 16.2 percent. "The money and credit developments in April occurred against the background of foreign exchange market developments during the month which are likely to have added to credit growth," the central bank said in a statement. It said non-mortgage Irish-pound credit was 22 percent higher at end-April than a year earlier, compared with a 20.7 percent increase in the year to March. The annual rate of increase in residential mortgage lending remained unchanged at 14.3 percent.   Central bank monthly statistics showed private sector credit rose by 961 million Irish pounds or 2.6 percent. Around one third of the increase was due to lending to companies in Dublin's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). Of the remainder, 518 million was in Irish pounds and 138 million was foreign-currency denominated. Mortgage lending accounted for 175 million of the increase in Irish-pound credit in April. Short-term notes and bills, and term and revolving loans each contributed around 130 million. -- Dublin Newsroom +353 1 676 9779
ECAT	New orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly during July, the Commerce Department said Friday, with widespread gains across most major categories. Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $317.6 billion, significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists. That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders. Shipments of finished products and order backlogs also increased from June, suggesting firm underlying strength in the economy's industrial sector as the second half began. Orders for costly durable goods like new cars, refrigerators and other items intended to last three years or more rose a revised 1.7 percent in July to $172.9 billion after a 0.2 percent fall in June. Previously the department said June factory orders had fallen more sharply, by 0.9 percent, but it revised that to a 0.7 percent decline. Strong July factory orders reinforced other signs that the economy entered the final six months of the year with considerable momentum. In a separate report, the department said consumer spending barely edged up in July, as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months. Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June. Incomes from wages, salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June. The department had previously reported a 1.6 percent rise in July durables orders, but it revised that up slightly. Orders for non-durables like food and paper products --items that are used up more quickly -- also picked up strongly in July, by 1.8 percent to $144.7 billion following a 1.2 percent decrease in June. Among durable products, the only category that showed a decline in July from June was transportation equipment, down 0.4 percent to $41.6 billion after a 1.3 percent June drop. But that was mainly because of a falloff in demand for military ships and tanks that offset a pickup in orders for new cars. Shipments of motor vehicles and parts grew by 5.4 percent in July after a 1.2 percent fall in June. In the automobile industry, shipments correspond to orders. Excluding transportation, factory orders were up 2.1 percent in July after easing in June by 0.6 percent. The biggest increase in July came in orders for electrical and electronic equipment, up 4.7 percent to $28 billion after a 3.8 percent June increase. Industrial machinery orders gained 2.9 percent to $32.6 billion following a 0.3 percent June rise. Total shipments of manufactured goods, which reflect more immediate demand than orders, increased by 1.2 percent in July to $312.7 billion after a 0.8 percent fall in June. Unfilled orders increased by 1 percent to $504.1 billion after a 0.7 percent June increase. It was the tenth increase in order backlogs in the past 11 months, indicating likely strength in manufacturing industries in coming months. Orders for non-defence capital goods, a measure of business' expansion plans, rose 0.6 percent in July after falling 0.1 percent in June. Excluding aircraft, non-defence capital goods were up by 1 percent last month after a 1 percent June drop.
GCAT	A Quebec Superior Court ruled on Friday that lawyer Guy Bertrand can continue with his court battle against referendums that would lead to a unilateral declaration of independence by Quebec. In his ruling, Justice Robert Pidgeon allowed Bertrand to proceed to a full hearing of his application for an injunction against future sovereignty referendums that would allow Quebec to secede unilaterally. The separatist Parti Quebecois government had tried to block Bertrand's application, arguing that the courts had no place in deciding what should be a purely political matter.   "Certain of the constitutional questions raised by (Bertrand) deserve to be looked at fully by a judge," Pidgeon wrote in French in his 62-page decision. Pidgeon said many of Bertrand's arguments were hypothetical, but it will be up to the judge who hears the injunction application to decide whether the lawyer's constitutional rights are being threatened by the Quebec government's independence drive. Bertrand's application for an injunction should be given a full hearing to address four important questions relating to Quebec's sovereignty plan, Pidgeon said.   Those are: Whether the right to self-determination is synonymous with the right to secession. Whether Quebec can unilaterally secede from Canada. Whether the process of Quebec's accession to sovereignty is permissible under international law, and whether international law has precedence over a country's domestic laws in such situations. In court hearings last spring, Bertrand, a flambuoyant former Quebec hardline separatist turned ardent federalist, charged that referendums leading to Quebec's unilateral declaration of independence would amount to an attempted "coup d'etat."   Canadian and Quebec government officials were expected to comment later Friday on the judge's decision. The Quebec government will have to decide whether to appeal Friday's judgment. The Bertrand case has created problems for Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard's government and forced the Canadian government to take a legal position on any move by Quebec to unilaterally secede from Canada should it garner a majority vote in a referendum on sovereignty. Last October, Quebec separatists lost a referendum on sovereignty by one percentage point. -- Reuters Montreal bureau (514) 985-2434

MCAT	Polish shares rose for the fourth session running and analysts said Thursday's 2.7-percent jump in higher trade with strong buying after fixing signalled that large investors were taking advantage of relatively low prices. "It seems that after the several-week fall on our bourse prices had become attractive for investors with lots of capital," said Dariusz Szepieniec of Bank Slaski brokgerage. Banks, which had underperformed the lacklustre overall market this year amid worsening earnings reports, led Thursday's rebound with large-cap Bank Slaski and BPH up nearly 10 percent in active trade. Small-cap Amerbank surged 9.9 percent and large-cap BRE rose five percent in active trade. The main market's all-share WIG index rose 2.7 percent to 15,930.4 points and turnover rose 12.1 percent to 205.3 million zlotys ($58.5 million) on both markets. Gainers led losers by 64 to 22 with 23 stocks flat. Analysts said some investors might be shifting funds from neighbouring bourses such as Budapest which hit recent highs while Polish shares had suffered due to macroeconomic concerns and the recent flooding. On Monday, official interest rates rose to cool domestic demand and help cap the widening current account deficit. Analysts said the bourse may have put the effects of the rate rise behind it but warned that more rapid growth could lead to a downward correction early next week. They said 16,500 points could provide resistance, with some investors still likely to refrain from buying before the September 21 parliamentary elections.

CCAT	The "millennium bug" that has the potential to stop computers in their tracks in the year 2000 is a manageable problem provided people get an early start, commit adequate resources and leave time for testing, several speakers at a conference sponsored by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) said Friday. Rerepresentatives from the banking, thrift and data processing industries and from government repeatedly stressed the dangers of not being prepared. But a few mentioned that obvious beneficiaries of the herculean effort would be programmers who have the training to update old computer code.   Denis O'Leary, executive vice president and chief information officer of Chase Manhttan Corp, said the industry was entering a "raging bull market" for people with information technology skills. "The problem will get increasingly acute over the next five years," he said. During a break in the proceedings, one of the conference participants suggested salaries for people capable of managing year 2000 projects could double as some companies that are behind the curve get desperate.   Chris Carrington, vice president at Electronic Data Systems Corp, said companies not up to handling the task in-house will increasingly turn to outside services. "Demand for year 2000 services will clearly outstrip the supply," he said. "People will be standing at the altar with no one to marry, probably starting in 1998." He said EDS has already turned down some business. He said one frustrated head of a financial services firm told him EDS was the third company to tell him they did not want the job.   John Tenuta, a senior vice president at Fiserv Inc, said one benefit was the opportunity to discard obsolete programs as companies go through their entire list of software. But the emphasis at the conference was clearly on warnings of dangers. Willie Kennedy Jr, senior project manager for the year 2000 at KeyCorp's Key Services, said making sure that outside vendors are supplying "year 2000 compliant" systems is of critical importance. "The bottom line is that if it is not year 2000 compliant it will not come into Key Bank," he said.   He said lawyers have been involved in writing contracts to make sure that guarantees from suppliers are enforceable. Carrington noted that there are programming tools on the market to make the job of conversions easier, but he said "no tool is 100 percent perfect" and he added that "we've found a couple that don't work." He declined to name any products. Sally Katzen, administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), said the cost to the U.S. government to fix its own systems could top $3.0 billion, up from estimates of $2.3 billion several months ago.   She said the U.S. government not only has to get its own systems ready but federal regulatory agencies responsible for transportaton and medicine must make sure private business is ready. Katzen said one area of concern has been pacemakers, the tiny devices that regulate the heartbeat. "We have been assured that they will keep functioning," she said. Stephen Hagen, legislative fellow from the Senate Banking Committee, said the emphasis in Congress has been on "oversight" rather than passing laws to deal with 2000. He said one concern among lawmakers is whether all the work on year 2000 will delay or impede other technology initiatives unrelated to the year 2000 date problem. Robert Albanese, OTS regional director, told the conference his office is going to be stepping up the pace of its scrutiny. He said all of the regional directors of the OTS were sending letters Friday to institutions they supervise with new details of plans to make sure the industry gets the job done in time.

GCAT	The House of Representatives is expected to consider on Thursday a resolution to disapprove certification of Mexico as an ally in the war against drugs, House Majority Leader Dick Armey said. Republicans want to "encourage the development of commerce" in Mexico, but "we also want to make it very clear that we cannot have laxity in drug enforcement," Armey said on Tuesday. The House International Relations committee approved the resolution last week that would disapprove President Clinton's certification that Mexico is cooperating fully with the United States in the anti-drug war. "I believe if the legislation were put on the floor as it came out of the committee it would pass ... overwhelmingly," Armey told reporters. "My own desire is to find that magic language that demonstrates to the Mexican government how serious we are about the need for this kind of enforcement, but does not result in behavioral actions by the international financial community that jeopardizes the Mexican economy," Armey, a Texas Republican, said.
ECAT	Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Wednesday that the full cabinet would discuss a finance ministry plan to cut 1996 spending by 9.3 billion crowns in order to end the year with a balanced budget.   Klaus said a meeting of economic ministers on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to the plan. "On the basis of this coalition meeting, this proposal of the finance minister will be placed on the government agenda next Wednesday," Klaus told Reuters after a cabinet meeting. "You quoted a sum 9.3 billion (crowns of spending cuts), and I didn't doubt it. From that, you can deduce (it will be) rougly that sum," he said, responding to a question about the amount. Finance ministry sources have said a preliminary plan calls for the spending cuts to be taken evenly across all ministries in order to meet the balanced budget.   The major culprit in a more than six billion crown shortfall in projected 1996 revenue is apparently Russia, which has failed to pay roughly five billion crowns in credit owed to the Czech Republic this year. Another problem was the higher-than-expected expenditures on heating subsidies to households because of the unusually long and cold winter. -- Jan Lopatka, Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003
GCAT	Thousands of volunteers pitched in Monday to help residents haul away debris and rinse off layers of mud left by a week of devastating flooding along the Ohio River. "It's been fantastic. We've had church groups and children's homes help us out," said Sharon Thompson, a Red Cross centre manager in Radcliffe, Ky., 30 miles southwest of Louisville. In Metropolis, Ill., 150 miles downstream, townspeople have laboured for days towing trailer homes to higher ground and stacking sandbags ahead of Friday's anticipated crest of the Ohio River. "The people in Metropolis have really pitched in and helped their neighbours," said Bill Kommer, mayor of the city of 8,000 across from Paducah, Ky. "We've got a lot of volunteers. We've got inmates from a (prison) boot camp helping fill sandbags." "So far, our biggest problem is sightseers," he said. "They'll go around a barricade, and where the water is up on a house, the cars cause waves that lap up in basements and ruin furnaces." Kommer said the river was expected to rise another foot until Friday's crest and threatened to engulf the sewage treatment plant and whole city blocks. The Players riverboat casino was already closed and 35 families were staying with friends because their relocated trailers lacked electricity. Meanwhile, the river crested upstream at Owensboro, Ky., backing up water from the overflowing Green River that has turned three-quarters of McLean County into a murky lake. "It could stay that way for a couple of more days until the Ohio River recedes," said Dan Bundy of the Kentucky Disaster and Emergency Services division. Residents of hard-hit Falmouth, Ky., New Richmond, Ohio, Aurora, Ind., and scores of other communities caught up in the area's worst flooding since 1964 were glad for the outpouring of charity. "Though it has brought a flood of destruction, it has also brought a flood of compassion," said Rev. Wayne Mock in New Richmond. Around Indianapolis, volunteers collected donated clothing and food to distribute to tens of thousands of flood victims spread along the river and its tributaries in Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia. Others piled up ruined dry wall, carpeting, appliances and other possessions outside flooded homes to be trucked away. Chefs from a contingent of National Guard troops cooked for the two dozen residents of West Point unable to make it back into their water-logged town. A total of 118 homes in West Point were completely destroyed and 95 suffered major damage, authorities said. As most of the flood evacuees returned to their homes, Red Cross centres dismantled cots and set up desks to process applications for disaster assistance. A drowning victim was found Sunday among debris along the Licking River near Falmouth, raising to five the number of deaths attributed to the rampaging river that destroyed 80 percent of the town of 2,300. On Monday, officials combed the swollen Ohio River Monday near Stanley, Ky., for two people missing since a canoe accident Sunday. A third person was rescued. Overall, at least 59 deaths were blamed on tornadoes and flash floods that hit eight states the first weekend in March. Max Goldberg, the 83-year-old mayor of Falmouth, was making a rapid recovery from an apparent heart attack he suffered Saturday. Friends said Goldberg envisioned a rebirth of the town as a model 19th Century frontier settlement -- to be built on higher ground. This month's heavy rainfall provided slightly better news from the Tennessee Valley Authority, which operates a series of reservoirs and hydropower dams on the western end of the Ohio River Valley. Spokesman Gil Francis said there was enough watery fuel to churn out millions of kilowatts of cheap power.
CCAT	Electrafina, a holding company controlled by Belgian financier Albert Frere, has bought a 3.05 percent stake in French Compagnie de Suez from Banque Nationale de Paris boosting its Suez stake to 11.35 percent. "The increase of our stake in Suez, made in full agreement with the Suez chairman,...anticipates notably on the dilutive effect (on our Suez) stake of the planned merger between Suez and (French utilities group) Lyonnaise des Eaux," Electrafina said in a statement on Friday. Electrafina is a unit of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA (GBL), the flagship holding company of the reclusive Belgian financier. "Our strategy is not to take control of Suez, but to accompany its chairman's strategy," Electrafina said. Electrafina already had an 8.3 percent capital stake in Suez. The purchase boosted its stake in Suez to 11.35 percent, but as some French shares have double voting rights, GBL's voting share in Suez is only just over 10 percent, a GBL official told Reuters. The statement also said that the nomination of an Electrafina representative on the Suez board will be proposed at the next meeting of Suez shareholders. -- Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6810, Fax +32 2 230 7710

GCAT	Britain is confident the European Union can reach agreement on further integration at a crucial summit next month but plenty of work remains to be done first, officials said on Thursday. The new Labour government has distanced itself from threats by the previous Conservative administration to veto the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) summit in Amsterdam unless the EU makes a number of concessions. "The Foreign Secretary thinks a deal at Amsterdam is possible -- there is a clear willingness in France and Germany to start talks," said an official. He was speaking a day after new foreign minister Robin Cook visited France and Germany to assure Britain's main EU partners that the government wanted to end the antagonism which marked the end of Conservative rule. The new administration has been quick to show a more positive face towards its European partners, while stressing it will be no pushover in negotiations. Officials said Britain especially wanted to see progress on the problem of "quota-hopping" -- the practice whereby foreign fishermen buy British boats to gain greater access to EU catch quotas. "Ministers need to look at quota-hopping and develop an approach. It's an extremely important issue for them," an official told reporters. "The government is avoiding talk of vetoing the IGC but has made clear there must be real progress on this issue between now and Amsterdam." British fishermen say quota-hoppers -- mainly from the Netherlands and Spain -- are driving them out of business. "I don't think there's any lack of understanding in France and Germany. The problem is the inflexible attitude of Spain. We need to be making progress before the IGC," the official said. Both the French and German ministers for Europe planned to visit London within the next two weeks for talks, he added. Jacques Santer, president of the EU's executive  commission, said in an article published on Thursday that Britain could be at a turning point in its relations with the EU. "This is what many friends of Britain want. That is not to say they expect the new government to compromise on its defence of Britain's vital interests," he added. Santer said the EU faced an exciting future and urged Britain to play a key role in it. He laid out the arguments in favour of a single European currency, due to be launched in 1999, but stopped short of arm-twisting Britain over European monetary union (EMU). "This EMU is not for turning," he said. "I am sure Britain will weigh all the arguments when the time comes and I hope the City of London and others will be fully prepared for EMU if Britain does decide to join." Labour has said it is unlikely Britain will join the single currency in the first wave, due to begin in 1999.
GCAT	Pakistan's political parties were allotted symbols on Sunday to help people vote in next February's election -- with the two frontrunners drawing the emblems of an arrow and a tiger. The symbol of an arrow went to ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) while the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) party of her main rival, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, was given the tiger. A total of 49 parties will take part in the February 3 election -- being held after Bhutto's three-year-old government was sacked and the lower house of parliament dissolved last November. But political observers say the election will be a straight fight between the PPP and PML. Symbols to identify political parties easily are vital in Pakistan's elections because only about 30 percent of the population of 130 million can read and write. Most voters, from the isolated valleys of the Hindukush mountains in the north to the bullet-scarred slums of the volatile port city of Karachi in the south, will simply place a mark beside the symbol of their choice. Bhutto, whose government was sacked by President Farooq Leghari on disputed charges of corruption and misrule, has challenged her dismissal before the Supreme Court. The court has promised to give its ruling before the elections. In 1993, the Supreme Court overturned a similar dismissal of Sharif as prime minister by then president Ghulam Ishaq Khan. Formally filing her candidature on Saturday in her home town of Larkana, Bhutto told reporters she was confident she would be similarly returned to power. Sharif filed his candidature in his home city of Lahore, capital of the populous Punjab province. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, has refused to contest the election after being detained following the ouster of his wife's government, in which he was investment minister. Zardari was re-arrested on Thursday in connection with the alleged murder of Bhutto's estranged brother, Murtaza Bhutto, in September after being released from a Karachi jail. Murtaza's Lebanese-born widow, Ghinwa, who heads a breakaway PPP faction of her husband, has filed her candidature in another consituency from Larkana district to fight her mother-in-law, Nusrat Bhutto. The main contest will be for 207 Moslem seats in the 217-seat National Assembly, while Christians and other minorities will dispute 10 seats in separate lists.
GCAT	A war of words has broken out between the United States and Jamaica over the alleged boarding of a Jamaican fishing vessel by U.S. and British sailors as part of the U.S. drug war in the Caribbean. A strongly worded U.S. Embassy statement on Tuesday night accused the Kingston government of behaving in a provocative way over the incident and virtually accused it of lying. The dispute was the latest between the two countries over how the United States wages the drug war in Caribbean waters. Jamaica said the fishing boat Silver Dollar was stopped by the British Royal Navy ship Liverpool last month and boarded by British and U.S. personnel who reportedly searched the vessel but found nothing incriminating. It said on June 27 that it had called in the U.S. and British ambassadors to demand an apology. It said the search took place in Jamaican territorial waters without government permission and it would seek compensation for the fishermen. The U.S. Embassy denied a search had taken place. "At no point was the Silver Dollar detained or directed to stop ... at no point did British or U.S. personnel attempt to board or search the fishing vessel," it said. U.S. Ambassador J. Gary Cooper did not meet Jamaica's Foreign Minister Seymour Mullings until Tuesday, the embassy said. It said the Foreign Ministry's attitude to the incident was "provocative" and accused Kingston of listening only to the fishermen's side of the story. "We have exercised considerable restraint in regard to public actions by the Jamaican government. This includes the issuance of a provocative press release containing factual errors ... and repeated references to a meeting with ambassador Cooper that never took place," the embassy said. The dispute appeared to bring U.S.-Jamaican relations to a new low following a disagreement last year over Kingston's refusal to sign an accord that would allow U.S. drug enforcement agents to detain and search vessels in Jamaica's waters and airspace -- the so-called Ship Rider accords. A senior U.S. State Department official threatened Jamaica with decertification as a drug war ally and claimed to have knowledge of a Jamaican political figure with strong links to drug traffickers. The statement was later retracted. Kingston and Washington agreed on a final text this year but the accord has yet to come into force. Washington is concerned that Colombian cocaine and heroin traffickers have opened up new smuggling routes to the United States through the islands and sea lanes of the Caribbean.
ECAT	China will boost supervision of foreign currency payments on imports to try to stop the flow of foreign exchange from the current account to the capital account, the Xinhua news agency said on Monday. Under the new rules, effective March 1, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange will take over from designated state banks verification of foreign exchange payments on imports, Xinhua quoted administration director Zhou Xiaochuan, as saying. Zhou said the regulations would help ensure authenticity of payments and help iron out problems encountered in making the yuan convertible under the current account. China made the yuan convertible under the current account on December 1. "The new law will standardise the payments for imports by importers and the designated banks, and it will also prevent the transfer of foreign exchange from the current account to the capital account," Zhou said. He said such transfers could disturb the financial market, but did not elaborate. But he said the rules would have a postive effect on the foreign trade sector. He expected imports and exports this year to be basically balanced, and the yuan to remain stable. Zhou said China will launch this year a comprehensive statistical study of international incomes and payments and try to strengthen regulation of foreign exchange supply and demand under the capital account. Beijing also aimed to standardise and develop the interbank foreign exchange market and maintain a stable foreign exchange market, he said. ($1 = 8.3 yuan) -- Beijing Newsroom (8610) 6532-1921
MCAT	Swedish shares ended lower on Wednesday after coming off mornings highs on international worries ahead of the second round of French elections. The bourse's general index fell 0.39 percent to 2,840.10 in turnover of 5.4 billion crowns. "It's the French election that's casting a shadow on interest rates and the bourse," a dealer said. "Unfortunately it will probably remain this way the rest of the week." Automotive group Volvo and fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz belonged to the few winners. Volvo rose two crowns to 216, partly lifted by saying its global truck order intake rose 32 percent in the first four months of the year. H&M jumped seven crowns to 260. Engineer Atlas Copco dropped eight crowns to 211. "Atlas Copco took a beating...its recent upturn feels unfounded," one broker said. Insurer Skandia fell one crown to 275 in continued profit taking. The share dived 17 crowns on Tuesday after surging 42 crowns in the previous two sessions as analysts upgraded the company's unit linked unit AFS. Heavyweights drugs major Astra and telecoms group Ericsson both fell. Astra slid 1.5 crowns to 129 and Ericsson slipped 0.5 to 274.

GCAT	Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov struck twice in the second half to help Barcelona to a 4-2 win over Oviedo on the first weekend of the Spanish championship on Sunday. Champions Atletico Madrid began their title defence with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Celta Vigo. Stoichkov scored twice early after the interval but the home side fought back to take advantage of mistakes in the Barcelona back four before two late headed goals by Luis Enrique Martinez guaranteed Bobby Robson's men their three points. Former Barcelona striker Romario also scored on his return to Spain but Valencia squandered a 2-0 lead at Racing Santander to go down 3-2 after seeing international goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta sent off for handling the ball outside the area. Atletico played what should have been a home fixture in the Santiago Bernabeu stadium of arch-rivals Real Madrid because of pitch problems at their own ground. Former Real forward Juan Eduardo Esnaider obviously found the move to his liking and the Argentine international opened the scoring with a fine goal early in the second half. Kiko Narvaez made it two shortly afterwards with a spectacular effort. Celta played most of the game with 10 men after Chemo del Solar was sent off for handllng a shot by Jose Luis Caminero in the 15th minute. Serbian set-piece specialist Milinko Pantic was unable to convert the penalty. Former Ajax midfielder George Finidi scored on his home debut for Real Betis who recorded an impressive 3-0 win over Athletic Bilbao, while first-division newcomers Extremedura scored their first goal ever in the top flight, only to go down 2-1 at Hercules. Real Sociedad beat Sevilla 1-0 and Zaragoza surrendered a 2-0 lead to Logrones, who fought back to draw 2-2. On Saturday Real Madrid disappointed their fans and new manager Fabio Capello with a scrappy 1-1 draw at Deportivo Coruna.   Tenerife shocked last year's surprise outfit Compostela with a 6-0 drubbing that makes them the first leaders of this year's championship ahead of Monday night's game between Espanyol and Sporting Gijon. Compostela ended the game with just eight men while six different Tenerife players found the target.

ECAT	A giant leap in corporation tax receipts during October has given the British government the leeway it needs to cut government borrowing in next week's budget, economists polled by Reuters said. According to a survey of 27 London-based economists, Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke is likely to slice one billion sterling off his forecast for this year's public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) to 26 billion and lop two billion off the previous target of 23 billion for 1997/98 when he announces his budget on Tuesday. Figures for October, which were released on Monday, showed a net repayment of 4.4 billion sterling back into government coffers, taking PSBR for the fiscal year so far to 11.4 billion sterling. "Those numbers will give the government an excuse to knock this year's forecast down by a billion," said Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan. The record tax receipts have provided Clarke with extra ammunition to cut taxes next Tuesday, with the Reuters survey predicting a net tax giveaway of around 2.25 billion sterling. "Before Monday's numbers there had been a risk that PSBR might reach 30 billion this year. The debt repayment in October takes that prospect away," said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Union Discount. "If Clarke cuts his PSBR forecast for next year, he can say he has managed to cut personal taxation and reduce PSBR for the coming year as well," he added. Economists agree the budget deficit is on a downward path, with the strengthening British economy swelling corporation tax revenue and reducing social security benefit payments. And while most agree the chancellor will meet the current forecast for this year of 27 billion, they are sceptical of his chances of undershooting the target. "The PSBR is on a downward path...it's just that its progress isn't as fast as it should be for this stage of the economic cycle," said Trevor Williams, economic adviser at Lloyds TSB. "The fiscal stance is undeniably being tightened but it is not being tightened enough, given the fact that there will be so many boosts to consumer spending next year," he added. -- Karen Iley, London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7958

GCAT	Steve Redgrave has reversed his decision to quit rowing and has set his sights on an unprecedented fifth gold medal at the Sydney Olympics. "If anyone sees me near a boat they can shoot me, " he had vowed after clinching victory with partner Matthew Pinsent in the coxless pairs in Atlanta. But at a news conference on Thursday Redgrave admitted that the pull of competition and the chance to strike gold at five successive Games had proved too great (Corrects to delete reference to Redgrave becoming the first Olympic competitor to win gold medals at five successive Games.) "My heart really lies with the competition," said Redgrave who plans to form a four with Pinsent. "Both Matthew and I did not really want to carry on as a pair as we have done for the past six years. "If I had to put it put it down to anything it was the desire to go to another Olympics. I still feel I am young enough to carry on." He said he had declined several very tempting coaching offers during his four months hiatus from the sport. While the thought of further Olympic glory is Redgrave's biggest spur, he and Pinsent -- Britain's only gold medallists in Atlanta -- have also received a huge financial carrot. A finance firm will back the pair in a one million pound ($1.6 million) deal over the next four years, the biggest sponsorship in the history of British rowing.
GCAT	Forces loyal to Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen appeared to be in complete control of the capital Phnom Penh and its outskirts on Monday after rival troops abandoned their stronghold west of the city. After two days of fighting, troops backing First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh pulled out of Tang Krasang base near Phnom Penh's international airport, a Cambodian military intelligence official said. "Today CPP took control, beginning this morning," said the senior military intelligence official loyal to Ranariddh, referring to Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party. Another Ranariddh loyalist, senior commander General Tom Sombol, confirmed the base had been abandoned. "Everything is over," he said. It was not immediately clear where Ranariddh's men had withdrawn to, but they abandoned the base overnight, Tom Sombol said. The city was calm but tense on Monday after the overnight curfew ended, although troops were seen looting the nearby airport, about 10 km (six miles) west of Phnom Penh. Hun Sen's forces had previously cut off all access to the airport, witnesses said. All flights in and out of Phnom Penh have been cancelled since the weekend. At least 12 people were killed and 50 wounded in the weekend's fighting on the streets of the capital. Hun Sen's forces captured the headquarters of Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and his city centre residence in heavy fighting on Sunday. A government official said Ranariddh's top military man, General Nhiek Bun Chhay, had pulled out of the base overnight with a wounded leg. Forces loyal to Hun Sen were searching for him and his men, the official said. From Beijing, Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk appealed for an immediate end to the fighting, saying the warring prime ministers should hurry to visit him in Beijing to hammer out a solution. "Please stop fighting right away without any preconditions," Sihanouk said in a statement issued from his residence in Beijing. Sihanouk issued his appeal as thousands of people fled Phnom Penh or were loading up possessions to leave. Ranariddh accused Hun Sen of launching a coup, but a radio station loyal to the People's Party leader denied the charge, saying if that were so Ranariddh's ministers and officials would have been arrested. Ranariddh was believed to be in France. The two prime ministers head a fractured coalition government formed amid the threat of civil war after a United Nations-run election in 1993. As Cambodia's monarch, Sihanouk has little political power but is considered to retain wide popularity in the war-torn Southeast Asian nation. He has spent extended periods in Beijing since being deposed from power by a U.S.-backed 1970 coup and in recent years has frequently returned to the Chinese capital for medical treatment. Cambodia's membership of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) meanwhile was still on schedule for next month, Malaysia's Acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Monday.
CCAT	Poland may suspend daytime traffic of heavy goods vehicles as of August 24, to prevent them causing road damage when expected high temperatures soften asphalt, transport authorities said on Tuesday. "The ban would concern vehicles heavier than 12 tonnes between 11.00 a.m. (0900 GMT) and 11.00 p.m. (2100 GMT)," Karol Filipek, an official of the General Management of Public Roads (GDDP), said.

GCAT	Iraq said on Saturday it had fired missiles at U.S. planes policing no-fly zones -- but missed -- while a newspaper run by President Saddam Hussein's son called for a holy war against the United States. In northern Iraq, Kurdish villagers abandoned their homes ahead of an expected incursion by Turkey's military massing on the border, and Kurdish rebels prepared for further attacks by the combined forces of Iraqi troops and a rival Kurdish faction. "Iraqi air defence men have confronted the hostile (American) aircraft by firing surface-to-air missiles," Iraqi state television said quoting a defence ministry spokesman. It did not say when the missiles were fired. "We have no alternative...but to declare Jihad (holy war) and fight them until the last drop in Iraqis' veins...and strongly reject all their means and commandments," declared Babel, the newspaper of Saddam's eldest son Uday, in a front-page editorial. "We denounce all their latitudes and longitudes. Death is better for us all if our country's territory, waters and people are not united," Babel said, referring to no-fly zones imposed by Washington and its allies over the north and south of Iraq. The Pentagon said that 44 cruise missile strikes, mounted in response to Iraq's military assault against Kurdish rebels in the north last weekend, severely damaged Iraqi air defences in the south last Tuesday and Wednesday, destroying or damaging up to 11 of 15 targets. The United States also expanded the southern no-fly zone from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd, bringing it close to the outskirts of Baghdad. The government newspaper al-Jumhouriya ridiculed U.S. claims that its missile raids had helped reverse the situation in northern Iraq and the main Kurdish city of Arbil, which the Iraqis captured for a pro-Baghdad Kurdish faction last Saturday. "Iraq once again proves that it is the decisive force in Iraqi Kurdistan...the liberation of Arbil marks (the beginning) of the great collapse in U.S. plans against it," the daily said. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), ousted from Arbil last week, said the rival Iraqi-backed Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) had attacked positions in five villages around Halabja, 10 km (six miles) from the Iranian border. The PUK said KDP and Iraqi forces had started to advance from Arbil along the north route towards the PUK stronghold of Sulaimaniya via Degala and the key town of Koi Sanjaq. Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said Turkey might clear some settlements from a narrow "buffer zone" it plans to create along its mountainous and porous border with northern Iraq to prevent infiltrations by separatist Turkish Kurdish rebels using bases there for its 12-year-old insurgency in southeast Turkey. The rebellion has cost over 20,000 lives. Turkish troops have been massing on the border with Iraq in apparent readiness to push against the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), but army officials would not comment on reports that troops had already mounted some cross-border attacks. A foreign ministry official said Ankara wanted to empty some border settlements to ensure civilians were not caught up in fighting and were unable to give refuge or support to the PKK. He did not give any details of the planned operation. Iraqi Kurdish villagers in the border region were already on the move however. Scores of refugees evacuated the area around Banek, about 30 km (20 miles) from the main Iraqi border town of Zakho. They shuttled their belongings to a valley further south, leaving behind fruit and vegetable harvests. "Every year the Turks raid our village. They cut down our fruit trees and bomb our houses, killing our livestock," said Khane Seini, 70, carrying personal belongings on her back. Ciller defended the planned security cordon. "Turkey is determined to protect its own borders," state-run Anatolian news agency quoted her as saying. "This thing called a cordon really constitutes measures just across our border, which are going to prevent entry into our borders." She said any measures would be taken in consultation with Turkey's neighbours and allies. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in London the United States understood Turkey's reasons for establishing a security zone in Iraq and had been assured it would be temporary and involve no permanent troops. But France, Russia and neighbour Syria have opposed the Turkish plan. Iraq has rejected it as "unacceptable." European Union foreign ministers meeting in Tralee, Ireland, glossed over their differences about the U.S. attacks on Iraq. But in opposition to Washington, the ministers called for a reinstatement of the United Nations' oil-for-food deal for Baghdad, suspended last week after Saddam's attacks on the PUK. The ministers emerged from what some EU diplomats said was a tense four-hour meeting, having agreed on a number of points concerning Iraq, but unable to find a common position for the whole 15-nation bloc. Although no formal statement was issued, EU president Ireland said the ministers had strongly condemned Iraq's incursion into the northern safe-haven.
GCAT	A U.S. district judge has refused to dismiss a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of thousands of Nicaraguan immigrants who claim the United States has illegally denied them residency. U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King, in a ruling issued on Friday but made public on Monday, said his court had jurisdiction over the lawsuit and ordered the government to file an answer to the complaint within 30 days. "It's a big victory. It's without precedent," said Jose Lagos, spokesman for Nicaraguan Fraternity, a party to the lawsuit. "It will allow our lawsuit to go ahead." The lawsuit, filed on March 23, alleged that thousands of Nicaraguans who fled the U.S.-backed Contra war in their homeland during their 1980s had been illegally denied resident status, leaving them in immigration limbo while allowing them to work and pay taxes. It named as defendants President Bill Clinton, Attorney General Janet Reno and Immigration and Naturalisation Service Commissioner Doris Meissner and claimed class-action status on behalf of 50,000 Nicaraguans, most of them living in Miami. The lawsuit represented just one salvo in an ongoing battle between immigrant advocates and the government over amendments to immigration law that took effect April 1. The changes left thousands of refugees from Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador and other countries open to deportation. Lawyers for Nicaraguan immigrant groups say the legal changes had forced hundreds of Nicaraguans underground, moving from house to house to avoid deportation. The suit asked the court to rule that the U.S. government violated the constitutional rights of the refugees and to grant "orderly determination" of their asylum claims. King's ruling came on a motion to dismiss the suit in which the government claimed the court did not have jurisdiction. In a separate lawsuit on similar issues, King in June issued a preliminary injunction which prevented the INS from ordering mass deportations. He set a trial for Jan. 5. In July, Reno announced a package of initiatives to protect immigrants, including a vow to review a ruling by the Immigration Appeals Board that could have resulted in mass expulsions and legislation to Congress to ease restrictions on immigrants.

ECAT	A Canadian manufacturing firm hoping to locate a plant in Vermont was reconsidering the move because of uncertainty over property tax reform. Vermont and the tiny town of Milton have been negotiating a complicated agreement over taxes and other issues with Ontario, Canada-based Husky Injection Molding Systems Ltd which makes plastic goods. If the deal goes through, Milton and the rest of Chittenden County will gain as many as 2500 high-paying jobs.   But the Vermont Supreme Court's recent landmark decision overturning the state education funding system threatens to squelch the deal. The Vermont Legislature, in order to find a more equitable method to pay for education, is considering imposing a statewide property tax. Such a move would supersede Milton's offer to lower its property-tax rate for Husky's benefit. Husky has set a June 1 deadline for making a decision on whether to go ahead with the deal, according to the privately-held company's spokesman Dick Schlimm.   "It's no secret that we're interested in the tax debate," Schlimm said. He recently wrote Vermont Governor Howard Dean a personal letter outlining the company's concerns. Dean said yesterday that he had not read the letter yet but that he will respond to it shortly. "I'm always concerned if a company the size of Husky is unhappy," the governor said. William Shouldice, the state's Development Director concedes that other companies have been shy about moving to Vermont because of the prospect of higher property taxes. The state Senate is currently wrangling over details of the property tax plan. Even when a plan passes the Senate, it must be reconciled with the already-passed House plan.

ECAT	Lebanese President Elias Hrawi urged Arab and other countries on Monday to give more aid to Lebanon and increase investment in the country. "We beseech the brothers and friends for more support and investment here because hastening Lebanon's revival supports the stability of the whole region," Hrawi said in his annual address to foreign diplomats. Hrawi said the "Friends of Lebanon" meeting of donor nations in Washington last month which pledged some $3.2 billion in aid reflected international interest in Lebanon and its regional and international importance. Some Lebanese officials state privately that the conference only brought pledges of $170 million in extra commitments from donor nations and the rest had already been committed. Hrawi said the government gave guarantees to capital invested there and was careful to maintain a free economy and safeguard the country's legendary banking secrecy law. "We are keen to keep a free economy and we adhere to banking secrecy in addition to the guarantees from the government to invested capital, its freedom of movement and returns," Hrawi said. He said Lebanon would not be a base for money-laundering operations and authorities would fight all attempts to smuggle or trade narcotics there after successfully eradicating drugs cultivation in the country.
MCAT	IPE Oct gas oil rose $7.50 a tonne to settle at $243.25, confirming its position as market leader during a period of low distillate stocks in the United States, brokers said. The October contract rose to a five-year high of $244 before easing back, supported during the afternoon session by NYMEX heating oil which set a post Gulf War high of $72.90 a gallon. "Heating oil has broken a new high and it ratched up gas oil to new levels. They are pushing and pulling each other," a broker said.   IPE gas oil at these levels is at its highest for the prompt contract in five years. The next target is $246 a tonne, dealers said. "This would require heating oil to get a boost above 73 cents and so far it looks a bit anaemic," the broker said. Distillates were boosted by Tuesday's API data which showed U.S. weekly distillate stocks fell to 112.3 million barrels, down 18.7 million from a year ago.   IPE Brent crude oil futures failed to keep up with gas oil although it found good support at a low of $23.07 a barrel. November Brent was trading 16 cents up at $23.23 a barrel after failing to break through a high of $23.45 a barrel. "Crudes have been reticent all day to follow the market and gasoline has been neutral. It is still the gas and heat show," the broker said. -- Kate Dourian +44 171 542 4088
CCAT	Volvo Car sales in Japan and Germany rose by 22.1 percent and 33 percent respectively in October, a company spokesman said on Tuesday. The car division of the Swedish vehicle manufacturer sold 1,534 cars in Japan last month, spokesman Ingmar Hesslefors told Reuters. He said this brought total sales for the period January to the end of October to 20,241 cars in Japan, a rise of 21.8 percent on the same period a year earlier. In calendar 1995 Volvo sold 20,550 cars in Japan. "Our forecast for sales of around 23,000 cars in Japan for full year 1996 remains unchanged," Hesslefors said. In Germany sales rose 33 percent to 3,201 in October, according to preliminary figures. For January to October Volvo sold 26,640 cars in Germany which was a slight fall from a year ago when 27,665 cars were sold. "In October we sold 1,500 of the new S40/V40 model in Germany and this shows that it is stating to make its mark in that country. It's a break in the trend," Hesslesfors told Reuters. Although Volvo Cars' sales for the year to date were 0.4 percent down on last year, the company expected to match 1995 full year sales. "Last year we sold 31,000 cars in Germany in the full year and we expect to reach around that level this year too," he said. -- Henrik Alberius, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1250

CCAT	IPALCO Enterprises Inc said Thursday it will spend $401.2 million to repurchase all of the approximately 12.5 million shares tendered at or below $32 per share through its Dutch Auction tender offer that expired last week. IPALCO on February 25 said it would buy back 12 million shares, or 21 percent of the outstanding common, at a price not lower than $29 nor more than $34 per share. The lowest price that allowed the company to acquire 12 million shares was $32.   All shareholders who tendered shares at or below this price before March 27 will be paid $32 per shasre for their shares. The energy company said it is acquiring the additional shares above 12 million in lieu of the proration it previously announced. That will further reduce IPALCO's outstanding shares to about 44.5 million, which will benefit remaining shareholders while simplifying the transaction for tendering shareholders.

ECAT	Pakistan, being the cheapest emerging market, could attract funds leaving the South East Asian markets, which were seen heading for a recession, a foreign fund manager said on Tuesday. "Things are changing in South East Asia," Landon Thomas of Morgan Stanley Asset Management, London, told a business conference in Karachi. "They (South East Asia) are close to a recession, which offers a huge oppurtunity, for a lot of this money can come to Pakistan," he added. Thomas said Pakistan had the cheapest valuation compared to all other emerging markets and could draw an estimated "$50 billion pool of dissatisfied money in the emerging markets looking for a home." But he said Pakistan faced a crisis of confidence and would have to give incentives and undertake reforms to attract funds. "The market is cheap but pessimism is deeper," Thomas said. He said lack of saving, inadequate growth, mismanagement of economy, political instability and corruption were the reasons that had kept foreign investors out of the Pakistani markets. "Investors would want to see a sea of change," he added. Thomas said Pakistan should push through a mix of supply and demand side measures to restore long term confidence. Pakistan should also cut military expenditure, impose agriculture tax, hold a population census, go for privatisation and carry out accountability of the corrupt, he added. He said the three-month-old government of Nawaz Sharif was percieved as the strongest in Asia due to its massive mandate and was best placed to bring in concrete reforms. "Once they (foreign investors) sense that the things are on the right path ,there is a rally out there lurking, and will come much earlier."
ECAT	German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, struggling to whip Bonn's finances into shape for the single European currency, said on Sunday he expected the 1996 German budget deficit to be above earlier projections. Waigel told Focus magazine the earlier estimate of about 60 billion marks ($40.4 billion) would be surpassed due to higher costs for unemployment and slow economic growth. But he said the deficit would not top 70 billion marks. Waigel's comments followed government sources on Friday saying Bonn would be forced to boost its supplement to the Federal Labour Office by seven billion marks and its payments of unemployment assistance by 5.5 billion marks. Budget experts from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition were also involved in talks at the weekend aimed at cutting 1997 government spending to meet the Maastricht Treaty criteria for Germany to enter currency union in 1999. The talks were expected to approve a plan by Waigel to raise 1997 government borrowings to 56.5 billion marks, up seven billion marks from a medium-term plan drafted in 1995. The 1997 draft budget was approved by the cabinet in July and should have a first reading in parliament this week. The weekend saw political temperatures rise as unions held demonstrations in major cities across the country to protest against the government's planned austerity measures, which they say will hurt jobs. Waigel has vowed to bring Germany's overall public deficit down to 2.5 percent of GDP in 1997, comfortably below the three percent target set out in the treaty. But few economic experts believe Waigel's rosy scenario. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said on Thursday Germany might just make the three percent target in 1997 if it implemented all its planned savings measures. The federal budget deficit, however, accounts for only half Germany's total public deficit. The rest stems from state and local governments, pensions and social security, over which Waigel has less control. Hitting the economic criteria required for monetary union will be difficult since an economic slump has hurt tax revenues, boosted outlay on jobless benefits and lowered the tolerable deficit ceiling, according to experts. Germany and other European nations must meet strict deficit and debt targets if they hope to qualify for EMU in 1997, the key year for deciding the starting participants when the single currency, called the Euro, is launched in 1999.

CCAT	Yorkshire-based chemicals group Allied Colloids Plc said on Tuesday that its strategy of growing organically remained unchanged, despite the $390 million acquisition of CPS Chemical Co Inc of the U.S. Chief executive David Farrar said Allied Colloids "has not been acquisitive" by tradition. "We saw this as an opportunity that does not come along very often," Farrar said in a telephone interview with Reuters following the announcement of the purchase and interim results.   "This is a good strategic fit for us. CPS are in the same business as us, the chemistry is similar. We have had a long association with them and have been major customers of theirs for eight years." The move will substantially increase Allied Colloids' sales in the U.S, which already accounts for more than 30 percent of its annual turnover. CPS, which has plants in Arkansas and New Jersey, had sales of $157 million last year, some 75 percent of which were in the domestic market.   Farrar said Allied, which provides chemicals for a wide range of industries including paper-making, minerals, textiles, oil and pharmaceuticals, remained committed to expansion in other key marekts, notably Europe and the Far East. But this would be achieved "by organic growth." Allied Colloids believes the acquisition of CPS, which is partly being financed by a two-for-seven rights issue to raise 173 million stg, will be earnings enhancing in its first full financial yuear. It said it also expected to benefit from substantial U.S. tax credits.   Farrar said the combined group would have a workforce of around 3,500 following the addition of CPS' 360 employees. He said CPS, which makes chemical intermediates and finished polymers for industry, will complement Allied in a number of areas, notably in coatings, paper and pollution control. It will also add to Allied's technological base and provide new products to market through its existing 400-strong salesforce. The rights issue and acquisition were accompanied by an upbeat statement on prospects, with Allied Colloids predicting a continued improvement in second-half sales and profits.   First-half pretax profits rose 3.8 percent to 21.1 million stg on sales up 9 percent at 207.6 million stg. Farrar said sharp falls in raw material costs earlier this year started to feed into second-quarter results, but their full impact would be felt in the second half. He predicted that gross profit margins would increase by 1 percentage point in the second half from the 37.5 percent seen in the first half and the 36.2 achieved in the 12 months to March. Allied is also predicting a further pick-up in sales growth in the second half of the year, implying full-year sales of more than 430 million stg compared with 393 million a year earlier. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
CCAT	British supermarket group ASDA Plc should continue to outperform the market, chief executive Allan Leighton told Reuters in a telephone interview. "Do I believe that we can continue to outperform the industry? Yes I do," Leighton said. He said the company expected to refurbish around five stores and open five new ones this year, which will create "about 3,500-4,000 jobs and the distribution centre...we'll be close to 5,000 jobs this year, probably."   ASDA's sales from existing stores rose 9.2 percent in the year ending May 3 as pretax profits before exceptionals jumped 16 percent to 353.7 million stg, and it paid out a total dividend of 3.05 pence per share. "I would be expecting us to outperform not just on sales but operating profit too," he said, but added that achieving such strong sales growth "becomes more and more difficult". Leighton said that last year, ASDA's gross margins were flat and its prices became cheaper as optimising margin mix allowed the company to invest in price. He said operating margins were "about flat". The company said in a statement that industry figures showed it was eight percent cheaper than its major competitors, and Leighton said: "Provided the gap is maintained or increased versus our competitors that's the key measure for me."   Leighton said planning permission for new stores was "getting tougher," but stressed a point of difference for ASDA was the size of its superstores and location in out-of-town sites. He said he felt ASDA's clothing business, sold under the "George" brand set up with George Davis who worked with Next, could be twice the current size. Clothing sales at existing stores rose 28 percent. Leighton said there was "still a lot to do...to deliver this kind of performance consistently but I think we will". He said volume sales of clothing in the group's best stores were on similar levels to shops in the high street but operating costs were half. "If I can sort the supply chain out...you can then generate a quality offer...at 20 percent of the price. That is a set of economics that nobody else can emulate," Leighton said. He said another area where the company was focusing efforts and had opportunities was in the change towards eating take-away and ready-made meals. "We have the biggest Indian take-away business in the UK and we have the biggest fish-and-chip take-away business in the UK," he said. Leighton added that in groceries, "there's still a lot of innovation that you can do". ASDA had "lots to do", particularly in beers, wines and spirits and frozen foods. "The only way in a very mature marketplace that you can outperform and generate real return is you've got to innovate faster than anybody else," he said. -- Jo Winterbottom, London Newsroom +44171 542 7717
MCAT	U.S. mortgage-backed securities prices were trading near session highs at late afternoon Thursday, taking their cue from a small rally in Treasury prices. Most fixed-coupon pass-through yield spreads to Treasuries were relatively flat as credit markets had little new economic information to digest. "(Yield spreads) are pretty stable here," said one trader. Given the shape of the Treasury yield curve, he said, mortgage yield spreads "are in pretty decent shape."   Mortgage prices remained firm amid light trading volume. One pass-through trader said there were rumors earlier in the session of a "big seller" of mortgages versus a buyer of 10-year notes. "Although the dollar rolls have all collapsed, and that might be an indication of it, I have not seen any selling and I have seen absolutely no selling from mortgage bankers," the trader said. By 1500 EDT/1900 GMT, fixed-coupon mortgage prices were up 5/32 to 11/32 overall, while comparable Treasury prices were 6/32 to 10/32 higher.   Specifically, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5-percent paper was up 8/32 at 99-11/32, yielding 89 basis points over the five-year Treasury note. Comparable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issues were up 8/32 as well, at 99-15/32 and 99-19/32, respectively. Five-year Treasuries were up 6/32 at 6.59 percent, and 10-year notes were up 10/32 at 6.72 percent. (( -- Jeff Coelho, 212-859-1660 ))

CCAT	Three foreign bidders for a $450 million Mexican power plant project passed initial tender requirements on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) said. The three consortium passed technical prerequisites for the Monterrey II combined cycled power plant, Jose Luis Uribe Ortega told Reuters. Bidders for the plant are: Japan's Mitsubishi Corp, Japan's Marubeni Corp and a union between Japan's Nissho-Iwai Corp and Swiss-Swedish ABB Energy Ventures Inc., the CFE said. A decision on the winning bidder is due in the first two weeks of September, Uribe said. Monterrey II is due to come on line in 2000 with electricity generating capacity of 450 megawatts, he said. The estimated construction cost is $450 million, Uribe added. The plant is part of a national spree of power plant tenders for the second half of the year. The new plants are aimed at boosting Mexico's output in anticipation of growing domestic electricity consumption. In coming days a decision is also expected on the winning bid for the 100-megawatt Cerro Prieto IV power plant. Bids for the plant have come from Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Kanematsu-ICA Fluor Daniel, Ansaldo de Mexico and Ormet International-GEC Alsthom-Turalmex.

ECAT	Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Roger Anderson on Tuesday said that liquidity of the inflation indexed note was important and a consideration when deciding how much to sell and that he expected it to improve as more securities are issued. Speaking to reporters following remarks to a financial group, Anderson said "we hope the liquidity will improve the more securities we issue." The Tresury will sell $7.0 billion of 10-year inflation index bonds on Wednesday. "Index notes," he said "will probably never be as liquid as Treasury bills but then nothing else in the world is as liquid as Treasury bills."

CCAT	Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA) is holding talks with French defence companies Matra and Alcatel aimed at possible future cooperation, a company spokesman said. Matra and Alcatel are interested in taking stakes in Thomson-CSF, which is about to be privatised. The DASA spokesman told Reuters talks were taking place, but said no conclusions had been reached. "Nothing has been decided at all," he said. The French government has said it will decide about the disposal of its 58 percent stake in Thomson by May 7. The Daimler-Benz unit has already made clear its intention to unify more of the German defence industry under its stewardship. DASA board member Werner Heinzmann has expressed interest in buying the defence electronics business of Siemens AG, and talks are also being held with Nuremberg-based Diehl about a takeover of its fuselage business. DASA's defence and civil systems division, with 9,000 employees, had sales of 2.6 billion marks in 1996, and aims to boost sales to 2.8 billion marks this year. -- Terence Gallagher, Bonn newsroom, 49-228-2609750
CCAT	It's no secret that many New Yorkers head over the border to New Jersey to shop since there's no sales tax on most clothes in the Garden State. They take to the bridges and tunnels and trains to escape New York City's 8.25 percent tax on coats, dresses, trousers, and the Empire State estimates it loses about $700 million a year from such cross-border shoppers. But now it's pay-back time. New York is fighting fire with fire. A one-week moratorium on sales tax on most clothing began on January 18 and will run for one week. New York City and State have decided to make shopping trips to the suburbs in New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Connecticut not worth the car, bus or train fare. For the week, New York state lifted its four percent sales tax, and all but seven of New York's 62 counties ditched local taxes on clothes, keeping most state residents from paying tax on any item under $500. The state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority also decided to put on hold its 0.25 percent tax for the week. New Yorkers pay varying sales taxes across the state, depending on local tax rates. Nassau County, on suburban Long Island, has the state's highest sales tax of 8.50 percent while Delaware County, on the state's Southern Tier, has the lowest with six percent. For New York State retailers, January is a rather slow month. It's hard to get terribly excited about annual white sales for bedding and other housewares. In terms of clothing, there are deep discounts all over town, but the wares are looking kind of shopworn about now. What better time to bring in some excitement. Actually, state officials originally wanted to have the tax-free week in December, but it was decided the loss to the state would have been too great. So rather than omit sales tax during the busiest time of the year, the experiment was put off until this week, risking $20 million in tax revenue to determine how much the tax really harms retailers, New York officials said. State and local spokesmen drew a blank when asked if other states had ever had a sales tax suspension like New York's. Is it paying off? While it's just midweek, retailers can't give a final tally whether people are buying. The New York City Department of Finance doesn't expect any definitive reports from retailers for a few months. From all appearances, shoppers are indeed coming in, at least to browse. Not only are retailers marking down clothes from 20 percent to 75 percent to clear the racks for spring fashions, but the suspension of sales tax appears to be the final sweetener. At Today's Man in Manhattan, store officials said sales were up 250 percent over the same week last year, keeping in mind that last year's January was one non-stop snow storm. "I expected a huge increase, but I didn't expect it to be as good as it was," store manager Greg Cabral said. As a customer said at Forman's of Orchard Street, a discounter of women's clothing, "I wouldn't be buying the Austin Reed outfit if it wasn't for no tax." At Loehmann's in Lake Success, on Long Island, sales associates said they had never seen so many shoppers on a Sunday. The line for the cashier was several minutes long. "It is long overdue," Walter Eisenhardt, store manager of Barneys New York in the World Financial Centre, said. "It is giving New Yorkers the opportunity to enjoy the same tax-free purchases as someone in New Jersey has been able to enjoy all these years." While only five states have no sales tax on clothing, a number have some exemptions on work clothes or childrens clothes, according to the Commerce Clearing House, a publisher of detailed tax data.
GCAT	Weeping mothers marched through downtown Bogota on Thursday, calling for the release of their soldier sons captured by leftist guerrillas more than a month ago. Thirty-five mothers paraded photos of their loved ones, who were among the more than 60 seized by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as prisoners of war in the jungles of southern Colombia on Aug. 30. Some blamed the army for sending their sons, little more than raw recruits, into a combat zone. Others urged prayers for the FARC, saying the rebels' fight was with the government, not their boys. "This situation is destroying my heart. Only God knows the pain a mother feels when her son is kidnapped," said Hermencia Vargas, mother of 19-year-old Edwin Sierra from Florencia in southern Caqueta province. As the 1,000-strong march snaked past graffiti declaring "Long live Communism" and "Yanks go home," a flock of pigeons rose into the air -- would-be doves of peace. Communist guerrillas rose up in arms more than three decades ago in Colombia. But the attack on Aug. 30 in which more than 27 soldiers died caught the military off guard and signalled the start of the bloodiest rebel offensive in recent memory. The International Committee of the Red Cross is mediating the prisoner crisis. In line with the FARC's demands, President Ernesto Samper this week agreed to allow an international delegation to witness the eventual handover of the soldiers.
ECAT	U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday warned Bosnia's Moslem, Croat and Serb presidents that they will be denied $100 million in IMF loans and more than $1 billion in private donations until they pass a budget, her spokesman said. Albright, leading a U.S. effort to increase international pressure on key parties to comply with the fraying Bosnia peace agreement, made her comments during a 15-minute meeting with the Balkan country's three chiefs -- Moslem Alija Izetbegovic, Croat Kresimir Zubak and Serb Momcilo Krajisnik. Although senior U.S. officials this week have made similar threats to Bosnia's leaders, this is the first time that Albright made the point to them directly. She will visit the Balkans this weekend to carry further her campaign for compliance with the 1995 U.S.-brokered Dayton peace accord. "The price of the $100 million is to pass a budget law," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters. Albright "specifically asked them to work hard on a new law that needs to be agreed to further the Bosnian state", he said. He stressed that this was not a unilateral U.S. threat but a common International Monetary Fund practice to condition its assistance on reforms. The United States has an effective veto at the IMF. Albright told the presidents that an international conference on Bosnia, which is expected to raise an estimated $1.4 billion, could not go forward until the budget was enacted, Burns said. Under the Dayton peace accord, Bosnia is supposed to be a unified state with two separate entities, one for Serbs and the other a Croat-Moslem federation. But Bosnia's ethnic factions have resisted integration and some U.S. officials believe they are not truly interested in peace. Agreeing on a common budget is one essential tool of a unified state. The three presidents finally reached agreement this week on a law establishing a central bank and they have also finally agreed on a customs law, accomplishments Albright praised, Burns said. With 30,000 NATO-led stabilisation force (SFOR) troops in Bosnia that are due to leave next June, Washington and its allies are increasingly concerned that their time for ensuring that fighting does not re-ignite next year is running out. The major western powers involved in Bosnia -- the United States, Britain, Germany, France and Russia -- were to meet with the Bosnian parties in Sintra later on Friday following a NATO meeting. Burns said all three presidents "pledged to work together" to get the budget agreed. After Albright left the meeting, the Bosnian officials met with senior members of Albright's team, including new U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard, and Carl Bildt, the international envoy for Bosnia, to continue work on the budget and other issues. The spokesman described Krajisnik as having told Albright one half of the Bosnian Serb republic was eager for her to visit Bosnia and the other half "fears you". Albright was also to meet in Sintra with Biljana Plavsic, the president of the Serb republic. The United States has tried to work with Plavsic as part of the peace process but Bosnian Serb hardliners have sought to prevent her cooperation.
CCAT	A group led by Tweedy Browne Co LP, a New York-based broker-dealer, said on Monday it raised its stake in Ryland Group Inc to 1,244,020 common shares or 8.09 percent from 6.84 percent held last November. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said its latest transactions include a net 37,865 common shares bought between December 3, 1996 and January 22, 1997 at prices ranging from $13.06818 to $13.875 per share. The group holds the stake for investment purposes, the filing said. Ryland is a Columbia, Md., based homebuilder and mortgage financing company.
MCAT	Pakistani cotton rates closed steady on Monday on low buying by spinners but they were expected to rise in the next few days on demand from exporters, dealers at the private Karachi Cotton Association (KCA) said. One dealer said spinners had slowed buying as they had enough stocks to last until the new crop arrives in early July in Sindh province, where it ripens earlier than in Punjab province. In the kerb market, NIAB-78 variety was quoted at 2,100/2,175 rupees per maund (37.32 kg), K-68 at 2,350/2,375 and MNH-93 at 2,380/2,400.
ECAT	Preliminary consumer price data from sample cities shows Italy's November annual inflation rate will be around 2.5 percent, down from 3.0 percent in October, state economic research body Isco said. An Isco report on the Italian economy said the average rate of inflation for 1996 was expected to be 3.9 percent, in line with government forecasts,but would fall to 2.6 percent in 1997. Isco said the economy is expected to grow 0.7 percent this year, against a government target of 0.8 percent, while gross domestic product growth in 1997 is seen rising 1.2 percent. But Isco said the increase in output in 1997 would not be sufficient to obtain "significant improvements" in the employment situation. It said a modest increase in the employment level would result in only a small reduction in this year's 12.1 percent unemployment rate to 11.9 percent next year. Regarding salaries, Isco said it had taken into account that in the renewal of contracts "contractual increases would be set in a way to incorporate a partial recovery of purchasing power, in line with contracts which have already been renewed". The institute said that it believed pro capita salaries in 1997 would increase 4.1 percent in the economy as a whole and 4.3 percent in the industrial sector, against 4.9 and 5.2 percent respectively in 1996. It said the cost of labour in the economy as a whole was expected to decrease from 3.6 percent in 1996 to 3.1 percent in 1997. --Rome newsroom +396 678-2501
GCAT	Albanian President Sali Berisha on Friday formally called general elections for the troubled Balkan state for June 29, his office said. He called the elections although most political parties have threatened to boycott the poll.   "The president of the republic...decreed today the dissolution of the National Assembly before the end of its mandate and the holding of new parliamentary elections on Sunday June 29, 1997," Berisha's office said in a statement. The early elections are seen the key element in restoring order in Albania after the country was torn apart by riots in February and March after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes bankrupted thousands of people. Most political parties are threatening to boycott the poll in a dispute over the election law, which they say favours Berisha. European Union envoy Franz Vranitzky seemed to have broken the deadlock on Thursday by persuading parliament to draft a new election law but the parties later said they still did not like the legislation.
GCAT	The trial of a pool mechanic charged in the gas poisoning of tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis began Tuesday with his attorney blaming the maker of a pool heating system and describing his client as a "scapegoat." Prosecutors have alleged that mechanic Bartholomew Torpey and his employer, East End Pools and Courts Inc., improperly rigged an exhaust pipe in the basement of a Southampton, Long Island, pool cottage where Gerulaitis slept. Gerulaitis, 40, was found dead Sept. 18, 1994, on the exclusive estate of developer friend Martin Raynes. Torpey was accused of failing to install the correct length of pipe from a pool heating system, trapping carbon monoxide gas near the room where Gerulaitis rested. Torpey was indicted on charges of criminally negligent homicide and the pool company was charged with second degree manslaughter. In opening arguments Tuesday in Torpey's trial in Suffolk County Court, attorney David Clayton charged that prosecutors, by allowing a key expert witness from manufacturer Teledyne Lars to testify before a grand jury, had given the expert immunity from prosecution. "In this case the District Attorney and the city let the big people take a hike and went after the smallest people on the face of the earth he could find," Clayton told the jury. He described Torpey as the "fall guy" and a "scapegoat". Clayton blamed Teledyne Lars and the expert witness, James Cosmano, whom he said was the last person in the pool cottage to work on the heater three days before Gerulaitis' death. Gerulaitis, who retired from the tennis circuit in 1984 but later returned to the game as a broadcaster, won 27 singles and nine doubles championships, including the 1977 Australian Open. He won millions of dollars but his career declined rapidly as he was treated for drug abuse. During his opening arguments, Assistant District Attorney Edward Helig slammed his hand down on the defence table and said, "the buck stops at this table right here. They're the people who did it, the people responsible for it." He told the jury that Torpey was not educated enough and did not care enough to make sure the pipe extended outside of the door. "When you see one item, the photograph of how this defendant installed and vented this heater, you don't need to be an expert to see the photograph and know and say 'that's wrong'," Helig said. "He just didn't care enough, didn't take the time to find out how to vent this thing." Gerulaitis' mother Aldona Gerulaitis has filed a $63 million civil lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court, citing nine defendants, including Torpey, the pool company and Raynes.

MCAT	Mexican stocks could not escape the wave of selling that washed over Wall Street on Friday, closing lower in a day where one of the few bright spots was an initial public offering by broadcaster TV Azteca. The leading IPC stock index fell below the key 5,000-point support level to 4,956.61 points, off 58 points on the day. Still, Mexican stocks held up well compared with a big sell-off on Wall Street, where U.S. stocks suffered their second-biggest point loss in history.   Azteca, Mexico's second largest broadcaster, issued shares on the Mexican and New York stock exchanges. Its CPO shares in Mexico rose from an initial offer price of 35.43 pesos to 36.80 pesos.

ECAT	The National Bank of Hungary's (NBH) surprise rate hike announced earlier this week will not substantially increase the debt service expenditures of the state budget, the Finance Ministry said on Friday. "The rate hike will stabilise interest rates temporarily, but will not affect state budget expenditures substantially," Deputy Secretary of State Csaba Laszlo told Reuters. The NBH raised the interest rate of its six-month deposit facility by 0.25 percentage points to 21.00 percent on Monday, shocking the markets which had expected the continuation of a one year long trend of declining interest rates and inflation. The NBH said its move was aimed at maintaining real interest levels so as to protect savings. Analysts welcomed the NBH move and said inflation was likely to move a little upward in March and April and may rise slightly further or stabilise by the end of the third quarter of the year, due to energy and food price rises. "Inflation may be higher in March and April," Laszlo said, adding that this would not change the underlying falling trend. "We expect interest rates to go down in line with declining inflation," he said. The Finance Ministry and the NBH expects inflation to drop to some 17 percent by December from 18.9 percent in January, while the forecasts of 15 analysts for December 1997 in a recent Reuters survey averaged at 18.39 percent. Yields on government securities rose slightly on the secondary market following the NBH rate hike, but turnover slumped as buyers demanded sunstantially higher yields with the supply side hesitating to sell and suffer losses. Traders were uncertain whether the NBH planned to keep its interest rates at current levels for the longer term. "The pessimistic version (for sellers) is that the NBH will keep its interest rates (at the current level) for as much as two months," a trader said earlier this week. "At that point even those who have not sold so far may do so." Analysts said the NBH interest rate hike may create some tension between the central bank and the Government Debt Management Agency, as it may increase the state budget debt financing burden. -- Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327 4040
GCAT	Afghanistan's Islamic Taleban militia appeared on Thursday to have suffered reverses at the hands of ousted army chief Ahmad Shah Masood, with a town south of previous fighting being prepared for assault. The Taleban were setting up anti-aircraft guns in the middle of the main road through Charikar, 60 km (40 miles) north of Kabul, which they took two weeks ago. The nearby village of Bagram, next to Kabul's military airport, was deserted but the base was still in Taleban hands. Shops in Charikar were closed and nervous local people on the streets said they heard small arms fire an estimated five km (three miles) north of the town on the road to Jabal-os-Siraj at the mouth of the Salang Pass, where Masood's men attacked on Tuesday and drove the Taleban back. In mid-afternoon, however, there was no sign of fighting in or around Charikar. But local people said they had seen many Taleban, dead and wounded, being ferried south towards Kabul. Other reports appeared to confirm the Taleban's opponents were on the move. U.N. sources in Islamabad, Pakistan, said Masood's forces attacked Taleban fighters at his old headquarters at Jabal os-Siraj and moved south to threaten the airbase. "All we know is that Masood has moved out of the Panjsher Valley, had a go at the Taleban in Jabal os-Siraj and Charikar, and has moved on Bagram," a U.N. source said. Earlier, travellers said the sound of heavy fighting was apparent just north of Jabal-os-Siraj, a 30-minute drive from Charikar, but there was no word on whether the town at the foot of the wall of the Hindu Kush had fallen. "It was very close to Jabal-os-Siraj," said one traveller who asked not to be identified. A Taleban source in Pakistan denied that Jabal os-Siraj had fallen, saying Taleban fighters had killed four of Masood's men and captured 47 in fighting there on Thursday. On Wednesday, the front line of the Taleban was 15 km (nine miles) north of the town, witnesses said. That was 15 to 20 km (nine to 12 miles) south of their front line before Masood's men launched a suprise attack on Tuesday. Confirmation of the reports was not immediately available. Western reporters were barred from travelling to the area. On Tuesday, the Taleban battlefield commander in the Salang, Maulavi Khairulla Haqani, told Reuters Television his men had stemmed the advance of Masood's ethnic Tajik fighters down the Salang. He said fighting had been fierce, but declined to comment on casualties. Western aid workers, however, quoted witnesses as saying they had seen at least 100 Taleban bodies and many more wounded being taken to Jabal-os-Siraj. The attack forced the Taleban, who have swept to control of three-quarters of Afghanistan since the movement was born in religious schools in refugee camps in Pakistan two years ago, to break off attempts to enter Masood's Panjsher valley fortress. They started the assault on Saturday, but by Wednesday evening not a single black-turbanned Taleban fighter was to be seen in Golbahar, a town 10 km (six miles) east of Jabal that sits astride the rocky gorge leading into the Panjsher. Days of heavy fighting had taken Taleban fighters only 500 metres (yards) into the gorge, which Masood blocked with landslides. In the Salang, there was no word on casualties among Masood's men, led by his former area commander, Basir Solangi, in an attack that cut off a large number of Taleban fighters, the aid workers said. When the largely ethnic Pushtun Taleban moved north after taking Kabul, Solangi retreated north into territory controlled by Uzbek chief Abdul Rashid Dostum, who talked with ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani this week and said Masood was to join them. Also in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, from which Dostum controls six of Afghanistan's provinces, was Karim Khallili, leader of the Hezb-i-Wahadat faction which controls territory to the west of Jabal-os-Siraj. The Taleban leadership in Kabul dismissed any possibility of an alliance between the groups, which have been enemies in the past.

CCAT	Polish insurance company Polisa SA, which expects to enter the Warsaw bourse in mid-November, aims to boost its market share by targetting the country's fast-growing number of small and medium sized enterprises. The firm's president Stanislaw Gutek told Reuters on Thursday he believed the strategy would enable Polisa to raise its market share to up to 4.5 percent in 1997 and then 10 percent in the next few years, from the current 3.7 percent. "We believe the area of small and medium-sized firms is our future, taking into account their growing number and needs ... but this doesn't mean we are not eyeing bigger clients, especially now, when our large capital lets us do so," he said. The reserve and share capital of the company, Poland's third largest insurer and which provides non-life insurance, totals 41.5 million zlotys. It reported net profit of 2.6 million zlotys on 123.1 million zlotys gross premiums in 1995. Gutek said Polisa felt strong enough not to have to eagerly hunt for an investor, but said that it might find one in the second half of 1998. Polisa would be interested in a minority investor from either inside or outside the insurance sector, which would take a 10 to 15-percent stake, he added. "We have time ... but let's say we are flirting with several foreign institutions that could boost our capital in future. We are open for Polish investors as well," he said. Gutek said Polisa was also considering taking part in a planned consolidation of Polish insurance firms. "We see some possibilities for cooperation, carrying out common policy, mergers with other firms or purchasing ailing insurers, but we have to talk about it to our shareholders before we reveal any details," he said. He added that one of these possibilities could materialise in the beginning of 1997. Gutek said Polisa did not plan to build up a holding company, but said it was entering areas which might prove profitable, such as the life insurance sector through Polisa Life SA, in which Polisa has a 26-percent stake. He said Polisa had a 37-percent stake, to be diluted to 26 percent, in Agro-Polisa, a firm which was to provide insurance to farmers and was now waiting for a finance ministry licence. "We believe the farmers' insurance market, although quite difficult because farmers are reluctant to buy any form of insurance, has a future in Poland," he said. The largest of Polisa's shareholder, BIG bank subsidiary Bel-Leasing, has a 10.9-percent stake in the firm. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700
ECAT	The Treasury's budget department, which is preparing various options for a second round of cuts in the 1997 budget, will not recommend raising taxes, Treasury sources said. But the sources noted that the budget department's proposal still needs the approval of Finance Minister Dan Meridor and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before being brought to the cabinet, therefore the final plan could include tax increases. The size of the additional cut will be determined next week, after budget and income data from November become available. But the sources said the amount of the cut could range from 1.5 billion to 2.3 billion shekels. The cabinet will meet on December 9 to vote on the additional cuts, which will then be sent to parliament for approval. Legislators are still haggling over the original 1997 budget proposal of 190.8 billion shekels, which included 4.9 billion shekels in cuts. The budget department will present to Netanyahu two options for the second round of cuts. One will include detailed suggestions for cuts from each ministry while the other will determine only the amount to be cut from each ministry and leave it up to the ministers to decide how to implement the cuts. According to the budget department's plan, the additional cuts would fall most heavily on housing and social welfare spending, the sources said.
CCAT	Software company Borland International Inc. said Wednesday it expected to report an operating loss for the current quarter. The company said it expected a loss of 52 cents to 62 cents a share on revenues of $33 million to $36 million for its fiscal third quarter ending Dec. 31. In the same quarter a year ago, Borland reported a profit of $849,000, or 3 cents per share, on revenues of $47.3 million. Borland attributed the loss to not shipping any new products in the quarter and slowing sales of existing, mature products as customers anticipate upcoming and previously announced product releases.
ECAT	Middle Eastern and North African countries need to overhaul investment and trade laws to foster regional integration and foreign investment, a top U.S. trade official said on Tuesday. Stuart Eizenstat, U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, said the pursuit of peace alone would not be enough to attract investors and boost intra-regional trade. "There is vast potential in the region," he said at the Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference. "The question is will we see the Middle East have the same kind of take-off that Asia and Latin America have experienced over the past several years." Eizenstat said some Middle Eastern countries needed a clear commercial code, deregulation, lower tariffs, legal predictability and more privatisation. Barriers including the boycott of Israel, differing standards and conflicting regulations were "inhibiting integration". "The countries in the Middle East have demonstrated progress in many of these areas. Once these reforms continue to take root increased foreign investment and jobs will surely follow. Peace may be one of the preconditions for prosperity," he said. The three-day conference which started on Tuesday has focused partly on how peace between Israel and Arabs could help encourage foreign investment and prosperity. But economists and officials at the meeting said MENA region countries needed to get their own houses in order. They cited insufficient intellectual property laws, legal uncertainties and high duties. Intra-regional trade is limited to about seven percent of the total trade of Middle Eastern and North African countries, Eizenstat said, compared with more than 60 percent in the European Union and more than 30 percent in Asia. He said this could be improved with a "continued political commitment to peace" and "integrated commercial arrangements". Makboul bin Ali bin Sultan, Oman's commerce and industry minister, said export and investment information was lacking. Nemat Shafik, the World Bank's manager for the Middle East and North Africa private sector, said non-oil exports in the region of 250 million people "have been incredibly low," or about the same as Finland, which has some six million people. She said per capita average exports were $100 in MENA compared with $3,000 in South East Asia. "Export growth in the MENA region has lagged but several countries have made important strides and I think we may be on the verge of a turning point," Shafik said in a speech. "Clearly there is an enormous need to increase the non-oil exports." Shafik said better private exporter incentives were needed. "I would go to zero tariffs as fast as I could," she said.
CCAT	Apple Computer Inc said Friday it introduced two PC-compatible computers that have compatibility with the Windows software standard developed by Microsoft Corp. The computers -- the Power Macintosh 7300/180 and the Power Macintosh 4400/200 -- are targeted to business and education customers, the company said. The 166 MHz Intel Pentium processor PCI card, included with the 7300/180 Macintosh, also is available as an upgrade card, allowing PCI-based Power Macintosh computers to run MS-DOS and Windows applications.   The new Power Macintosh systems bundled with PC compatibility cards are scheduled to be available in volume by the end of May and the new PCI card is scheduled to be available in June, Apple said. Based in Cupertiono, Calif., Apple unveiled the new computer systems at a multimedia technology fair held in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. "Many of our business and education customers need to be compatible with the Windows operating system, but they will not sacrifice the ease of use and power of the Macintosh," said Phil Schiller, an Apple vice president of marketing.   Both computers will be able to run software written for either an Apple or Windows-compatible systems at the same time. The Power Macintosh 7300/180 unit will be powered by a speedy MHz PowerPC 604e chip along with the Pentium chip. Apple's Power Macintosh 4400/200 will be powered by a 200 MHz PowerPC 603e processor and a Cyrix Corp PR166 6x86 chip. The former computer will retial for about $3,200, Apple said. The latter will cost about $2,400. The PC compatibility card will sell for $1,000, the company said. Apple introduced its first PC-compatible Power Macintosh with an Intel chip one year ago.

GCAT	Philippine President Fidel Ramos said on Friday he was confident that Christian opposition would fade to a peace deal Manila has initialled with Moslem rebels. He said the pact initialled on Friday in the Indonesian capital Jakarta contained several revisions limiting the functions of the proposed Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD). The agreement, which envisages the setting up of the SPCPD as a forerunner to a Moslem autonomous region, will be formally signed by Ramos and Moro National Liberation Front leader Nur Misuari in Manila on Monday. "With the modifications introduced in the final agreement after long negotiations ... I am confident that the opposition to the peace agreement will considerably be reduced and that eventually the peace and development process will be smoothly implemented," Ramos said in a statement. Among the changes in the peace deal were the making of the study of Islam in public schools optional instead of mandatory, and limiting the council's power to only those to be explicitly defined by the president. The Philippine government's chief negotiator, Manuel Yan, and Misuari initialled the peace agreement in Jakarta. In June, the government announced an interim peace deal, prompting fierce opposition from Christians who accuse the government of selling out to Moslems. Some five million Moslems regard the southern island of Mindanao as their ancestral homeland, although they are now outnumbered three-to-one by Christian migrants. The pact aims to end a 24-year separatist revolt which has cost at least 125,000 lives.
CCAT	LONDON, April 30 ( Reuter)- Lockheed Martin Corp, will decide by mid-June on whether to proceed with the joint development of a new tanker/transport aircraft, Flight International said. The three companies have completed a "Phase I" study for what Lockheed-Martin describes as the New Strategic Aircraft (NSA), Flight said in its latest issue. It added that Lockheed-Martin Aeronautics sector president Mickey Blackwell told Flight that the U.S. group and the two European companies are discussing whether to proceed jointly to concept development. The possibility of a joint programme "looks favourable" but added that Blackwell said it is not clear whether development would be with the two European companies individually, or collectively or with Airbus Industrie consortium itself. The NSA is seen as a replacement for both Lockheed's  C-141 strategic airlifter and the Boeing KC-135 tanker aircraft at a cost of around $100 million, but not as a competitor for Europe's proposed Future Large Aircraft(FLA). It quotes Blackwell as saying Airbus has offered Lockheed "substantial" work on both its stretched long range A340 aircraft and the proposed A3XX large airliner. --Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+5017
CCAT	About 48,00 Washington Water Power Co electricity customers, most of which are in the Spokane area, were still without service early Thursday after heavy rains and snow damaged transmission lines Tuesday, the company said. The company had said the restoration of full service may take longer than previously thought. "This ice storm has caused the most damage to our system that I've seen in my 32 years with the company," said company chairman Paul Redmond. All transmission lines have been repaired, so crews are now working on the 47 distribution feeders damaged by the storm. The company had earlier reported that 37 feeders were affected. As of 0530 PST Thursday, service had been partially restored on 26 distribution feeders. By Thursday afternoon, the company said it expects to have 30 crews working on the restoration effort in Spokane County, with 40 crews expected by Friday. About 100,000 customers were initially affected on Tuesday afternoon by the 23 downed high-voltage transmission lines.

GCAT	Cambodia's newly appointed First Prime Minister Ung Huot said on Thursday that King Norodom Sihanouk had given his blessing to Phnom Penh's new government during a meeting in Beijing. Ung Huot and his powerful co-premier, Hun Sen, had five hours of talks with Sihanouk at the king's Beijing residence on Tuesday. "The king gave us his blessing and recognises the prime minister," Ung Huot told reporters at Phnom Penh airport upon his return from Beijing, where Sihanouk has been receiving medical treatment since February. Hun Sen toppled Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, on July 6 and then backed Ung Huot's nomination to replace the ousted prince. He had previously ruled with Ranariddh in an uneasy coalition government that took power after U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. Last week Sihanouk called Ung Huot a "puppet" of Hun Sen and said he still recognised Ranariddh as the legitimate first premier. Ung Huot showed reporters a copy of a news agency report that had been annotated by Sihanouk. Next to a section of the report that said the Cambodian delegation had come to seek the king's blessing, the monarch had written: "At lunch, I toasted their health." "That means the king already gives his blessing," Ung Huot said, pointing to Sihanouk's hand-written note. Political analysts in Phnom Penh said the king's approval was the last hurdle facing Hun Sen in his bid to legitimise his new government. Sihanouk had offered to abdicate on Monday, but said later that in their Tuesday meeting, Hun Sen had refused the offer. The king said on Thursday he would return to Cambodia before the end of the month to hold a Buddhist ceremony for peace and national reconciliation in Siem Reap, home of the famed Angkor temple complex. Hun Sen told reporters he had assured Sihanouk that he was the defender of the monarchy. "There were some people who reported to him that I will completely destroy the monarchy," Hun Sen told reporters. "I told the king and queen, please consider us the defenders of the monarchy. If anyone wants to end the monarchy, they have to put an end to my life first," he said. Hun Sen said the king also would attend the first meeting of Cambodia's Supreme Council of Magistry, a body, yet to be set up, that will oversee the functioning of the judicial system. But he gave no date. Hun Sen also dismissed a suggestion from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) that an informal meeting of all parties involved in the Cambodian problem be held, including Ranariddh and Hun Sen. "Any attempt to call an informal meeting between the government of Phnom Penh and Ranariddh would be a waste of time," Hun Sen said. ASEAN postponed Cambodia's entry to the group after Ranariddh was overthrown and has been trying to mediate a solution to the country's problems. Hun Sen insisted that if Ranariddh returns to Cambodia, he would have to face charges for illegal negotiations with the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group and for alleged weapons smuggling. Last week the Cambodian National Assembly voted to strip Ranariddh of his parliamentary immunity and a military court subsequently issued a warrant for his arrest. Asked if Ranariddh would be allowed to take part in an election planned for May next year, Hun Sen said: "The question of joining the election or not, you have to ask the court."
CCAT	Bank of Western Australia Ltd said on Wednesday it may not be able to sustain the level of profits achieved in the year to February 28, 1997 due to intense competition, lower lending rates and restructuring costs.   BankWest, 51.47 percent owned by the Bank of Scotland, earlier announced an A$94.5 million profit for the year to end-February compared with its prospectus forecast of a profit of A$100.2 million. The bank warned in February that results were likely to be five percent below the forecast. BankWest chairman Ian Mackenzie said in a statement accompanying its results that the banking industry would be characterised by rapid change and continued intense competition. "The bank is focussed on achieving improved operating efficency and on growing revenue to compensate for the pressure on interest margin," Mackenzie said.   "Nevertheless, recent cuts in lending rates will have their full effect in the current financial year and restructuring costs also will be incurred," he said. The impact would be felt particularly in the first half, he said. "In the circumstances, the bank might not be able to sustain the level of profits achieved in the year under review."   The interest margin narrowed to 3.1 percent compared with the prospectus forecast of 3.3 percent, and 3.4 percent in the year ended September 1995. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

"I saw him this morning and he's been spotted all over the City. Evidently he was planning to leave around lunchtime for Edinburgh," said an industry source who declined to be named. A spokesman acting for LVMH in London declined to comment. Arnault was not expected in London until Thursday but landed in London in his private Lear jet this morning. He flew on to meet fund managers at Standard Life and Scottish Widows in Edinburgh this afternoon, said another industry source. Arnault planned to return on Thursday to London to see more shareholders in an effort to persuade them that his proposal for the break up of Guinness and GrandMet will add more value for shareholders than a straight merger of the two companies, the sources said. -- Tim Farrand, London newsroom +44 171 542 6437
MCAT	The Philippine Central Bank has started offering dollars at 29 pesos after being absent from the market in the morning, dealers said on Monday.   Traders had said the currency market needed the central bank's presence to instill sobriety. They had expected a run on the peso down to 30 pesos after the central bank announced on Friday it would let the peso move in a new, wider range to end speculation. The peso had been prey to speculators after the de facto devaluation of the Thai baht two weeks ago. One trader said the monetary authority may have sold dollars also at 28.75 pesos. Traders said banks are still very uncertain about how the peso will move. "Volume is still so thin. The market is still wary," a trader said. The peso had fallen to a four-year low of 29.75 pesos on Monday after opening at 27.50. Volume was a small $30.5 million. -- Manila newsroom (63 2) 841-8937
ECAT	Romania's state budget deficit widened to 4.19 trillion lei ($768.8 million) at end-November from 3.66 trillion in the first 10 months of 1996, official data showed on Wednesday. Eleven-month spending was 20.19 trillion lei, up from 17.87 trillion at end-October. State revenues rose to 15.99 trillion lei over January-November from 14.21 trillion in the first 10 months. Overspending by the former leftist government in the 1996 election campaign led to a soaring public deficit estimated to account for 5.7 percent of gross domestic product at the end of 1996, against a target of 2.2 percent. The International Monetary Fund suspended loan tranches for Romania last year over foreign exchange market restrictions, slow reforms and lax budgetary discipline. Romania's new centrist coalition government, formed after general elections last November, is now negotiating a new loan accord with the IMF. Talks on loans are also under way with the World Bank and the European Union. The new cabinet, which pledged to strengthen financial discipline and cut taxes, has yet to draft a 1997 state budget. The IMF reccomended Romania to quickly tackle the budget deficit issue and consider further spending carefully. -- Mirela Eremia, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1-3120264 ($ = 5450 Romanian Lei)
CCAT	Philips Electronics NV said on Wednesday first quarter net profit from ordinary operations rose to 460 million guilders ($239 million) in 1997 from a year-earlier 377 million guilders and said it was on track to achieve its profit targets. Total first-quarter net profit mushroomed to 887 million guilders from a year-earlier 692 million. "The first-quarter results provide us with the confidence that we are on track following the improvement programme started in 1996," Philips said in a statement. "A number of restructuring programmes which are still underway should begin to contribute to profits over the next several quarters," it added. Total first-quarter net was buoyed by an extraordinary gain of 427 million guilders from the partial flotation of its shareholding in ASM Lithography, Philips said. Last year extraordinary gains amounted to 315 million guilders. The net result from normal operations came in ahead of analysts' consensus of 366 million guilders. ($ = 1.925 Dutch Guilders)
MCAT	The Croatian average money market rate edged down 40 basis points to 11.3 percent despite strong demand on Tuesday as banks mostly made call money borrowings. Dealers put daily trade at a meagre 24.2 million kuna against demand for 45 million.

Fresh placements accounted for 20.7 million kuna of which 18.7 million were call money loans struck at a higher weighted rate of 11 percent, up 10 basis points from Monday. Term loans remained unchanged ranging from 9.0 percent charged by insurers and interbank rates struck at 15 and 18 percent.

ECAT	Yugoslav deputy prime minister Danko Djunic said talks with commercial bank creditors to reschedule $2.4 billion of debt adjourned on Monday with no deal as yet, but he was "satisfied" with progress and the talks would resume on Tuesday.   "We discussed very seriously for more than three hours and we adjourned with the decision to meet tomorrow morning again to continue with their (banks') questions and clarifications," Djunic told Reuters. "I am satisfied with the course of the meeting and there will be more details as I hope there will be a press conference tomorrow," he added.   "We expressed willingness to settle the situation with the commercial bank creditors without any political conditions, but purely on a financial basis for everything that we have to repay starting from the IMF, World Bank, Paris Club, London Club and others," Djunic said in a telephone interview after the first day of talks. He declined to give further details on the status of the talks. Technical talks on a possible restructuring or rescheduling of Yugoslavia's London Club debt were last held late in 1996, when sources close to the negotiating team said the talks stumbled over Belgrade presenting an overly optimistic report on the country's economic situation. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7718
ECAT	Russian Economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin said on Tuesday he hoped the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would not delay payment of the next tranche of a $10 billion loan, saying to do so would be "very unjust." "I don't want that to happen. I think that would be unjust. If we take as a base the formal requirements it is clear that this is possible, but in the situation which Russia is in I think it would be a very unjust thing," Yasin told Reuters during a visit to Milan. Asked whether he was confident that the IMF would not delay payment, he said, "I am confident." Yasin, speaking through an interpreter after inaugurating a Milan centre for the promotion of investment in Russia, said the current IMF talks were very tough. An IMF mission arrived in Moscow last Wednesday for talks expected to last about a week. Sources close to the discussions said on Monday that the IMF was worried about low Russian tax collection. Asked how the talks had kicked off, he said "things are still very difficult. Russia can't collect taxes as it should and if it can't collect enough taxes, there will be problems with the budget...and there are problems." Tax revenues totalled a low 2.2 trillion roubles in cash in the first nine days of October. Overall tax receipts are about 40 percent below targeted levels. The IMF had delayed payment of one of the summer tranches of the loan because of tax shortfall worries but later released that $300 million tranche. "The Russian government has undertaken a series of extraordinary measures to collect taxes but unfortunately there are no results yet," Yasin said. Yasin said it was too early to predict the outcome of the IMF deliberations or to say what measures would be taken to change the 1997 draft budget which has been rejected by the Duma lower house of parliament. The 1997 draft budget provides for a 3.3 percent deficit of GDP compared with 3.85 percent in 1996. The Russian budget deficit was 9.2 trillion roubles in September, or 3.8 percent of GDP under the methods the IMF uses to calculate the gap, finance ministry data showed. The September figure compares with a 5.3 percent deficit IMF target for the whole of 1996. "This budget deficit will not grow," Yasin said. He said last week that stepping up borrowing would disrupt the entire process of resuming economic growth and restoring Russia's economy.
CCAT	Kuok Philippine Properties Inc said on Monday its board had agreed to infuse an additional 306.9 milion pesos in a Philippine-based real estate joint venture with Malaysia's Pelangi Bhd. Corporate secretary Cynthia Laureta told the Philippine Stock Exchange that Pelangi, which holds 40 percent of Carmona Heights Properties Inc (CHPI), would also pour in 204.6 million pesos.

ECAT	Brazilian inflation between Jan 21 and Jan 31 slowed to 0.22 percent, against 0.69 percent between Dec 21 and Dec 31 as measured by the IGP-M index released by the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV).   The IGP-M is composed by three other economic indicators. They are the IPA wholesale price index, which fell 0.18 percent in the period, the IPC consumer price index, which rose 0.88 percent in the period, and the INCC national index of construction costs, which gained 0.21 percent. The IPA has a 60 percent weighting in the IGP-M, the IPC a 30 percent weighting and the INCC 10 percent, the FGV said. The IGP-M index, which measures inflation over ten-day intervals, is published by the independent research institute Fundacao Getulio Vargas (FGV).

MCAT	Gold prices dipped lower on Thursday as market jitters mounted over the International Monetary Fund's plan to sell part of its gold reserves to help poor countries. "It's very psychological. Everyone knows it's not much gold spread over a long time and there's no guarantee it will even happen," a London-based dealer said. "But it's still making the market very nervous." Gold fixed at a fresh two-month low of $382.20 an ounce in the morning, down $1.30 from Wednesday afternoon's fix. Dealers said it was vulnerable to erode further to $380 an ounce. Prices have been sliding amid bearish market sentiment for days, ignoring potentially bullish news such has indication of strong U.S. economic growth and U.S.-Iraq tension. An IMF meeting to discuss ways to finance loans and debt relief to poor countries, slated for Friday, has heightened nervousness. IMF leadership has proposed selling five million of the Fund's 104 million ounces of gold to help pay for the aid, backed by most member nations including the U.S. and Britain. Fuelling speculation were comments late on Wednesday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who said the IMF was very close to an agreement to sell some gold. A few member nations, including Germany, have opposed the plan. But gold market analysts say the sales, if approved, would be small enough to be easily absorbed and structured over time to avoid disrupting the market. "The market has just talked itself into despair and I think it's overdone," said analyst Rhona O'Connell of T. Hoare and Co. "As far as the fundamental logistics are concerned, it's 30 tonnes a year over five years which should in principle make no difference," O'Connell added. In the 1970s, the IMF sold about 25 million ounces of gold with little impact on the market, analysts said. About 3,500 tonnes of gold are consumed annually. Nevertheless, U.S. investment funds have taken advantage of the market's shaky technical indicators and anxiety over the IMF sales to push down the price, analysts said. The other precious metals, which often take cues from movements in the gold price, were also on shaky ground. Platinum shed more than $3 overnight and fixed at a two-month low of $390 an ounce, despite the seasonal lull approaching an end. Platinum's slide was linked to weakness in its sister metal palladium, which tumbled to close to three-year lows on Wednesday, dealers said. Palladium, a rare white metal used in the auto and electronics industry, was trading slightly below Wednesday's levels at $122.00 an ounce. Silver traded just three cents lower at $5.08 an ounce, but dealers said it was vulnerable to tumbling below the key $5.00 an ounce level in the absence of buying interest.
GCAT	Syria's ruling coalition has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of endangering peace and security in the region and called for Arab and world action to force him to abandon his hardline policies. "Netanyahu's policies are threatening both peace and security...the international community should move to put an end to this aggressive policy," the central leadership of the National Progressive Front said in a statement following a meeting on Sunday night. The front, a coalition of parties led by the Baath party, said the meeting, chaired by Vice-President Zuheir Masharqa and attended by Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara, renewed Syria's commitment to make peace with Israel. But it stressed that any settlement of the conflict with the Jewish state should be based on the land-for-peace principle, a formula rejected by Netanyahu's government. "The meeting discussed the irresponsible policies of Netanyahu which constitute a setback for the peace process, a rebellion against the principles on which the peace process was based, and a flagrant challenge to the Arab nation," the front's statement said. "Arab solidarity should be achieved to counter these current challenges," it added. The Syrian central leadership described Netanyahu's policies as "aggressive" and said he was "trying to undermine the peace process and to return it to the zero point". Syria has held sporadic peace negotiations with Israel since 1967 but no talks have been held with Netanyahu's government since it took over in June. The official Syrian newspaper Tishreen said no peace talks would be held with Netanyahu until he approved a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967. "Netanyahu's false statements on resumption of talks without preconditions do not convince anyone. They are merely a stupid manoeuvre which will not deceive Arabs or the world," it said in a frontpage editorial by chief editor Mohammed Khair al-Wadi.
GCAT	South Africans Ernie Els and Wayne Westner romped to a record 18-shot World Cup victory on Sunday. They smashed the previous best winning margin of 14 strokes set by Ben Hogan and Sam Snead in 1956 and equalled by Fred Couples and Davis Love III in 1994 and 1995. World matchplay champion Els did not ease up even though the pair carried a 13-stroke advantage into the final round. He closed with a 67 to finish 16-under and also carried off the International Trophy as leading individual. Westner finished three back in second place after a 70. It was only the fifth occasion in the tournament's 42-year history that the winning team have staged a one-two in the individual rankings. South Africa also became only the seventh team to lead the event throughout. Low round of the tournament and final day was claimed by Ireland's Darren Clarke who shot a 64 despite a double bogey six at the 10th hole. The South Afriucan duo shared the $400,000 first prize with Els collecting an additional $100,000 for his individual success. "It's been an unbelievable week for me," Els said. "I have won one major but this comes very close to it. The feeling walking up the 18th was incredible -- to win a tournament like this playing in front of your home crowd in the way we did is really satisfying." Scotland were unable to hold off the challenge of the United States, finishing third on 10-under as Tom Lehman and Steve Jones improved by five shots on the final day to finish on 11-under. Els added: "We had to stay pretty focused today having such a big lead. Situations like this can change very rapidly." Westner said: "All we had to do today was play conservative golf but Ernie went ballistic again. I'm a bit older so I was more conservative. "It was an honour and a privilege to play with Ernie for four days -- there's no weakness in his game and he's so relaxed he makes it very easy."

GCAT	The Guatemalan Congress on Thursday named a new human rights ombudsman, a high-profile post in a country with one of the worst human rights records in the hemisphere. Julio Arango, a former judge and prosecutor, won 69 of 79 votes to become Guatemala's top watchdog for human rights and government corruption. On paper, the five-year position is a highly symbolic one, but those who have occupied it in the past have turned it into a bully pulpit, earning nicknames like "conscience of the nation" and "defender of the people." The post of human rights ombudsman was created in the mid-1980s by the country's first civilian leader in three decades. Then-President Vinicio Cerezo was under international pressure to clean up the country's dismal human rights record. Guatemala is emerging from a 36-year civil war between leftist guerrillas and powerful military. Its scorched-earth policies of the war years earned the wrath of human rights groups worldwide as many Indian villages were wiped off the map.
GCAT	Pope John Paul begins a bitter-sweet return to Poland on Saturday to review the lights and shadows of his homeland eight years after it became the first East Bloc country to cast off communism. The trip to 12 towns and cities in 11 days is in part a walk down memory lane for the Roman Catholic leader, who has suffered from a series of health problems in the last three years. Coming just two weeks after he marked his 77th birthday, the trip, the Pope's 78th abroad and the longest to a single country since he visited Brazil in 1991, will be a major test of his stamina. "Certainly it will be more difficult than five or 10 years ago but what can you expect from a man who still works hard and has already passed his 76th year," said Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, secretary of the Polish bishops' conference. Still, aides say few things invigorate the Pontiff more than visits to the land that shaped his destiny, and in turn that of the 960 million-member Catholic Church in the 20th century. "It is a return to the places that are most dear to him," Pieronek said. Vatican officials say that each time the Pope visits Poland he does so with the realisation that it could be his last. The final part of the trip is centred on Krakow, where the Pope lived out part of World War Two with his widowed father and where he was later to become bishop and cardinal. The most poignant momemt will most likely be a visit to his parents' graves in Krakow and the cathedral which he left in 1978, never dreaming he would be elected Pope. He will also visit the shrine of Czestochowa and again give thanks to the Madonna for saving his life in a 1981 shooting. Each of the Pope's six previous trips to Poland has struck deep political chords, most notably his first in 1979 which gave Poles a flush of pride while still in communism's grip. "The 1979 trip was like a reawakening," Father Adam Boniecki, former editor of the Polish edition of the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, said in a radio interview. "The communist state and its police aparatus deprived the people of their faith and of the possibility of real change. Before the arrival of the Pope freedom was won centimetre by centemetre. Afterwards, Polish society felt stronger and the march towards freedom began," Boniecki said. Historians have credited the Pope's unflagging support for the Solidarity trade union as a key factor in the domino fall of communism in the East Bloc. "There is no doubt that the Pope has always been a potent force in the Polish situation," Pieronek said. As he has on all of his trips to Poland since 1989, the Pope is expected to warn his countrymen not to allow the spoils of their post-communist freedom to be eroded by moral decay, materialism and budding anti-clericalism. "Poland still finds itself in the process of coming out of the long illness of socialism. Like any body that is weak, it catches fever easily from episodes that in other societies are a routine part of public life," Boniecki said As in other countries in the former Soviet Bloc, the breathless march of market forces since 1989 has left a wide gap between rich and poor and eroded communism's social safety net. "He will find Poles more divided and a little more lost because in the past few years there have been so many changes and not all of them are good for society," Pieronek said. This time it will not be Lech Walesa, the former Solidarity leader who became president, greeting the Pope on his arrival in Wroclaw on Saturday and seeing him off in Krakow on June 10. Former communists, who are now social democrats, have held the reins of government since 1993. President Aleksander Kwasniewski defeated Walesa in 1995. The Church, once a rallying point for anti-communist forces, has had a scratchy relationship with the government over issues such as abortion and a still unratified concordat treaty with the Vatican to regulate the Church's status. It was signed by the former government in 1993 but has since been delayed by leftists in parliament. On June 3 in Gniezno the Pope will meet the heads of state of seven eastern and central European countries visiting Poland for the 1,000th anniversary of the martyrdom of St Adalbert, who helped Christianise the East.
ECAT	Ivory Coast's Finance Minister Ngoran Niamien said in an interview published on Wednesday that his government and banks had failed to reach common ground in latest talks on rescheduling the country's $6 billion trade debt.   "The banks and ourselves have reached discord," Niamen told official daily Fraternite Matin, adding that the negotiations had been suspended until November. "The banks are demanding a restructuring which is vastly beyond our capacity to pay and we cannot accept that," he added. He gave no details of proposals by the London Club of creditor banks whose negotiators met the Ivorians in Washington last week on the sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual gathering.   An official source told Reuters in July that Ivory Coast had offered at talks in Paris in June to pay 128 billion CFA in 1996 and about 11 billion CFA yearly up to 2000. Its package works out to an average yearly repayment of 21.7 billion CFA between 1997 and 2010. In January banks had demanded 161 billion CFA for 1996 and an average of 148 billion CFA between 1997 and 2010. "Our capacity to pay has has been greatly reduced because, on top of the commercial bank debt, we have multilateral debts with the Paris Club (of official creditors), we have also internal debt," Niamen said. He said Ivory Coast's capacity to pay had not improved simply because it had good prospects of attracting foreign investors or because of the discovery of some oil in its offshore fields. This was only a gamble on the future. Ivory Coast has said it is a victim of its own economic succees: creditors think it can repay debts at any cost simply because of a rebound in its economy. "But I think that if we do not resolve the (debt) problem all our effort shall be in vain...If the debt problem is resolved, that will boost our investment promotion efforts, both as regards foreign investors as well as local," he said.

CCAT	Italy's Fiat said results for the first 10 months of 1996 were in line with its most recent forecasts, according to a company note issued after a group board meeting on Tuesday. Fiat has spoken of a difficult 1996 and its latest results for the nine months from January to September showed a pretax profit falling to 1.759 trillion lire from 2.743 trillion lire. But Fiat has said its fourth quarter will benefit from the sale of fund management arm Prime and the flotation of its stake in its farm machinery group New Holland. The statement added that Fiat is preparing to open at the end of this week new factories in Argentina and India. The Argentine plant will produce a booted version of Fiat's Palio "world" car already built in Brazil and, in India, it will see the opening of a Iveco-Hinduja joint venture plant for trucks. -- Milan newsroom +392 66129502

CCAT	The people behind "The Unexplained" have some explaining to do. This CD-ROM (FlagTower, Windows, $30), a recent example of someone trying to make a buck off the pseudo-mysteries of the "supernatural," invites you to "examine the evidence" and then neglects to provide key pieces of information to help you understand what's really going on. It talks about spoons supposedly bent by mental energy and a photograph allegedly created with thought waves, never explaining how such tricks are done by sleight of hand. One of my favourite supernatural topics is dowsing -- the alleged ability to find water, gold, missing persons, and just about anything using a forked stick, a couple of bent coat hangers, or a pendulum. The scientific research is overwhelming: it doesn't work. The psychology behind dowsing, particularly why people believe in it so fiercely, is fascinating. "The Unexplained" makes the dowsing issue seem far more open to debate than it really is. On the one hand, "The Unexplained" treats dowsing as real, stating at one point that the U.S. Marine Corps is "quite open about their use of the talent to detect dangerous sites," a highly questionable claim and one that the programme never bothers to document. In some cases, the folks at FlagTower do something that the supernatural TV special and tabloid talk shows don't do -- offer at least a smidgen of scepticism. The dowsing section, for example, describes a test by the British military where dowsers failed miserably when they tried to located defused mines. It also states that false memories, suggestibility, and hoaxes may be responsible for some UFO reports. There's a huge prize (currently over $740,000) for anyone who can demonstrate paranormal powers without using luck or fraud. (The challenge is outlined on the World Wide Web at www.randi.org/jr/chall.html.) A savvy consumer should question why none of the people on this CD-ROM who claim extraordinary powers have earned the money.     -   -   -   - From trepanation (the ancient practice of drilling holes in the head to cure headaches, epilepsy and mental illness) to organ transplants, FlagTower's "A History of Medicine" (Windows, $30) looks at the illnesses, discoveries and people who have shaped contemporary medicine. The presentation is entertaining and interesting. It has a section on the Hammurabi Code, which was the first attempt to regulate doctors and ordered that a surgeon who saved the life of a lord must be handsomely rewarded, unless the lord died (in which case his hand would be cut). This early form of managed care prevented a lot of unnecessary operations. Another section explains how the Hebrews pioneered the science of public health with their sanitation rules. Unfortunately, "A History of Medicine" falls for much of the propaganda surrounding "alternative" medicine, stating that practitioners who use "complementary" therapies "stress that disorders are not the product of a single cause but an accumulation of factors: inherited predispositions, diet, emotional state, an individual's way of life and abuses such as alcohol and cigarettes." The truth is, that's the underlying philosophy of "established" medicine these days. Yet though the programme seems unwilling to assess questionable medical claims, it offers a nice discussion of medical quackery. "A History of Medicine" ends up being a mixed bag. If you're going to embrace its information in large doses, I prescribe a grain of salt.     -   -   -   - Some new and notable software in the stores this week: "Rama" (Sierra, Windows95/DOS, $55) is based on the series of novels originated by science fiction author Arthur C.

CCAT	Shoney's Inc said Monday that it had settled with a group led by Raymond Schoenbaum, the son of the franchise founder, regarding a pending proxy contest to replace the company's board. In the settlement agreement, Shoney's said it agreed to increase the number of directors to 11 from seven. Schoenbaum and Michael Bodner have been added to the board, it said.   One additional director selected from the Schoenbaum group's slate of nominees will be added within two weeks and a fourth director mutually acceptable to both sides will be added as soon as practicable or within 60 days, it said. Shoneys said it also agreed that new directors will be nominated to the board at the next annual meeting. As part of the settlement, the Schoenbaum group agreed to withdraw its request for a special meeting and terminate its proxy drive, Shoney's said. In addition, the group agreed to a standstil provision prohibiting certain actions, including launching a new proxy contest, until April 30, 1998, subject to certain exceptions, it said.
ECAT	The Group of Seven is expected to back at this week's summit a broad commitment to promote sustainable economic growth and avoid excessive trade imbalances, a US Treasury official said on Tuesday. Treasury Assistant Secretaty David Lipton told reporters that the commitment woud be a general statement, indicating that it would not single out any country, including Japan.   "We expect that you'll see an endorsement of a broad commitment among the G7 to pursue policies to promote sustainable growth and avoid excessive external imbalances," Lipton said. President Clinton is expected to discuss the need for Japan to maintain strong domestic demand-led growth and avoid an unhealthy rise in its trade surplus when he meets his Japanese counterpart in Denver, Lipton said. "This is a subject that will be discussed," he said. Lipton touted America's economic success, calling economic conditions here the best in the industrial world.   By bringing down the budget deficit, the Clinton administration paved the way for lower U.S. interest rates and a strong dollar that have contributed to America's economic vigor, Lipton said. "The steps that have been taken during the course of the Clinton administration to bring down the budget deficit have led to lower interest rates and a strong dollar and have all contributed to ... a strong economy," Lipton said. "While economic performance in the United States has been strong," he added, "in many regions growth prospects are not so bright." Lipton said he expects Europe's plans to forge a single currency to be discussed at the June 20-22 summit in Denver. "The U.S. wants monetary union to proceed in a way that supports growth and stability in the region," he added. The G7 summit will bring together the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Russian President Boris Yeltsin is also slated to attend all but one of the summit's meetings. (( --Washington newsroom, 202-898-8377 ))
MCAT	Crude prices in the U.S. Gulf remained weaker in Monday afternoon activity, while cash grade differentials steadied at slightly easier levels. August West Texas Intermediate/Cushing talked around 10-15 cents weaker at $19.10-20 a barrel, also working lower against the September contract, leaving Aug/Sep spreads at -23 cents. Cash dealers were not thrilled with volume levels for grade barrels, but parcels have moved for Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James, West Texas Sour and Postings. "It looks like that more than anything fundamental, there are people in the market looking to shed some length," said a trader in the Gulf. LLS/St. James remained at a 20-22 cents premium to August WTI/Cushing, steady from Friday. Midland barrels edged out to talk at 25-27 cents below the marker, while Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire hovered at 25 cents below level. Cash prices softened for WTS, with barrels switching hands at $1.25-27 under August WTI/Cushing. Traders saw two significant bullish factors erased from the market on Monday, and one bearish issue heighten. First, Iraq officially handed over their aid distribution to the United Nations leadership on Monday, setting in motion what should be the final steps for implementing "oil-for-food" accord oil sales. Once Secretary-General Kofi Annan approves the plan, all that is left before sales can resume is submission of a new pricing formula for basing Iraqi contracts with lifters. The bullish issues eliminated include the passing of Hurricane Danny through the U.S. Gulf without major damage inflicted on the U.S. refining and production belt. Buying was seen ahead of the storm in case refineries or production platforms were disabled and caused a near-term supply squeeze. Lastly, the strength sour crude barrels assumed last week faded as Cano Limon production returned to normal in Colombia. Rebel attacks on the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline forced Cano output cuts and force majeure declarations. ((--Patrick Connole, NY Energy Desk, +1 212 859 1828))
ECAT	China's central People's Bank of China has set the interest rate subsidy on deposits of three years or more at 3.72 percent, the China Securities newspaper said on Monday.   It gave no further details. The subsidy compared with 4.04 percent in November, 3.62 percent in October and 3.61 percent in September. China said in March it would stop paying interest rate subsidies on new deposits of three years and above from April 1 as inflation eased. Falling inflation would enable China to stop paying the subsidy by end-1996 or early next year, state media has said. Such subsidies would continue to be paid on fixed deposits made before April 1. Retail price inflation was a year-on-year 4.7 percent in October and 6.4 percent in the first 10 months of this year.
CCAT	Sony Corp said Sunday that Sony Electronics Inc will install the infrastructure for a digital broadcast system for the CBS television network to produce the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan.

The system will consist of two production studios, nine edit bays and more than 60 Sony digital recorders, the company said. Sony had been chosen by Westinghouse Electric Corp's CBS to integrate broadcast systems during the 1992 and 1994 Winter Games also, a release from Sony said.
ECAT	Canada's central bank governor switched gears on Thursday, saying the bank has moved to a more neutral strategy on monetary policy -- a sharp change from his stimulative approach of the past year. Until now, the Bank of Canada has kept monetary conditions loose by lowering key interest rates many times in the past year in hopes of stimulating the sluggish Canadian economy. But on Thursday, central bank Gov. Gordon Thiessen said the Canadian economy was poised to grow by about 4 percent in 1997 and that inflation was almost non-existent, giving the bank leeway to stop lowering rates. "What we see is a need to move from stimulative monetary conditions to a setting which is more neutral," Thiessen told a news conference after releasing the bank's semi-annual Monetary Policy Report. "Monetary policy in Canada has shifted," Michael Gregory, strategist for Lehman Brothers in Toronto, said in a phone interview. "What they're doing is removing ease. This is a sea change right now." The Canadian dollar and bond markets rallied on Thiessen's comments. In the hour after his remarks, the 30-year benchmark bond rose C13 cents to C$111.18 to yield 7.056 percent, while the Canadian dollar strengthened to C$1.3752 (72.72 cents) from Wednesday's close at C$1.3893 (71.98 cents). Canada's currency has been volatile since the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates in March and the Bank of Canada did not follow suit. With the Bank of Canada now showing a willingness to raise rates, "it allows the market to focus on our bullish fundamentals," said Rob Palombi, senior fixed-income analyst with MMS International in Toronto. Thiessen predicted more strength in the currency over the long term. While Thiessen's comments prompted immediate market predictions of rising rates in the coming months, Thiessen said any rate hike would likely be small. Although he was enthusiastic about the prospects for the Canadian economy, Thiessen said demand was well below capacity and that the size of Canada's debt compared to gross domestic product still needed to come down. The bank said slack in the Canadian economy was still significant, but was shrinking. In its report, the bank said the gap between actual production and the capacity to produce narrowed to 2.5 percent by the end of 1996, down from 3 percent earlier in the year. "Our view is it will continue to narrow ... this year and next, we believe," Thiessen said. "What we're looking for is to essentially eliminate that gap over time and to bring the economy back to a rate of full capacity utilization." Canada's high unemployment rate of 9.6 percent is linked to the slack in the economy, but there were signs employment was also improving, Thiessen said.

GCAT	Regional governors backed by President Boris Yeltsin took a narrow lead in local elections on Sunday and the brother of maverick politician Alexander Lebed won the poll in a district of Western Siberia. But communist leader Gennady Zyuganov insisted on Monday that the results were "a complete success" for the opposition. The results, published by Russian news agencies on Monday, showed that Kremlin appointees took the governorships in six of the 15 regions holding such polls. Two other Kremlin appointees will be favourites in second round votes. Candidates from the communist-led Union of National and Patriotic Forces, which groups communists and other opposition forces won in four regions and were strong in two where run-off votes were due. The Kremlin and the opposition have each claimed success in previous regional elections, which select local governors who then sit on the Federation Council upper house of parliament. Zyuganov told a news conference that the opposition would be able to expand its national power base as a result of its gains in recent weeks. The opposition, which already dominates the State Duma lower house, has said it is close to winning control over the Federation Council. But the Kremlin says most of the newly elected governors are either government supporters or, at the least, are not hardline opponents. Presidential chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais has said he wants a pragmatic, apolitical cooperation with the regions. Several communist-backed new governors have appeared on platforms with officials from Chubais's Kremlin administration, pledging their willingness to work with the government. One independent candidate was elected in Khakassia in Western Siberia, where voters chose independent Alexei Lebed, the brother of former Security Council secretary Alexander Lebed, in a run-off. Kremlin officials said earlier this month that Alexei Lebed had a "constructive position". Yeltsin sacked Alexander Lebed in October, accusing him of harbouring presidential ambitions and splitting the Kremlin team. In the vast but thinly populated diamond-rich republic of Yakutia, reformist incumbent president Mikhail Nikolayev was re-elected in a runoff vote. Governors directly appointed by Yeltsin won in the Arctic Arkhangelsk region, in Chukotka across the Bering Strait from Alaska, in Taimyr in Siberia, Perm in the Urals and the Volga region Ulyanovsk. Opposition candidates won in central Russia's Kostroma and Ryazan regions, in Chelyabinsk in the Urals, and in the fertile agricultural region of Krasnodar in southern Russia. A total of 55 regional polls have been held so far and 41 governors have been elected.
GCAT	Two goals in two minutes late in the game gave champions Manchester United a 2-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur in their English premier league season-opener on Sunday. The match appeared to be heading for a goalless draw after United's Teddy Sheringham missed a 60th minute penalty against his old club. But eight minutes from time the 3.5 million pounds ($5.6 million) England man had a shot charged down by Ramon Vega and the ball ran to an unmarked Nicky Butt who slammed it past Spurs keeper Ian Walker from six metres. Less than two minutes later it was 2-0 as Swiss international Vega deflected a harmless David Beckham cross into his own net. United deserved the points from a game short of goalmouth action, dominated by both sets of defenders. It looked to be going the champions' way after an hour when Spurs defender Justin Edinburgh handled in the box as he attempted to tackle Jordi Cruyff. Sheringham, signed from Spurs over the summer to fill the gaping boots of now retired French forward Eric Cantona, stepped up to take the spot kick but sent his shot against a post. It was the first real chance of the match -- there were only three shots on target in the first half -- despite the sparkling array of striking talent on display. Tottenham's new summer signings from Newcastle -- Frenchman David Ginola and England striker Les Ferdinand -- made their debuts for Spurs, who gave promising teenage midfielder Stephen Clemence, son of former England goalkeeper Ray, his official first team debut. Ferdinand had one of Tottenham's few chances when United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel fluffed a clearance, the ball blocked by the Tottenham man's outstretched leg and rebounding high into the air. If Ferdinand had been a fraction faster he might have beaten the tall Schmeichel to the ball but the Dane safely gathered it and the danger passed. ($ = 0.629 British Pounds)

"We didn't discuss that," Chile's President Eduardo Frei said at a joint news conference with Bolivia's President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada when reporters asked about Bolivia's demand that Chile give it a sea outlet. Bolivia has sought access to the Pacific Ocean ever since losing its westernmost territory in a war with Chile in 1879. Frei said no timetable had been set for restoring bilateral ties, severed by La Paz in 1978 after talks aimed at giving Bolivia access to the sea through a territorial exchange failed to yield concrete results. Sanchez de Lozada said he hoped small steps forward in ties with Chile would eventually lead to the restoration of full diplomatic relations. The two leaders held a one-hour meeting in this central Bolivian city, where they plan to attend the 10th presidential summit of the Rio Group of 14 Latin American nations on Tuesday and Wednesday.
ECAT	Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director for the International Monetary Fund, on Friday urged central banks to set specific targets for inflation, saying a rate of 1-3 percent would be an optimal goal for major industrialized nations. "For an industrialized country that has already attained single-digit inflation, it is best to target a rate in the range of 1 to 3 percent," Fischer said in a paper prepared for delivery at a symposium here.   The theme of the symposium, an annual event sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, is "Achieving Price Stability." Pointing to numerous studies showing that inflation, particularly at very high levels, impedes long-run growth, Fischer said the evidence argues for policies that foster  low inflation. Yet he said that for a number of reasons, including measurement problems, he would not advise aiming for zero inflation.   Fischer noted that the key inflation gauges in major industrial nations, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, are believed to overstate true inflation by around 0.5 percentage point a year. In the United States, some experts have estimated the upward bias could be in the range of 1 to 2 percentage points. Thus, he said, targeting zero inflation could end up resulting in actual deflation. Both zero inflation and a deflation situation would pose complications for monetary policy as it could mean that a negative real interest rate might be needed in circumstances such as a recession, he said.   "If the expected inflation rate is zero, then it is very difficult for monetary policy to engineer a negative short-run interest rate," Fischer said. "The serious constraints placed on monetary policy in a zero-inflation or deflationary environment have recently been evident in Japan," he added. An inflation target of around 2 percent or a range of 1 to 3 percent is "in practice" what most central banks mean when they talk of price stability, Fischer said.   Explaining why he felt it was important to set a specific target for inflation, Fischer said it would help central bankers avoid a dilemma in which their rhetoric on inflation does not always match their actions. That situation can arise when central bankers talk of the need to focus on price stability as the sole goal of monetary policy but then undermine the credibility of their statements when the undertake countercyclical policies such as when their economies are in recession, he said. "Once there is an explicit numerical inflation target for monetary policy, and a transparent framework for making policy and holding policymakers accountable for their actions, it is not possible to overlook the potential inflationary consequences of monetary expansion undertaken for short-term countercyclical purposes," Fischer said. While pointing out that the sustained low inflation of industrial nations has had a "remarkable" impact on diminishing peoples' concerns about inflation, he said those nations still have yet to fully achieve price stability. "Periodic alarums in the capital market when the economy expands too fast reveal that we are not yet there," he said.
MCAT	Fuel oil tumbled on Friday with easier crude, the ending of the strike at Elf's three French refineries and the prospect of American fuel flooding the European market. Up to $4 was shaved off high sulphur cargo prices and low sulphur was off about $2. Traders said the sharp drop in high sulphur cracked prices reflected a lack of fundamental strength. "It was closely tied in with crude and also a bit by the Elf strike and they have both gone," said one trader. A cargo was heard sold into a utility at $119 cif NWE, $4 off a similar deal done on Thursday. Two coking units in the U.S are also off-line, one of which will be out for three weeks maintenance. Up to 165,000 tonnes of fuel will have to find an alternative home and a large parcel over 50,000 tonnes is expected to head into ARA. Dealers said the arbitrage is open from the U.S. into Europe and some are bracing themselves for the extra product.

GCAT	Former president F.W. de Klerk addresses South Africa's "truth commission" on Wednesday in a bid to explain why his National Party plunged the country into 46 years of apartheid misery. De Klerk, who acknowledged in 1990 that South Africa's race policies were untenable and began reforms that led to majority rule four years later, will present his party's overview of apartheid to Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commssion. He said this week the presentation would take the long view, starting with the 1652 arrival of the Dutch ancestors of today's Afrikaners in Cape Town, site of the truth commission hearing. "I'm looking forward to the opportunity to...put what happened from our vantage point in the proper context," de Klerk said. "Part of that will also be to accept overall responsibility for many things which went wrong." Since it began work in April, Tutu's commission has heard a lengthy litany of what went wrong, ranging from torture to police hit-squad killings and burning tyre "necklace" murders. Harrowing testimony has been given by black survivors of the white minority government's campaign against the African National Congress -- which under President Nelson Mandela now rules the country -- and other liberation movements. But on Monday the commission heard bitter criticism of the National Party, which implemented apartheid in 1948, from de Klerk's fellow-Afrikaner, General Constand Viljoen. Viljoen, a former defence force chief who heads a right-wing party pressing for Afrikaner self-determination, began the series of party submissions to the commission by saying apartheid's foot soldiers should not get all the blame. "It is unfair that the operators be exposed as the chief perpetrators of atrocities when the politicians and strategy managers hide behind their status and positions," he said. "The masterminds behind this crucible of past iniquities more than anybody else should account for their schemes even if that brings political embarrassment to their parties today." De Klerk, who jointly won the Nobel peace prize with Mandela in 1993, is now trying to position his party as a credible opposition to the ANC, repeatedly disowning its past as the whites-only architect of apartheid. Most of the leaders of the party today are relative moderates while such apartheid stalwarts as Hendrik Verwoerd, John Vorster and P.W. Botha are dead or deep in retirement. Mandela's government set up the truth commission in the belief that it could heal the wounds of apartheid by exposing as full a picture as possible of the crimes and atrocities committed by all sides.

MCAT	The Mexican peso closed weaker across the board on Wednesday after zigzagging through the session ahead of the forthcoming long weekend, traders said. "There was no major news. The peso opened under pressure, but suddenly some banks stepped in to sell dollars and the pressure eased a little," a trader said. "They probably wanted to take advantage of the long weekend and good levels at which to sell this morning," he added, referring to returns available on peso instruments over the forthcoming four-day weekend.   The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate closed 0.5 and 1.8 centavos weaker, respectively, at 7.8950/7.9000 and 7.8910/7.8960 per dollar. Same-day peso contracts had closed earlier 2.2 centavos weaker at 7.8800/7.8930 per dollar. Mexican financial markets will be closed on Thursday and Friday for Easter holidays. Traders said the peso had opened weaker under pressure from the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond, which was down 9/32 to yield 6.99 percent. "It was a strange market. The peso suddenly moderated its slide and ignored the U.S. long bond, even though it was down," another trader said. ((-- Patricia Lezama, Mexico City newsroom +525 728-9555))

CCAT	Taiwan's financial shares, led by the "big three" state-run banks, surged at mid-morning on Monday as the sector left electronics its wake as the market's trendsetting sector, brokers said. After 75 minutes, at 0215 GMT, financials were up 4.99 percent, while the overall index was up 1.02 percent -- and the electronics was down 4.73 percent on profit-taking. The big three state banks -- Chang Hwa Bank, First Commercial Bank and Hua Nan Bank -- all were up the daily seven percent limit to T$133, T$134.5 and T$135, respectively.   "Sentiment is quite bullish," said Golden Securities analyst Albert Lin. "Though electronics are suffering a correction, financials have emerged to lead the overall upward momentum." Lin said buying focus had turned to financials as the sector had been consolidating in recent weeks during a dazzling bull run by electronics that led the overall index sharply higher. Brokers said they expected the big three banks' planned privatisation to accelerate now that the constitutional assembly has completed amendments that will all but phase out their principal owner -- the Taiwan provincial government.   In late May, the government announced a 12-18 month plan to release 15.9 percent of First Commercial's shares, 7.5 percent of Hua Nan's and 4.65 percent of Chang Hwa's. After the offer, the government stakes in the big three would drop to below 50 percent, with the bulk of shares falling into private hands. "Now that the constitutional reform is completed, many think the government will speed up the privatisation of the big three banks, a move that will increase operational efficiency of the three banks in the long term," Lin said. -- Taipei newsroom (886-2-5080815)
GCAT	England manager Jack Rowell found himself without a team to coach on Wednesday when the 43-strong international squad carried out their threat to boycott the first training session of the new season. Only a handful of officials were present at Bisham Abbey near London when Rowell drove into the training ground with no players in sight. Instead the squad will attend a meeting called by the English Professional Rugby Union Clubs (EPRUC) to discuss the current contract war. The players' Rugby Football Union contracts expired at the weekend and the EPRUC, who plan to split from the union and run their own competitions, have taken the initiative. The clubs, who are currently the players' sole employers, want more money and power in the new professional era and have declared they will set up as an independent organisation in October. England also face expulsion from the Five Nations' championship next Monday after a row over television revenue.
MCAT	Bank shares steamed ahead "in healthy trade" on the Beirut Stock Exchange during the week ending on Friday and brokers said the stocks were expected to rise further. "The trend will stay up because the banks' fundamentals are very good," Nicholas Sawan, Deputy Manager head of tranding at Beirut finance house Lebanon Invest said. Banque Audi touched an alltime high of $23.125 on Friday from $23 last week. It fell on Tuesday to $22.25 only to pick up again towards the end of the week. "An important point to stress is the fact that the shares have been able to go up and down in the past two weeks," Sawan told Reuters. "Market makers are becoming flexible enough to allow the shares to fluctuate naturally. This is a healthy sign," he said. Banque Libanaise pour Le Commerce touched during the week a record $17.75. It fell back to $17.625 on Friday, well above last week's closing at $16.5. Bank of Beirut rose to $3.6875 from $3.5625 last week. Four block trades totalling 75,000 shares traded at between $3.5625 and $3.6875 on the floor. A little less than 60,000 Audi shares were traded in a block at $22.25 on the BSE during the week. A block of 30,000 shares traded at $22.25 off the floor. Seven BLC block trades totalling 42,500 shares traded on the BSE during the week at prices ranging between $16.75 and $17.625. One block of 15,000 shares traded off the bourse. The LIBX bank index rose 3.59 percent on the week to 149.13. The LISPI general index fell 0.13 percent to 88.42 while the BLOM general index rose 0.04 percent to 930.88. Solidere shares were unchanged from last week. A traded at $10.5 on Friday while B shares traded at $10.75. Demand for the shares was strengthening throughout the week and brokers said the stock was expected to rise next week. "It's logical. Downside is limited, almost nonexistent for Solidere now," Sawan said. Of the four industrial shares, pipemaker Eternit fell to $1.9375 from $2 while Ciments Libanais was unchanged at $1.28125. Ciments Blancs, which last traded on Thursday at $4.75 was down from $5.1875 a week earlier. There was no trade in either tilemaker Uniceramic throughout the week.

GCAT	Jim Furyk birdied the 18th hole on Thursday to grab a one shot lead in the suspended first round of the $1.8 million Byron Nelson Classic golf tournament. Furyk's eighth birdie of the round allowed him to finish at 7-under-par 63, one shot better than three golfers, including Masters champion Tiger Woods. Woods, playing for the first time since his victory at Augusta, was tied for second place with Dudley Hart and Paul Stankowski. Woods was looking for his third win of the year and Stankowski his second. Play was delayed by lightning for three hours, 40 minutes, but all but three players completed their rounds before play was suspended. Four straight birdies from holes seven through 10 highlighted Furyk's round. After a pair of six-foot putts on the seventh and eighth, he rolled in a 15-footer on the par-3 ninth hole to finish the front nine at 4-under 30.  He opened the back side with an eightfooter on the 10th hole. "I jumped right into the flow today," Furyk said.  "It's nice to get off to a good start." Furyk, playing the Cottonwood Valley Course, added back-to-back birdies on 12 and 13 before his only bogey of the round on the 14th. His other birdie of the round was at the second hole. The bigger crowds were at the Tournament Players Course, where Woods started fast, with a birdie on the first hole before four straight birdies beginning at the fifth hole.  He carded a 30 on the front side. "I was just hoping for a round under par -- I was pretty nervous," he said. "It was nice to feel the juices flowing. The front nine was more than I could have hoped for." But after nailing a 30-footer for birdie on 10, Woods bogeyed 11 and 12 to fall back to 4-under.  He recovered with birdies on the 16th and 18th holes. Stankowski, who beat Furyk in a playoff to win the Hawaiian Open in February, matched Woods at the Tournament Course, birdying the first two holes and five of the first nine. He added a pair of birdies and a bogey on the back side. Tom Watson, the last Tour player to win the same event three straight years when he won here from 1978-80, was among a group of six golfers at 5-under 65. Ten golfers are three shots back with 66s, including defending champion Phil Mickelson, Nick Faldo and Ben Crenshaw.
GCAT	The Pentagon said on Tuesday that at least 15,000 and perhaps far more U.S. Gulf War veterans might have been exposed to chemical weapons in the destruction of an Iraqi ammunition dump five years ago. Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon also told reporters that the prestigious private National Academy of Sciences had agreed to a request to study the department's controversial handling of "Gulf War illness." The Pentagon said two weeks ago that it was notifying 5,000 U.S. troops that they might have been exposed to Sarin nerve gas when chemical rockets and shells were blown up at the Kamisiyah ammunition depot in southern Iraq in March 1991. "I think we have to think in terms of big numbers. Bigger than 15,000, certainly," Bacon said on Tuesday when pressed by reporters on whether that number could grow significantly. Published reports suggested in recent weeks that more than 100,000 U.S. troops from several divisions might have been exposed to fallout from a massive white cloud from the explosion. The issue, in which the Pentagon denied ignoring complaints of veterans or trying to cover up information, has become a major military and political controversy. "I don't think anybody will know what an accurate figure is until after the model is run," Bacon said of a sophisticated computer estimate being prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency on how big the blast cloud might have been and where it went. "Even then it will be a technological estimate.  It will be a computer estimate based on a reconstruction of weather patterns and other assumptions about a day in 1991," he said. The U.S. government, on orders from President Bill Clinton, last year mounted a major effort to resolve medical complaints from as many as 60,000 U.S. Gulf War veterans. The complaints ranged from numbness to memory loss, but no common cause or so-called Gulf War illness was found . An announcement by the department two weeks ago saying that 5,000 troops would be notified had already vastly expanded the search for possible victims after the military said in June that only 150 U.S. troops could have suffered exposure as they destroyed the weapons. Initial reports in June indicated that only a small number of troops from a U.S. engineering battalion were involved in destroying weapons in a bunker, but the new report included a pit several miles (kilometers) from the bunker. Bacon said on Tuesday that Deputy Defence Secretary John White asked the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the academy, to evaluate the department's "overall approach to the Gulf War illness -- both its treatment patterns as well as the way we're assembling information." "They will actually undertake two projects," he said. "The first project is to review our approach, and the second is to look into the future and to advise us on a long-term strategy for protecting the health of military personnel deployed in unfamiliar environments." "This would involve environments including all sorts of possible toxins, including chemical and biological weapons but perhaps environmental or other toxins that they might encounter as well," Bacon said. The Pentagon denied in August that it intentionally quashed a 1991 classified report suggesting that U.S. troops were exposed to Iraqi chemical weapons. But it conceded that "the full relevance of the report ... was not recognised at the time" and it was not investigated until this year, providing indications that soldiers were exposed to chemical agents when they blew up the Kamisiyah site.
MCAT	Traders said they expected the spread with Spain in the 10-year cash to remain slightly above five basis points on Wednesday after a session in which foreign markets set the tone for Portuguese paper. Traders said that Spain would continue to lead the way. Trade in the 10-year sector had been highly technical although the narrowing of the spread with the bunds to record lows below 120 basis points had attracted some profit-taking. The short to medium end remains well-supported despite the fact that few expect the Bank of Portugal to cut rates Wednesday at the start of the new commercial bank reserve period.   Trade was likely to be quiet in the morning as investors awaited U.S. producer price data, dealers said. Resistance for the December futures was put at 107.00, while support would come in at 106.25. --Sergio Goncalves, Lisbon bureau 3511-3150035
MCAT	LONDON, July 4 (Reuter) The dollar retreated, slipping to its lowest levels in a week against the yen, after Thursday's June U.S. jobs report dampened expectations of a rise in U.S. interest rates in the near future. The report showed the U.S. jobless rate rose to 5 percent in June from a near 24-year low of 4.8 percent in May, and that the pace of job creation in the private sector slowed. "The dollar is slipping primarily in the wake of the payrolls data," said Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB. Dollar/yen, which earlier fell as low as 113.24, was at 113.24/29 at 0730 GMT from 113.42/52 late on Thursday in Europe.
GCAT	Kashmiri separatist guerrillas on Tuesday rejected Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's offer for talks to end a seven-year-old separatist insurgency in the Himalayan region. "We reject the offer of talks because Gujral's offer is for only the misguided youth of Kashmir and we are not misguided, we are fighting for a sacred cause, for the freedom of Kashmir," the Shoura-e-Jihad guerrilla alliance said in a statement published in local newspapers. Gujral offered on Saturday to hold unconditional talks with "the misled youth of Kashmir" to end the revolt in Kashmir. On Sunday, he said the guerrillas must lay down their arms first. "I have always been willing to talk to the young boys who are our own children like in a family," he told parliament on Monday. The Shoura-e-Jihad (Advisory Council for Holy War) is a coalition of six major separatist groups fighting for Kashmir's merger with neighbouring Islamic Pakistan. Three other rebel groups are fighting for Kashmir's independence from both India and Pakistan. New Delhi controls two thirds of the territory and Pakistan the rest. India is mostly Hindu while the province has a Moslem majority. "Talks on Kashmir are only possible when Shoura-e-Jihad and Hurriyat agree to it," the guerrilla alliance said. The All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, which bands some 30 separatist, political and religious groups, said on Monday it wanted to be included in talks between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. Talks between the two archrivals resumed in March after three years of tense silence. The next set of negotiations, which follows talks between Gujral and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in May and a second round of lower level discussions, is scheduled for September. Both India and Pakistan, who have fought two wars over Kashmir since 1947, claim the entire region. Islamabad denies New Delhi's charges that it arms the separatist rebels, and says it provides only diplomatic and moral support to the insurgents. Police and hospitals say more than 20,000 people have been killed since the rebellion erupted.
ECAT	Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, said on Thursday that the outlook for low inflation was largely unchanged although it lifted its consumer price index forecasts made in March. In a quarterly inflation report, the bank said the underlying rate of inflation in 1997 and 1998 was estimated to be between 1.5-2.0 percent.   However, the bank said the annual rate of CPI inflation would be about one percent in 1997 and two percent for 1998 which was higher than forecasts of 0.5 percent and under two percent respectively in its March report. "This is mainly due to the recent months' weakening of the exchange rate but it also has to do with Statistics Sweden's revised calculations of the CPI item 'house mortgage interest costs'," the Riksbank said in the report. Statistics Sweden has changed its CPI to include cost for home owners renewing their loans. But the Riksbank said the rate of increase in both the CPI and underlying inflation in the coming two years was expected to be in line with the two percent inflation target. "With this assessment of the outlook for inflation the monetary stance is well balanced," the Riksbank said. The Riksbank's estimates for Gross Domestic Product remained unchanged. In round figures, the bank expects GDP to rise two percent in 1997 and three percent in 1998. "The output gap is not expected to close in the coming two years," the bank said.   However, the bank did say that the trend of falling inflation was now probably at an end. "Inflationary pressure in the Swedish economy is still limited but the latest developments shows that the trend of falling inflation is probably ended," the bank said. The Riksbank repeated that it has no intention of lowering its key interest rate, the repo rate, that currently stands at 4.10 percent. The repo was cut 25 times in 1996 and was last lowered on December 17. Its other key interest rates, the deposit and lending rates, are currently at 3.75 percent and 5.25 percent. -- Belinda Goldsmith, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1017
GCAT	About 100 employees of the mayor's office in Delmas, a suburb of the capital, rioted in the streets on Tuesday, saying they had not been paid in months and could not afford Christmas celebrations. The employeees were joined by other frustrated poor people, who turned against Christmas shoppers in the area. The mob took over about five square blocks, setting big fires in the streets, throwing rocks and menacing shoppers. Witnesses reported that a group of young men with guns had threatened security guards outside a bank. "It is Christmas but not for us because we don't have any money," one protester shouted. "We are tired of the rich people taking everything for themselves." The riot caused local panic. Drivers of tap-taps, pickup trucks that provide the main public transportation, forced passengers out rather than drive through the chaos. Shoppers pushed into nearby stores to take cover. There were no reports of injuries by midafternoon, after police and United Nations peacekeeping troops ended the disturbance and put out the fires. Growing numbers of public employees have been demonstrating since the bankrupt government has not paid salaries for months or years. But hundreds of thousands of dollars are expected in Haiti through loans and gifts from international donors now that the government has approved a plan to privatise important businesses.
CCAT	Vietnam's Ministry of Transport is considering plans to build a special rice port in the Can Gio district of Ho Chi Minh City, the official Ha Noi Moi daily said on Saturday. It said the $20 million port, which would have capacity to handle 3.75 million tonnes of rice a year, would include a special area for processing and storage. Major roads link the southern city to the country's main rice-growing area, the Mekong Delta. Vietnam was the world's fourth largest exporter of rice last year, selling 2.025 million tonnes abroad. In the first eight months of this year it exported 1.9 million tonnes. The Ministry of Agriculture has asked the government to sanction an increase in this year's export quota to 2.3-2.5 million tonnes from 2.0 million. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) told Reuters last month that Vietnam could earn $40-50 million a year more from selling rice abroad if it improved market management and liberalised its export regime.
GCAT	WARNING OF CUT BACKS TO FAMILY COURT BUDGET The Federal Opposition says cutbacks to the family court budget are being felt hardest in regional areas. Spokesman for Justice and Attorney General, Senator Nick Bolkus, says backlogs are building in north Queensland where the cuts have meant a loss of four weeks court time. Senator Bolkus says the lack of access is compounded by the long distances to courts and the additional expense of legal representation in the regions. He says there are stories of some people not being able to take their partners to court, and people with intellectual disabilities having to represent themselves. - - - - PORT ARTHUR VICTIMS TO KNOW SOON ON COMPENSATION Victims of the Port Arthur shootings should know early next month how much compensation they'll receive from the national appeal.

ECAT	The Tunisian treasury on Tuesday said it has raised 3.0 million dinars from January's issue of treasury bonds negotiable at the bourse (BTNB). It said it has sold ten-year paper payable in equal annual tranches worth 3.0 million dinars at a 9.0 percent coupon rate. Bids amounted to 36 million dinars for five-, ten- and 15-year paper at between 8.7500 and 12.5 percent. BTNB are issued each month on the first Tuesday. ($= one dinar) - Tunis newsroom, 2161-787538
MCAT	CME live cattle futures erased early gains and retreated for a net loss in April before ending with small gains as commercial hedging interest continued to weigh on futures and offset a sharp rebound from Wednesday's "mad cow" scare, traders said. Live cattle closed 0.425 cent higher to unchanged with June up 0.375 at 64.275 cents. Feeder cattle ended 0.325 to 0.850 higher with May up 0.625 at 70.850 cents. Live cattle slipped as further commercial hedging interest offset the early retracement of Wednesday's bovine spongiform encphalopathy (BSE) scare, traders said. Live cattle futures shot up at the start on what was considered an overreation Wednesday to the rumor of an Indiana rose grower dying from Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a human version of BSE. There was no evidence to point to any connection with the U.S. cattle herd, which is BSE free, and the insinuation that the dead man may have had gotten CJD from using bone meal fertilizer, traders said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said they do not believe there is any link from using bone meal fertilizer and BSE, sometimes called "mad cow disease" in Britian, and the man possibly dying from CJD.   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also said that deaths in the U.S. from CJD were rare and not known to be linked to "mad cow" disease. However, futures slipped as commercial hedging resumed following the initial bulge in futures prices. Traders noted that commercials had been sellers before the CJD story fully influenced the market as they resumed their hedging in anticipation of a seasonal break in prices. "From a trend standpoint, with some of the tops in the cattle at $70, cash has reached its peak yesterday," said Jason Roose, livestock analyst for U.S. Commodities Inc. On-feed cattle supplies are large and marketings are seen increasing into the summer. Friday's monthly USDA Cattle-on-Feed report is expected to confirm the larger than year ago on-feed numbers, they said. Estimates for seven-state major feedlots on feed averaged 107.6 percent and ranged from 106 to 108 percent of last year. Placements averaged 103.3 percent and ranged from 100.5 to 107 percent and marketings averaged 100.6 percent and ranged from 98 to 104.5 percent. Feeder cattle futures followed the lead of live cattle at times, but showed late stength on strong cash ideas. Cash feeders are seen showing strength into May and feed costs are expected to trend lower overall. The index has been hovering in the $70.50 to $71.00 area and is still expected to rise further, they said. Local short covering and buying by LFG supported May against selling by ABN Chicogo Corp and Refco and spreading of long August/short May by Cargill Investor Services. Cargill also spread long August and October feeders/short February live cattle, pit sources said. The latest CME feeder cattle index was off $0.06 at $70.59 per cwt. ((Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725))
ECAT	Brazilian imports of $13.707 billion in the first quarter of 1997 represented an increase of 27.65 percent over the same year-ago period while exports of $10.657 billion were only 3.61 percent higher, officials said. Mauricio Cortes, foreign trade secretary at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, said exports were boosted mainly by coffee and soybean sales. Coffee exports in the first quarter of 1997 were $621 million, an increase of 150.4 percent over the first three months of last year. Soybean sales were 11.61 percent higher at $500 million. On the imports side, all categories of goods showed increases. In a statement, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce said capital goods imports were $3.418 billion in first quarter 1997, a 41.3 percent rise year-on-year. Imports of primary and intermediate goods rose 16.5 percent to $6.277 billion while consumer goods imports rose 38.4 percent to $2.535 billion. Fuel and lubricant imports, identified by government officials as the trade balance bogeyman in the second half od 1996, were up 34 percent at $1.477 billion. The ministry and officials said that most capital goods imports were being used to increase Brazilian productivity. "In the absence of an increase in domestic supply, the rise in investment has no where to go except into exports," said Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros, economic policy secretary at the Finance Ministry.

CCAT	Shares in Mercury Asset Management Plc and other fund management groups were squeezed higher on Thursday on continued bid talk and in reflection of strong financial markets, dealers said. "The sector is in vogue," said one market maker, "bid stories are doing the rounds and they are not very liquid stocks." He said there was talk of a bid for MAM from HSBC Holdings Plc, up 20p at 15.91-1/2. "They are big enough and they have got the money," he said. MAM was up 31-1/2p at after reaching record 14.20 stg, passing the previous peak of 14.15 stg set on February 10. Volume reached 1.1 million shares. Other fund managers also rose with Perpetual Plc up 105p at 27.57-1/2 in volume of just 2,000 shares, M&G Group Plc up 30p at 14.32-1/2 stg and Henderson up 25p at 13.52-1/2. Close Brothers was up 10-1/2p at 420. Fund managers, whose earnings reflect strength in financial markets, also reflected gains in equities on both sides of the Atlantic.

MCAT	European bourses, nervous over the outlook for Wall Street, the world's biggest stock market, advanced in early trading on Wednesday after a rebound in New York and reassuring news on U.S. interest rates. On the foreign exchanges, the dollar slipped against the yen but rose versus the mark as Japanese trade figures and German money supply data moved it in different directions. Shares ended higher in New York on Tuesday, recovering from early losses after the Federal Reserve, as generally expected, kept interest rates unchanged. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 39.98 points at 6,308.33, erasing the previous day's losses. But U.S. bond prices fell on surprisingly strong November U.S. housing starts, which prompted some nervousness on interest rates further ahead. London share traders said trading was likely to be thin ahead of Christmas holidays. Investors continued to fret about the risk of a more pronounced drop on Wall Street, which still shows a 26 percent advance this year, even after recent weakness, they added. "We're in the silly season (pre-Christmas) now and most people are content to stay away until they adjust portfolios in the New Year," one London dealer said. Adding to question marks over Wall Street's prospects, top stategists at Merrill Lynch said investors might be better off with bonds instead of stocks next year. But the London stock market, Europe's busiest, took its cue from Wall Street's latest performance to open higher and was also boosted by news of an agreed 1.267 billion pound ($2.11 billion) bid by U.S. group Entergy for London Electricity. "Bid speculation has been going around the market over the last few days in various sectors. Today's bid will only add fuel to the fire," one trader said. French shares were aided by the Dow's gains and buoyed by prospects for lower interest rates. Wall Street's revival helped German shares make a firm start, too, as did a firmer dollar, good news for exporters. Weaker-than-expected German money supply data also helped. The Bundesbank said growth in its main monetary policy indicator, M3 money supply, slowed to an annualised rate of 8.0 percent in November from 8.4 percent in October. Economists had expected a more moderate slowdown but said it did not change their view that the central bank was unlikely to amend its policy just now. The currency market, however, lived in hope of lower German rates and boosted the dollar against the mark as a result. "The M3 data was just soft enough to keep interest in Thursday's meeting alive," said one trader at a British bank. The Bundesbank central council meets for the last time this year on Thursday and is set to announce its 1997 M3 growth targets at a news conference afterwards. Analysts said there was a faint chance the bank might shave its 3.0 percent securities repurchase rate. Market speculation on such a move grew after the Bank of France trimmed its key money rate to 3.15 percent from 3.20 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, French call money eased to 3-3/16 5/16 from 3-1/4 3/8, giving hope of more rate reductions, analysts said. The pound, meanwhile, rallied after strong British jobless and retail sales data. British November unemployment fell 95,800 to 1.93 million -- much more than a forecast 26,000 decline. This should increase the pressure for a rise in interest rates in Britain, dealers said. Sterling rose to $1.6737 and 2.5973 marks from 1.6713 and 2.5845 overnight. Currency trading was, however, thin ahead of the holiday season. "The Japanese trade data is the main story but the market is struggling to find an interest," said Adrian Schmidt at Chase Manhattan. The yen stengthened after news of an unexpected 0.2 percent year-on-year rise in Japan's custom-cleared trade surplus and a sharp 31.2 percent rise in its surplus with the United States. CURRENCIES AT 1030 GMT The dollar was quoted around 1.5518 marks and 113.53 yen, compared with 1.5454 and 113.73 in late business on Monday. STOCK MARKETS AT 1030 GMT The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 21.3 points at 4,000.9. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX was 8.96 higher at 2,824.09.

ECAT	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a meeting of state governors on Sunday that he saw no sign of big price pressures in the economy, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad said. Branstad, who was taking notes at the closed-door meeting, told reporters afterwards that Greenspan said he "saw no evidence of significant price pressure." Summing up Greenspan's comments to the governors on the economy, Branstad said, "He gave a positive report. We've had growth with low inflation."   Greenspan told the governors that technology is changing the economy very dramatically, Branstad said, boosting growth but making workers feel more insecure about their jobs. The Fed chief noted that unions have been emphasizing job security in recent negotiations with their employers. Asked about the accuracy of the consumer price index, Greenspan told the governors that progress has been made in improving the accuracy of the measure, Branstad said.
MCAT	NEW YORK, Nov 7 - The dollar tumbled against the yen Thursday to its lowest level in nearly a month, buffeted by comments from a senior Japanese offical and the head of a manufacturers group in the United States. The Nikkei Financial Daily newspaper quoted Eisuke Sakakibara as saying the dollar's correction from last year's sharp slide against the yen was about finished and that Japan's Ministry of Finance was not trying to weaken the yen further. When questioned by reporters later, Sakakibara, director-general of the International Finance Bureau, stood by his remarks. He also said the financial markets' view of the Japanese economy was too pessimistic and that the economy was stronger than the markets' assessment. This was echoed by the director-general of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Taro Aso, who conceded the economic recovery is still moderate but emphasised that conditions have improved from two or three months ago. "The Japanese government feels that the yen does not need to weaken any further and that the economy is a little stronger than it's been given credit for," said David Durrant, a senior currency strategist at I.D.E.A. Inc., a consulting firm. He predicted the dollar's decline against the yen is not finished. The Bank of Japan has kept official interest rates at rock-bottom levels to help stimulate economic growth in Japan, but rates may increase as the economy rebounds. Higher rates would help the Japanese currency by making yen-denominated deposits more attractive to foreign investors. The dollar began slipping in Tokyo and slid even further when trading got underway in Europe and New York. The U.S. currency fell in New York to 111.27 yen, its lowest level since reaching 110.85 yen on Oct. 11. It also weakened against other major currencies. In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 111.90 yen and 1.5112 German marks, down from 113.95 yen and 1.5175 marks on Wednesday. Remarks by Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, added to the dollar's woes. He predicted the White House will de-emphasise the value of a strong dollar as the U.S. economy slows. Such a change would contrast with the policy adopted by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who has repeatedly called for a strong dollar. A firm dollar can hurt foreign demand for American-made exports, but it may help by making U.S. stocks and bonds more attractive to foreign investors. Elliott Dix, an assistant vice president of foreign exchange at Signet Bank, doubted that Rubin would endorse a weak dollar policy. "I think he would recognise that the dollar strength is very important to the U.S. economy drawing investment from overseas," Dix said. In other trading, the dollar fell to 1.2734 Swiss francs late Thursday from 1.2775 francs on Wednesday. The British pound climbed to $1.6490 from $1.6415. The dollar slid to Canadian $1.3292 from C1.3318.
GCAT	The White House expressed confidence Friday that two embattled Cabinet nominees will be confirmed by the Senate once they are given a chance to answer questions about their past. Senate committees have delayed confirmation hearings on Alexis Herman, Clinton's choice to head the Labour Department, and Anthony Lake, his nominee to serve as director of the CIA, until additional background investigations are completed. Herman has been linked to an unfolding controversy over questionable use of the White House to court campaign contributors for the Democratic Party and Lake has been challenged for his role in secretly allowing Iran to ship arms to Bosnian Moslems, in violation of a U.N. embargo and official U.S. policy. "Senators have to pursue questions that they think are legitimate," White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said in downplaying the notion that the administration was concerned about the fate of the two nominees. "We're respecting the advise and consent role of the Senate," McCurry said of the confirmation process. "Senators have raised questions that they want answered and have the right to get those answers." "We're confident that ... in both cases they are meeting with senators and making very effective presentations and we're confident they will satisfy the concerns that are there and will ultimately be confirmed," McCurry said. Herman was to meet on Friday with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to discuss questions raised about her actions as director of the White House office of public liaison. Lott, a Mississippi Republican, has publicly said he believes Herman might have come close to violating the Hatch Act, which bars federal officials from partisan activities. During Clinton's re-election campaign, Herman was responsible for inviting the comptroller of the currency, Eugene Ludwig, to a White House social gathering attended by Democratic Party fundraisers, top banking officials and Clinton. Clinton admitted on Tuesday that Ludwig should not have been included in a gathering that mixed bankers and a federal regulator who exercises authority over them. The nomination of Lake, the president's former national security adviser, has generated stiff opposition because of his admitted failure to notify Congress that the administration was turning a blind eye to the flow of Iranian arms to Bosnian Moslems in 1994 despite a U.N. arms embargo. House Republicans have asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Lake, and other U.S. officials, lied to Congress about the policy. A spokesman said the request was being reviewed. The Justice Department's Public Integrity Section already is investigating Lake's failure to comply immediately with a ruling by the White House legal counsel that he needed to sell some energy stocks in order to avoid a potential conflict of interest. White House officials called the stocks matter a simple oversight. Lake also acknowledged that he made a mistake in not informing Congress of the Bosnian arms policy. Thus far, the Senate has confirmed four of Clinton's nominees with little dissent -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defence Secretary William Cohen, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Commerce Secretary William Daley.

CCAT	French computer group Cie des Machines Bull said it expected to post a net consolidated profit for 1996 and a significant improvement in 1997. It said in a statement that four key shareholders, NEC, Motorola, France Telecom and Dai Nippon Printing were increasing its share capital by 100 million francs each.   "The sale figure for December, which makes up about 20 percent of annual sales, remains a determining factor for the result. Nevertheless the group, despite the costs related to the repositioning of the personal computer activities in the first half (with a negative impact of 661 million francs on results) expects to realise in 1996 a positive net consolidated result for the second year running," Bull said. "For the year 1997, taking account of the non-recurrent character of the 1996 losses related to personal computers, Groupe Bull has as objective to obtain a net consolidated result significantly higher than 1996 as well as 1995."   It added that the 400 million francs in capital increase included both the 10 million new shares sold by the state as well as the exercise of options acquired at 22.04 francs per share in September 1995. The 22 franc share price of the latest share sale is twice the 1995 price which was based in the net asset per share value on December 1994 and is 1.4 times the expected net asset per share for December 31, 1996. An extraordinary general meeting will be held on February 19 and share trading, suspended since November 26, will resume soon. The stake of IBM slips to 0.7 from 0.8 pct.
ECAT	A last ditch measure proposed by the IMF to save Bulgaria's crumbling economy is not a panacea and is seen by some as a risky experiment which will not compensate for sluggish reform, analysts said on Friday. Senior IMF officials are talking to Bulgarian officials, politicians and bankers about introducing a currency board to stabilise the country's economy by curbing inflation and restoring confidence in the lev currency. Under the currency board system, the amount of national currency in circulation must be exactly matched by the central bank's hard currency reserves. Currency boards, pegging the local currency usually to the dollar, have been used by Argentina, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia to restore confidence and help defeat hyperinflation. "The most important element of overall stabilisation is that a currency board must be supported by reforms in the real economy, in the financial system and in legislation," economist Mariella Nenova said. A finance ministry official who declined to be named said, "It is illusionary to believe that the currency board alone would resolve all problems. Besides, adopting such a system, which would have to last for around three years at least, is a serious responsibility to future generations." He said none of the countries with currency board systems have had Bulgaria's huge domestic debt problem. Neither the IMF nor the cabinet has so far come up with solutions for the country's 600 billion levs ($2.4 billion) domestic debt. The rate at which the lev would be pegged had not been discussed yet, the central bank said. Dealers said it would be logical to peg the lev to the mark as Germany is Bulgaria's biggest investor and trade partner, but there is a strong perception of the dollar as a benchmark of stability and most people convert savings into dollars. The Deputy Director of the IMF European Department, Michael Deppler, said that delays to reforms by Bulgaria's six governments since 1989 have produced much bigger and deeper problems than the Fund or the government had expected. The IMF has said it would support a currency board plan, which would take up to three months to implement, but has not said by how much. Finance Minister Dimitar Kostov said the amount of levs in circulation, including commercial banks' minimum reserve deposits in the central bank totalling 169 billion levs, would have to be matched with foreign exchange reserves. BNB forex reserves stood at $541 million at the end of October and the country would also have to collateralise its gold, said Kostov. He did not say whether all of the country's gold would be collateralised or only some 4.5 tonnes kept in banks abroad. Bulgaria's strategic gold reserves held in the central bank total some 33 tonnes, or about 1.5 million troy ounces. Fixing the lev would also curb speculation on the local interbank forex market, which has existed since February 1991 when the lev became internally convertible, dealers said. Bulgaria's alternative is to continue its current high interest rate monetary restriction policy, but this would keep inflation high, Kostov said on Thursday. Bulgaia's monthly consumer price inflation was 16.7 percent in October. He said a currency board was the less risky of the two and a political consensus was needed on which option to choose. The IMF has twice postponed a $115 million loan due to Bulgaria's failure to meet reform targets which include curbing inflation, stabilising the exchange rate, speeding up privatisation and closing loss-making enterprises. Bulgaria has overshot all of its budget targets for this year and has postponed drafting the 1997 budget until the end of December due to unpredictability of the interest rate, currently 180 percent.

Traders said the market was still looking for heavy buying from major consumers and most houses were on a hand-to-mouth existence at the moment. "The level of action is really sporadic," one dealer said.

ECAT	Businesses and consumers round the globe have an immediate reason to cheer the results of the World Trade Organisation's inaugural ministerial conference. Prices for a huge array of goods should fall following an agreement to scrap tariffs on computer chips and other information technology (IT) products, a market worth $600 billion a year and growing at an explosive pace. But the weeklong meeting may also be remembered as the conference that sowed the seeds of an important new round of negotiations to free up global trade in the 21st century. "Round or no round, the process of liberalisation after the negotiations today will go on very expeditiously," an ebullient Renato Ruggiero, the director-general of the WTO, said on Friday as the conference closed. Ruggiero, 66, had reason to be pleased. The reputation of global summits had been on the slide. Recent international conferences on development, the family and food security among others had been criticised as little more than talking shops. So when ministers from 128 member states of a body that operates by consensus gathered to shape an agenda for the turn of the century, expectations were understandably modest. But by the end of the week Ruggiero was savouring a deal to remove tariffs on IT that should give a powerful boost to the fastest-growing sector of the world economy and build voters' support for free trade by making everyday goods cheaper. He also skilfully steered the meeting, after long nights of haggling, to compromises over the work the Geneva-based WTO will begin on links between trade, investment, competition and government procurement. With some governments hoping the preparatory studies will lead to global rules to protect foreign investors and halt anti-competitive practices that skew trade, the talks could lead eventually to a vast extension of the WTO's reach. From the outside, nitpicking over nuances in a ministerial statement might seem hard to comprehend. But if the arguments were fierce, especially over whether to delve into the link between trade and labour standards, it was because ministers knew the longer-term stakes were high. "History has shown that generalised words should not be dismissed as waffle but rather regarded as the first foundation and building block for agreements," European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan told reporters. A new cycle of talks over farm products and services is due to begin in 1999 in any case as part of the follow-up to the 1986-1993 Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. The talks on agriculture, which excites political, economic and cultural passions like no other sector, are sure to be arduous. Some governments will insist on parallel negotiations in other areas to increase the opportunties for horse trading, which is what happened in the drawn-out Uruguay Round. Ruggiero acknowledged that the prospect of another full-blown round so soon stirs uneasiness in many capitals. But he said the speed with which major trading countries were able to thrash out an IT deal showed this need not be an insuperable obstacle to further trade liberalisation. "Things are changing, and they are changing fast. Before, there was the idea that no sectoral agreement could be reached if there was not a Round. And yet now we have reached an important agreement on IT in just a few months," he said. His conclusion? "When we are trading into the future, we are very fast. It is only when we begin to talk about textiles and agriculture -- the traditional sectors -- that negotiations are very difficult."
ECAT	FRANKFORT, Ky., May 6 (Retuer) - Kentucky Budget Director Jim Ramsey has recommended the state issue $100 million general obligation bonds to finance 27 construction projects approved in last year's legislative session, the Herald-Leader reported Tuesday. The projects were originally to be funded from a cash surplus. Gov. Paul Patton has recommended that the surplus money be used instead to pay for education projects and to partly fund $214 million court-ordered intangibles tax refunds. Ramsey briefed the legislature's education committee Monday on issues they are likely to face in a special legislative session that begins next week. Ramsey also said that although long-range forecasts had projected a $13 million budget shortfall by fiscal 1999, state economists are now confident economic growth will eliminate the threat of a deficit. He noted that during the last four budget years, Kentucky's actual revenues have outpaced initial estimates by $48 million to $178 million a year. ((--Jane Sutton, 305-374-5013))
GCAT	Italy's Alberto Tomba tumbled out of the top 15 of the World Cup giant slalom rankings on Tuesday and the fall may have seriously hurt his chances of defending his world championship crown. Still battling the flu bug that forced him out of the second leg of the slalom in Chamonix last Sunday, Tomba chose not to race in Adelboden, the final giant slalom before next month's championships in Sestriere. His absence could prove costly. For the first time in a decade, the flamboyant Italian, winner of three Olympic golds including two in the giant slalom, finds himself outside the seeded first 15 skiers and will not have the luxury of drawing his start number at the championships. Hampered by injury and illness, Tomba has not completed a giant slalom this season. In his only race on January 5 in Kranjska Gora he failed to finish, skiing out in the second run. Tomba's inactivity has not only left him rusty but a lowly 21st in the rankings. Before they race for the giant slalom gold on February 12 however, Tomba could move up the rankings and possibly back into the top 15 depending on which skiers are nominated by their countries for the race. For the world championships each country is allowed only four skiers per event. Currently there are seven Austrians ahead of Tomba in the rankings, meaning he could be ranked no worse than 18th. Tomba may also choose not to defend his giant slalom title and concentrate on claiming a second slalom crown instead.

ECAT	Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen has said he would not rule out another reduction in Bundesbank interest rates in the present economic cycle but added that he did not see one. He told reporters at a dinner on Wednesday evening that acceleration in M3 money supply growth in May was not good but not dramatic either. "I see with a certain amount of concern that price pressures are emerging from abroad and in raw materials," Jochimsen said. But he added that price increases were not accelerating. "The increase in M3 growth is not nice but it's not dramatic," Jochimsen said. "I don't rule out a further interest rate cut but I don't see it." M3 money supply growth in May accelerated to 7.0 percent from 6.7 percent in April, surprising financial markets which had expected the Bundesbank's key policy indicator to enter its target growth zone for 1997 of 3.5 percent to 6.5 percent. Jochimsen is president of the state central bank of North Rhine-Westphalia.
ECAT	British broad money supply made a welcome return inside the government's monitoring range in July but it will give Chancellor Clarke only a shred of support if he is seeking to cut rates on September, analysts said. "This only helps Clarke only at the absolute margin," said Kevin Darlington, UK economist at ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett. "It is only one month's figures, it is still very high within the monitoring range and it has been downgraded as an indicator." The year-on-year growth rate of M4 eased to 8.8 percent in the July compared with 9.9 percent in June.   The government's monitoring range for broad money is three to nine percent and M4 growth has been above the nine percent upper limit since November 1995. Minutes of monthly monetary meetings show the both Clarke and Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George are concerned that M4 is so strong but Darlington said since base rates have been cut four times in that period, broad money has clearly been relegated to the second division of indicators. Its credibility as a leading indicator of future inflation has been slightly hampered by upward distortions over the last year due to several special factors.   These include the rash of merger activity in the financial sector and the start of an open gilt repo market in January. The large drop in year-on-year M4 growth in July is partly attributable to last July's purchase of the Cheltenham & Gloucester building society by the Lloyds TSB group. A surplus on the government's PSBR account during July also helped depress the level. But economists said the breakdown clearly shows activity in consumer sector is growing. "Headline M4 may be below market expectations, but the composition is not as favourable," said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America.   An incomplete breakdown of the lending figures produced by the British Bankers' Association shows consumer credit was up 539 million stg, nearly double the June figure of 226 million stg rise. "This suggests that there may be some upside to July's retail sales figures. If so then the chances of another rate cut look remote," Hawkins said. July retail sales data are due on Wednesday and forecast to show only a small 0.1 percent rise. But Darlington said he would not be surprised if Clarke squeezed in another cut in the autumn on the back of improving inflation statistics.   "It is very finely poised. I wouldn't be surprised if we get another cut based on falling underlying cost pressures and slow pay growth," Darlington said. Marian Bell, Treasury economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, went further and said the M4 data have clearly enhanced the chances of a rate cut next month. "This will greatly strengthen the Chancellor's hand in discussions with the Bank. As such it must significantly increase the potential for a rate cut in September." The next monetary meeting is on September 4. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7715
ECAT	Sri Lanka's foreign exchange reserves at the end of January were a provisional $2.403 billion, down 5.3 percent over the same period a year ago, the Central Bank said in a report on Monday. It said foreign exchange reserves at end-January last year were $2.538 billion. Central Bank officials said the reserves were sufficient to cover five months' imports.
ECAT	New Zealand Treasurer Winston Peters said in notes for a speech to parliament on Thursday that he expected the net impact of one-off fiscal items would be to reduce the level of budget surplus expected for 1997/98. Although he did not specify the degree of impact, Peters said he could reassure parliament that the government would still be expecting a surplus "and a surplus large enough to continue to provide a buffer if the economy or other events prove to be less favourable than we are currently predicting".   "The main drivers of this change in forecasts are cyclical. They do not represent a change in the government's policies, nor do they represent much ongoing impact on the government's fiscal position. "But this does mean some of the questions that some commentators have recently been asking about the government's policy response to the surplus are wide of the mark," Peters added.   Peters gave two examples of "one-off and technical matters" that would impact on the operating surplus, noting the overall effect of a series of them would be to reduce the surplus. "We had previously included provision for a settlement with Ngai Tahu in the 1996/97 fiscal year. It's now clear that this settlement will occur in the 1997/98 year," the notes said. Under an agreement in principle struck last October, the government is to make a NZ$170 million settlement in land and cash to the South Island Maori tribe.   He also cited technical changes to superannuation forecasting which added to next year's expenditure, but gave no financial details.

MCAT	Belgian linear bonds (OLOs) ended flat to slightly lower on Monday as markets around Europe went into a holding pattern ahead of the release of key U.S. economic data later in the week. The yield on the benchmark 10-year OLOs maturing May 2006 ended at 6.63 percent, up 0.01 from Friday, with the premium over 10-year Bunds at 24 from 23. "Buyers are definitely waiting for better levels and the odds are in their favour," one trader commented. Any data confirming the U.S. economy was hotting up will send yields soaring and bond prices falling, he said.   U.S. markets were closed on Monday for Labour Day, as were banks in neighbouring Luxembourg, contributing to a quiet day in Belgium's bond market. Dealers expected little action before Tuesday's release of the U.S. July leading indicator and National Association of Purchasing Managers Index for August and, further ahead, the key U.S. August employment report on Friday. "I expect the really big moves will come on Friday," one dealer said. "Everyone closed down their positions last week and the market is now just waiting." -- Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6810, Fax +32 2 230 7710

MCAT	Primary market activity focused on the dollar-bloc on Thursday as several retail-targeted issues were launched against the backdrop of firm U.S. assets. Leading the way was the Inter-American Development Bank which partly rolled over a maturing $700 million bond with a $200 million three-year Eurobond reoffered at a yield flat to U.S. Treasuries via SBC Warburg. "We expect to see some redemption flow go into this issue particularly as they are the same (6.00 percent) coupon," a syndicate manager at the lead said, adding the launch had gone ahead with several orders already on the book. SBC Warburg said it had seen good demand in the World Bank issue launched July 24 by Commerzbank which has tightened to two b.p. through U.S. Treasuries from its flat reoffer spread. "We felt that IADB at 2 b.p. cheaper would offer some value. Retail tend to stick to the shorter maturities in this curve environment, where everything is fairly flat and volatile-especially ahead of the numbers coming out next week." Demand for today's deal came from Swiss and German investors, with some institutional demand from the Middle East. During the afternoon session paper was bid flat to U.S. Treasuries on broker screens. Elsewhere, Merrill Lynch, which has had more than a modicum of success recently with several self-led deals, scored again with a $300 million four-year deal at a 41 b.p. spread over the three-year U.S. Treasury note. Dealers said the issue quickly tightened through the 40 b.p. level. Merrill Lynch is rated Aa3/AA-. Yamalo-Nenets joined a long queue of Russian regions and cities planning Eurobond issues. The autonomous region, located in Russia's Far North, announced plans for a $100-150 million Eurobond later this year, with the lead manager due to be picked later this month. Yamalo-Nenets contains most of Russia's gas reserves and is a rarity in not getting financial help from the federal budget. It is also planning a domestic bond worth 1.5 trillion roubles ($260 billion) in by September. -- Dan Lalor, London newsroom +44 171 542 8863
GCAT	A Yemeni threw a hand-grenade at a group of soldiers and killed two of them, an official said on Tuesday. "What happened unfortunately is that a citizen threw a hand-grenade at a security unit. There were two martyrs," Saeed al-Hekaimi, spokesman for the Supreme Election Committee, told reporters. "Investigations are underway on the matter. This is not an election dispute or an election crime. It's a criminal act." Hekaimi said the incident in the city of Taiz, 260 km (160 miles) south of the capital Sanaa, took place on Monday. Yemenis voted in parliamentary elections on Sunday. The elections and pre-election period have been marred by several violent attacks which have claimed more than 10 lives. Before voting began, a soldier on Sunday started shooting at people randomly at a polling station in the southern town of Mukayras, killing five soldiers and three civilians. A Western election observer had said a security official was shot dead in a separate incident on Sunday in the town of Dhamar, about 100 km (60 miles) south of Sanaa.
GCAT	Hicham el Guerrouj, who shattered two world indoor records in the space of 10 days last month, could earn himself $100,000 for roughly three and half minutes on the boards this weekend. The 22-year-old Moroccan has rescinded an earlier decision to miss the sixth world indoor championships starting at the Bercy stadium on Friday, tempted possibly by the small fortune available at the three-day competition. For the first time at a world championships, prize money up to $50,000 will be paid to gold medallists plus a bonus of $50,000 for any athlete breaking a world record. El Guerrouj fell in the Olympic 1,500 metres final last year but showed his class later in the season by clocking the second fastest 1,500 ever at the Brussels grand prix. Africans have been to the fore in this year's indoor season, a compressed version of the sport designed primarily for European and north Americans athletes forced indoors by cold northern winters. Haile Gebrselassie, the Olympic 10,000 metres champion, has been in extraordinary form this year, breaking the world 5,000 metres record as well as racing over a variety of distances from 800 to 3,000 metres. The Ethiopian will take on Kenya's world steeplechase champion Moses Kiptanui in a race which may go to the shrewdest rather than the speediest runner. "It's going to be a hard race between Gebrselassie and me," Kiptanui said after winning the 3,000 metres at the Birmingham grand prix 11 days ago. "It's going to be a very tactical race but if we're running too slow, we have a lot of speedsters behind us. If we're going too slow then we might even lose it." Olympic high hurdles champion Allen Johnson, who announced his presence on the international stage by taking the world indoor title in Barcelona two years ago, injured his left knee at the U.S. championships last Saturday and did not compete in the final. Johnson said the injury was not serious and if he has no lingering after effects his clash with former outdoor world champion Colin Jackson should be one of the highlights of the competition. Johnson has announced his intention to break the Briton's outdoor world mark this year, adding: "I want my opponents to realise when they're running against me they're fighting for second place." Jackson may also leave his mark as a coach at these championships, with his protg Jamie Baulch rated as one of the favourites for the 400 metres. "As (double Olympic champion) Michael Johnson is not running, you never know what could happen," said Baulch. The women's events will be graced by two veterans of the circuit in 38-year-old Mary Slaney and Jamaican roving ambassador Merlene Ottey, Slaney's junior by two years. Slaney, who won gold over 1,500 and 3,000 at the inaugural world outdoor championships 14 years ago, has lost count of the number of leg operations she has been forced to endure over the years. But although officially a veteran she ran the fastest time for 12 years over 1,500 metres at the U.S. championships and believes she could be the first woman to run faster than four minutes indoors. The women's pole vault will be staged for the first time at a world championships with Australia's former circus acrobat Emma George the clear favourite. George has come a long way since she exhibited her tumbling abilities for a childhood troupe known as "The Flying Fruit Flies" and already this year she has twice improved the world outdoor mark. "The really important thing is to win," she said. "If the record came as well that's fine but I think it's most important for me to win a major title."
ECAT	Zambia said on Wednesday a rise in the price of maize would cause the southern African country to miss its annual inflation target. "Our target for the year was 18 percent but because of the maize distortion we hope to achieve a year-end inflation of 26 percent," Zambian Finance Minister Ronald Penza told Reuters. Penza, speaking at the Southern African Trade and Investment Summit in Harare, said the target was still a substantial drop on the 45 percent inflation seen last year. -- Paul Harris, Harare Newsroom + 263-4 72 52 27/8/9
MCAT	Spanish government bonds ended higher, but off intraday highs after weakness in U.S. Treasuries this afternoon. "The Spanish market's stopped advancing because of the downturn in Treasuries, but the market's base is positive" said one trader. Comments by US Fed Governor Janet Yellen that the US economy had entered an inflationary danger zone had an impact, he said. Bonos were boosted by gains in the peseta against the mark amid expectations of benign domestic inflation and possible near-term rate cuts, dealers said. "The domestic outlook is favourable and the perception of the budget is positive," said one. -- Madrid newsroom +341 585 2160
GCAT	Two loud explosions rocked two central Havana hotels within minutes of each other on Saturday and one witness said it appeared at least three people were hurt. There was no indication as to what caused the explosions at the Hotel Nacional and the nearby Hotel Capri. A Danish tourist who was sitting in the Hotel Nacional garden at the time of the explosion said he saw at least three people on the ground afterward, apparently injured.   The tourist, Ole Madsen, told Reuters that some of those on the ground at the Nacional were bleeding. He did not know if the injured were Cubans or foreign tourists. At least four ambulances left the hotel about 20 minutes after the explosion, although it was not clear if they carried wounded people. Witnesses said the explosions took place at about 11:25 a.m. (1525 GMT) and 11:30 a.m. (1530 GMT). A security cordon of uniformed police and plainclothes security officials prevented reporters entering the Nacional. But Madsen said the explosion there appeared to have ripped through a row of telephone booths in the lobby. He said ground floor windows opening on the hotel's back garden were broken. About 200 yards (metres) up the street at the Hotel Capri, at least three ground floor front windows were shattered by the explosion there. The explosion also appeared to have hit the lobby, although police prevented reporters from entering.
MCAT	Blue-chip stocks shook off a bad bear day to close higher Tuesday following a recovery in bonds and more strong gains in technology stocks. The Nasdaq composite index racked up its ninth consecutive record close. Based on early and unofficial data, the Dow ended up 52.73 points at 7,975.71. The Nasdaq index rose 18.25 points to a new high of 1,542.13. In the broader market, advancing issues led declines by a small margin on heavy volume of 600 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
CCAT	Blessings Corp said on Wednesday its fourth quarter net earnings after tax would be essentially break-even, compared to net income after tax of $0.17 per share in the same period last year. Raw material costs were not expected to decline until 1997 and margins were projected to remain near historic lows through the quarter, Elwood Miller, president and chief executive officer, said.
MCAT	After a year stuck in the doldrums since its postwar reopening, the Beirut Stock Exchange is starting to show signs of increased activity as Lebanese interest rates drop and new bank shares liven up the market. Beirut stockbrokers say local and Arab investors are beginnning to show interest in shares as yields plunge on government treasury bills, which have soaked up private investment for the past four years, and newly-listed Beirut bank stocks offer healthy returns. Volume has just about doubled to nearly $2 million on a busy day on the Beirut bourse since the first two banks listed in December and January -- enough for traders to proclaim the first signs of a turnround on the market. "I think the process of investor interest in the stock exchange has begun. It's inevitable," said Alain Balian, a deputy manager at Lebanon Invest finance house. "Obviously falling interest rates cool interest in t-bills and among educated investors the banking sector is very attractive. "Banks have been making good money and everyone wants to get in on the game," Balian told Reuters. Yields on Lebanese three-month to two-year t-bills have dropped since November to a range of 13.87-16.18 percent from 14.56-21.58 percent and are still falling. Banks are also reducing interest rates sharply. Heavy demand for the two listed bank shares has encouraged Beirut stockbrokers. "It's only a small beginning, but it's good because it is a beginning," said Nabil Aoun, head of Fidus brokerage house, and a member of the stock exchange committee. Before the bank listings the only regular trade on the bourse was in Solidere, the real estate company rebuilding central Beirut, whose shares have performed disappointingly since a dramatic debut in 1994. Shares of the first bank to list, Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce, have risen 12 percent since their December 30 debut although the bank is not among Lebanon's top 10. BLC's performance has been outclassed by Banque Audi, a leading Beirut bank, whose shares have risen 15 percent in a month since their January 20 debut. Aoun said Fidus was taking more than $1 million in daily orders for Audi from Lebanese and Arab investors. Two more banks plan to list soon -- Bank of Beirut, which ranked 16th in 1996 in size of deposits among Lebanon's 82 banks, and Byblos Bank, one of the most dynamic in the country. Byblos this week reported a 60 percent 1996 rise in profits and brokers say its shares are shooting up in pre-listing trade on the grey market, nearing $6 from $2.60 two years ago. "Byblos will be a star on the stock exchange. It has a good record, clever management strategy and record profits for the past three or four years," said a banker. Listings by hotel and insurance companies are expected soon to diversify the market further. Alain Balian at Lebanon Invest said Societe des Grands Hotels du Liban, which is rebuilding Beirut's 572-room Phoenicia Intercontinental and has already reopened the 90-room Vendome Intercontinental, is making preparations to list its shares. Market sources say two insurance companies are also preparing to list, one of them possibly this year. So far, however, the Beirut stock market is extremely small. Capitalisation is $2.4 billion and investors have only seven shares to choose from -- two banks, four cement or industrial companies, and Solidere, which itself accounts for about $2.1 billion of the capitalisation. The cement and industrial companies are rarely traded on the exchange. Brokers cite their lack of transparency but say there is a lot more trading in their stocks on the grey market. Solidere's lacklustre performance, despite good 1996 results and progress in operations, puzzles some Beirut stockbrokers, particularly as Merrill Lynch reported in January the stocks were trading at a 43 percent discount to Net Asset Value. "The fundamentals are not driving the price....Fundamentally I think it's a good stock to buy, yet the price is not moving. It doesn't make sense," Balian said.
GCAT	U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's last regular day on the job will be Friday, the Energy Department said. President Clinton named Transportation Secretary Federico Pena to replace O'Leary, who had said she planned to leave after four years. The Senate Energy Committee has tentatively set a confirmation hearing for Pena for late this month.
MCAT	Hopes that Nawaz Sharif will win Pakistan's election may boost stocks temporarily, but renewed economic uncertainty after the February 3 polls could make any rally short-lived, analysts said on Sunday. The Karachi 100-share index gained 111.41 points to 1,452.72 points in seven sucessive sessions on expectations that Sharif, an industrialist seen as pro-business, would return to power. But the index fell back 21.27 points on Sunday a day after a bomb blast killed 26 people, including the leader of a militant Sunni Moslem faction, in the Punjab provincial capital Lahore. Most analysts said this could be a temporary setback unless the incident sparked widespread sectarian violence between Sunni and Shi'ite Moslem hardliners. "The market has built up on expectations of Nawaz Sharif becoming the next prime minister," Jahanzeb Naseer, research head at Jardine Fleming Broking Pakistan, told Reuters. President Farooq Leghari called the elections after sacking Benazir Bhutto's three-year-old government on November 5 on disputed charges of corruption and misrule. Naseer said most investors had beefed up their portfolios to pre-empt an expected post-election rally, adding that the market could rise another 100 points before polling day. Kalim Aziz, research head at ING Baring Securities, said that assuming the Lahore blast did not have major repercussions, the market can rise 50 points before the elections and another 100 points if Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League emerged as winner. "Sharif is perceived to be business-friendly," he said. Given current fundamentals and the more optimistic mood, the index should reach 1,550 points before polling day and a post-election rally could take it to 2,000, he said. "Based on market fundamentals at the moment, any fall below the 1,500-point mark will be illogical and any rise above 2,000 will be sentimental," Aziz added. Naseer said concerns about the health of the economy would dominate the post-election scenario. "Any post-election rally is likely to slow down within a month as the euphoria wears off and the economy will again be in focus," he said. He said the economy had shown little improvement over the past few months and was unlikely to perform well with an average of $1.25 billion due in quarterly foreign debt repayments. "The rupee will remain under pressure as the forex reserves level remains unsatisfactory, while inflation seems to be on the rise," he said. Aziz said the economy would remain worrisome until Pakistan returned to a lending programme under the International Monetary Fund's enhanced structural adjustment facility. Pakistan's caretaker government persuaded the IMF to resume a stalled standby loan in December, but the fund has yet to disburse an $80 million tranche due in mid-January. Anisur Rehman, research head at Crosby Securities, said jitters about the economy might keep the index below 1,600. Any rise above this level should be considered as a chance to exit.
MCAT	Tokyo stocks closed higher on Wednesday, as shares of major multinational companies continued to attract investors, supported by the yen's retreat against the dollar. But the market's upside was capped by strong selling demand, brokers said. The key Nikkei 225 average rose 228.79 points, or 1.26 percent, to end at 18,409.96. It had briefly climbed as high as 18,520.76. Its March futures were 190 points higher at 18,390. "The yen eased sufficiently and this will benefit (blue-chip) firms' earnings," said Kazuo Shiogai, deputy branch manager at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.

CCAT	- Melker Schorling, the chief executive of Swedish construction company Skanska, will take over as chairman of the group, daily Svenska Dagbladet reported on Monday. Schorling will replace Percy Barnevik who will step down to take control of Investor, the powerful Wallenberg family's key investment vehicle, sources told the newspaper. The decision was preceded by talks between the three groups controlling Skanska -- investment companies Custos and Industrivarden and banking group Handelsbanken, Svenska Dagbladet said. "Percy Barnevik showed his virtually unlimited influence on the Swedish business community when he ensured that Skanska's chief executive Melker Schorling will replace Barnevik as chairman of the construction group," the newspaper said. The power struggle has spilled over to Custos and it looks as if the company's chairman Marcus Storch, the former chief executive of medical and technical gas group AGA, will have to step down after losing the Skanska fight, the daily added. -- Birgitta Forsberg, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1017

Ten out of 15 economists polled by Reuters on Tuesday expected unchanged rates. Five forecast a five basis point cut. The Bank continued to post its five-to-10 day rate at 4.60 percent. The intervention rate, at which the central bank allocates repo funds, was last cut -- from 3.15 percent -- on January 30, 1997.

GCAT	A Palestinian military commander said on Friday the bombings near Tel Aviv's central bus station which injured 13 people were a response for last week's attack on Arabs in the West Bank town of Hebron. Brigadier Abu Ahmed Fu'ad, chief of the military department of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), refused to confirm or deny his group's responsibility for Thursday's two bomb blasts. "The Palestinian people are replying to the crime committed by Israel against the innocent people in Hebron. The bombings reflected our people's determination to continue resistance," Fu'ad told Reuters. The blasts came one week after an off-duty Israeli soldier shot into a crowd of Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron, wounding seven Arabs in what he said was an attempt to stop Israel from carrying out its long-overdue troop redeployment from the town. "We neither deny nor confirm our responsibility for the Tel Aviv blasts," Fu'ad said. Israeli police said they did not know who dropped the bombs in garbage cans in Tel Aviv on Thursday night. They said forensic evidence pointed to a terrorist act but they could not rule out a criminal gangland attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed "terrorists" and vowed to respond with "extreme severity" if the crude devices proved to have been planted by Arabs from areas under the control of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. The Damascus-based PFLP, led by George Habash, has wide support in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It belongs to a 10-member radical Palestinian alliance which vowed to destroy the 1993 peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. It claimed responsibility for the killing in December of a Jewish settler and her son in the West Bank.
GCAT	Edmonton Oilers centre Doug Weight, an emerging star who excelled for the victorious USA team in the recent World Cup, ended his holdout Tuesday, agreeing to a two-year contract with the club. Financial terms were not disclosed, but the Canadian Press news agency reported that the deal was worth $2.3 million per season. Weight, who missed all of pre-season, joined the team Tuesday night in Calgary and will practice with the club Wednesday in preparation for Friday's season opener. "There was never any question that I wanted him to play here and that Doug Weight wanted to be an Edmonton Oiler," Oilers President and General Manager Glen Sather said after ending tough negotiations with Weight's agent Steve Bartlett. "He's becoming a superstar in Edmonton ... the kind of player we can build our future around. I feel he's reached the level of one of the best in this league," added Sather, who said he expects Weight to lead the team into the playoffs this season. The Oilers have missed post-season for the last four years. The 25-year-old Weight enjoyed his best season in 1995-96, leading the Oilers with career highs of 25 goals and 79 assists. His 104 points put him 11th in league in overall scoring and he was tied for fifth in assists with Wayne Gretzky. Weight has led Edmonton in scoring the last three seasons, amassing 56 goals and 162 assists.
ECAT	Russia's government hopes industrial output will rise in 1997 for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union as investment is channelled from capital markets into industry, senior officials said on Friday. The government will push down government securities yields further, while modernising companies become more attractive by switching to international accounting standards, First Deputy Economy Minister Ivan Materov told a news conference. "We shall use a carrot and stick policy," he said. Materov said the government planned to push down yields on GKO discount Treasury bills by bringing more foreign investors into the market. He said Russia's first Eurobond, launched last week, and paying annual interest of 9.25 percent, would compete strongly with domestic paper. "It was a blow for domestic market yields," Materov said. T-bills yields have fallen to about 38 percent annually from about 200 percent in the summer. Funds which could be invested in industry total about 450 trillion roubles with about 300 trillion of this coming from households, Materov said. This amounts to 24 percent of gross domestic product, which is about the same as in Japan and South Korea, he said. "For Russia it is serious money," he said. He said that profitability of investment in industry would grow as companies modernise, adding that equipment imports accounted for most of Russia's total imports. Another First Deputy Economy Minister, Yakov Urinson, said investment in industry could offer a 40 percent return, but the investment process was hampered by high risks. These include poor protection of property and shareholders' rights and the widespread non-payment crisis, which is preventing many companies from paying off credits. "The government has prepared several documents and some of them are already in the (State) Duma (lower house) which will make it possible to provide all property rights guarantees," Urinson said. Officially, industrial production has halved since Russia launched its economic reform programme in 1992. Official data show October output was four percent lower than a year earlier. But Urinson said that the official statistics did not show the real picture as a big part of industrial production was hidden from taxes. He said the shadow economy accounted for about 25 percent of output after between 18 and 20 percent in 1995. "According to the Economy Ministry estimations, there is no fall in GDP at all," Urinson said. --Julie Tolkacheva, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
ECAT	A spokesman for the Office of Budget and Mangement (OMB), the White House bureau that drafts the president's budget, said on Thursday it received the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) economic assumptions. "We received the CBO economic assumptions late this afternoon and we are obviously looking at them with interest," the spokesman said. "They are important, in the sense that the more we know, and the sooner we know it, the more we will understand the difference in the OMB and CBO starting points."   "But we don't have the technical assumptions yet and we don't have the deficit baseline," he added. "We welcome the economic assumptions but they are only part of the story." The spokesman said that OMB expected to receive the CBO technical assumptions within the next few weeks, and said that if it did not receive them by Christmas it was unlikely to be able to integrate them into the president's fiscal year 1998 budget submission, expected to be published on Feb 3. "If we do not receive by Christmas, we are unlikely to be able to incorporate them in any way," he said. The CBO's economic assumptions lay out forecasts on the economy's growth, inflation and unemployment. The techincal assumptions contain more detailed forecasts that are equally critical for budget planners, including the expected government revenues and projected rates of growth in key goverment programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
CCAT	Unison HealthCare Corp on Monday said it expects to report a loss for the third quarter due to costs associated with the disposition of seven underperforming nursing homes. In a statement, the company said it expects to record a one-time, after-tax charge of approximately $2.4 million, or $0.57 per share, in the third quarter ended September 30, 1996. Including the nonrecurring charge, the company said it expects to report a loss in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 a share for the quarter.   Earnings per share before the one-time charge are expected to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.31 per share, including $0.02 per share of operating losses relating to these seven nursing homes. Final results for the third quarter will be reported on or about November 7. The company said the charge is a result of costs related to the anticipated disposition of seven underperforming nursing homes in Texas, Indiana and Kansas and the write-off of certain receivables which are not expected to be collected.
GCAT	The United Nations and Bosnian Serb police will start joint patrols in a village where a Serb mob attacked Moslems preparing housing for resettlement in Serb territory, Western officials said on Tuesday. At least three Moslems were injured on Sunday by a mob as they tried to begin building teporary homes in the war-battered village of Gajevi, on the Serb side of the ethnic boundary line between Bosnia's Serb and Moslem-Croat territories. Carl Bildt, the international high representative to Bosnia, deplored the incident and held an urgent meeting with Biljana Plavsic, president of the Bosnian Serb republic (RS) which, under the 1995 Dayton peace treaty, covers half of Bosnia but is not a separate state. "The RS condemned any form of violence and its Interior Minister was instructed to conduct an investigation of Sunday's incident," Bildt's spokesman Colum Murphy told a news conference on Wednesday. He said Serb officials and U.N. police monitors agreed that existing plans and procedures would be properly implemented in the future. "Joint patrols of the area will ensure this is implemented," he added. Law enforcement and human rights problems in postwar Bosnia are monitored by the International Police Task Force (IPTF). Under the Dayton peace accord refugees from all three sides are allowed to return to their homes but the process, fraught with lingering ethnic mistrust, has barely begun. "The IPTF expects to start joint patrols with RS police in Gajevi area immediately," said IPTF spokesman Alexander Ivanko. An IPTF patrol visited the village in northeastern Bosnia on its own on Monday and reported some of the Moslem construction workers had returned and resumed work, he said. "They didn't see any Serb civilians or police in the area," Ivanko said. Kris Janowski of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Moslems, driven out of Gajevi during war in 1992, would probably wait to see if Serb authorities would keep their promises on patrolling the area and ensuring safety. "But I am quite sure they are determined to go back there," he told reporters.

ECAT	Spanish Economy Secretary Cristobal Montoro said on Thursday that inflation is likely to end 1996 below the government's 3.4-percent target. "The fall (in the CPI) in October helps to confirm the achievement of the government's target. It's almost certain now that the CPI will end December below 3.4 percent, confirming the credibility of the 1997 target," Montoro told journalists while in parliament. The government's inflation target for 1997 is 2.6 percent.

CCAT	U.S. Facilities Corp said Tuesday it was on track for increased revenues and earnings for the full year 1996 if present business trends continue. U.S. Facilities earned $2.42 a share on revenues of $151.2 million in 1995. The company today reported third quarter earnings of $0.62 a share, up from $0.60 a year earlier. The company said it expects to take no extraordinary charges for losses due to natural disasters such as Hurricane Fran and other storms during the third quarter.
CCAT	Shares in British alarm and emergency communication systems firm Tunstall Group were marked down on Thursday after weaker-than-expected full year results were released. At 1150 GMT the share price was quoted at 261p -- down 32-1/2p -- but no stock had been traded. Tunstall's preliminary results statement for the year to September 30 showed pre-tax profits static at 8.2 million stg while turnover increased to 78.0 million stg from 60.7 million. The figures disappointed analysts who had forecast pre-tax profits of 8.4 million stg on average.   Tunstall chairman Michael Dawson blamed lacklustre performance on anticipated orders not materialising and a lapse in control of overheads and margins which, he said, had now been rectified. --Catherine Bremer, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
ECAT	The Cahners Business Confidence Index (CBCI) fell 0.9 point to 66.6 in June versus May, Cahners Economics said. "The June CBCI revealed that manufacturers are feeling slightly less sanguine about the American economy than they did in May," a Cahners report said. Five of the seven CBCI components fell in June. The sharpest decline came from plans to increase marketing spending, which dropped 2.6 points to 64.5 in June. The employment component, which had recorded the sharpest gain during May, slipped 1.7 points to 68.9, the report showed. The product introductions measure posted the greatest gain, up 1.9 points to 72.7, while research and development rose a meagre 0.1 point to 64.0. "The June CBCI indicates that businesses are beginning to prepare for slower growth in consumer spending and business investment in the months ahead, following the exceptional 5.8-percent gain in first-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP)," noted Cahners economist Daryl Delano. "This should please the (Federal Reserve) and keep inflation -- and interest rates -- at bay," he said. (( -- N.A. Treasury Desk, 212-859-1660 ))
ECAT	Algeria on Wednesday forecast a current account surplus of $300 million by the end of 1966, reversing a forecast of a $2 billion deficit, an official statement said. The statement, carried by the official news agency APS after a cabinet meeting, said total imports in the first half of the year fell by 15 percent, giving a surplus trade balance of $1.3 billion. No figures were given for total exports for the period from the North African country which earns 94 percent of foreign income from oil and gas sales abroad. In June this year, official figures showed total exports, mainly of oil and gas, reached $10.240 billion for the whole of 1995 compared with $8.501 billion for all of 1994. Imports in 1995, according to the earlier figures, were put at $10.761 billion, against $9.365 billion in 1994. Wednesday's statement said non-energy exports rose by 53.4 percent to $366 million in the first six months of 1996. It said imports fell because of a good harvest, recession and stagnation in the industrial sector, and a drop in the purchasing power of Algeria's 29 million people. "The drop of costly food imports alone attained 29 percent compared with the previous year," the statement said. Non-energy industrial production fell by 7.4 percent in the first six months of 1996, compared with the whole of the previous year for which no figure was given. "The hydrocarbon sector in the first half of 1996  saw a growth rate of eight percent compared with the first half of the previous year, notably because of an increase of gas production -- up 8.1 percent -- growth of condensate production up 6.6 percent, growth of refined products up 3.7 percent, and the reinforcement of gas liquefaction, up 15.1 percent.
GCAT	Former Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez on Friday urged Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic to seize the chance to install "real democracy" in the country and end the current unrest. Gonzalez, back from a mission to Belgrade for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), was speaking at a news conference after issuing a report saying the Serbian opposition won elections annulled by Milosevic.   "There exists an extraordinary opportunity for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to solve this concrete problem, to initiate real democracy in the country, and to reintegrate itself into the international community," Gonzalez said. This chance, he added, "must be seized by the authorities, by the opposition and the citizens of Yugoslavia." Outgoing OSCE chairman and Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti told the news conference he had telephoned Milosevic to tell him of the Gonzalez mission's findings -- which included an implicit appeal for opposition election victories to be reinstated. Cotti said he expected the Serbian leader to make his response known early next week. Danish Foreign Minister Niels Petersen, who takes over the OSCE presidency on January 1, said the body would hold a full Council meeting at the end of next week in Vienna to consider Milosevic's reply.
GCAT	Alger Hiss, accused of being a spy for the Soviet Union at a time when the United States was gripped by fears of Communist infiltration, died on Friday at the age of 92. Hiss died at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City after a long illness, a hospital spokeswoman said.   Journalist Whittaker Chambers accused Hiss in 1948 of having given him U.S. government secrets to pass to the Soviets. Hiss sued Chambers for libel and Chambers produced classified documents, some of which he said were written in Hiss's handwriting and others typed on the Hiss family typewriter. Then Congressman Richard Nixon, who would later become president, led the prosecution case against Hiss. Hiss was tried for perjury. His first trial ended in a hung jury, but a second trial in 1950 ended in a guilty verdict. Sentenced to five years in prison, he served 44 months. While the question of his guilt or innocence was never fully resolved, a senior adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin said in 1992 that newly opened files showed no evidence that Hiss had spied for Moscow.
CCAT	The president of the executive and professional employees association of state National Bank was quoted as saying in a statement that the bank will raise its share capital by 50 billion drachmas by year-end 1997. Constantine Liakopoulos, the president of the executive and professional employees association, was speaking at a bank event on Saturday. The bank will also issue bonds worth between $150 to $200 million to be placed with foreign investors and restructure its portfolio and real estate holdings, he said. The restructuring will seek to improve returns, while the revaluation of fixed assets will boost the bank's equity by 14.2 billion drachmas. The bank will proceed with the issuance of a Visa card, Liakopoulos was quoted as saying. National Bank is expanding in the Balkans with the establishment of its National Insurance new branch in Bucharest, Romania, he added. --Margarita Sotiropoulou, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
ECAT	Weak growth in Japan's money supply in June was largely due to sluggish demand for bank loans, economists said on Thursday. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) said earlier that Japan's broadly defined money supply average of M2 plus certificates of deposit (CDs) grew a preliminary 2.8 percent in June from a year earlier. M2 plus CD growth for May was revised up to 3.1 percent from a preliminary 3.0 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the June figure to rise by 2.8 percent to 3.1 percent year-on-year. Most had forecast a rise of either 2.9 percent or 3.0 percent. The lower-than-expected growth in June was also due to technical reasons, said Mamoru Yamaguchi, an economist at Nikko Research Center. "The month-end coincided with a weekend in June 1996, while the last day of June this year was a Monday. So the slower year-on-year growth may have been due to this technical factor," Yamaguchi said. Weak demand for bank loans among big corporations and a cautious lending stance by banks towards non-manufacturers and small companies were behind the continuation of the slow growth in money supply, said Youchi Itoh, a senior economist at Daiwa Institute of Research. "Banks, still suffering from bad loan problems, are unwilling to lend to smaller companies. They are willing to lend to bigger companies but big firms prefer to issue bonds to procure long-term funds," he said. Itoh said he expects the year-on-year M2 plus CD growth rate to remain at slightly below three percent in the next few months. -- Tokyo Treasury Desk 81-3-3432-9780
CCAT	Venezuela's capacity to respond to U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's call for more heating oil exports is limited by refinery flexibility, a top Venezuelan oil official said Wednesday. "There is a limited capacity to absorb this demand," Simon Antunez, director of technology at the Energy and Mines Ministry, told a news conference. The limited flexibility to raise distillate output is normally met from inventories, he added. Venezuela tends to produce more distillates at this time of year than at others, Antunez said. While not specifying Venezuela's distillates capacity Antunez said medium distillates account for between 15 and 20 percent of total refining capacity. Venezuela has a crude refining capacity of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) and shipped an average of 58,000 bpd of heating oil and diesel fuel to the United States last year, according to U.S. Department of Energy data. -- Maria Jose Gonzalez, Caracas newsroom, 582 505 2600

ECAT	A continued rise in energy prices boosted the overall producer price index (PPI) in November, but the more closely watched core rate barely rose, painting a benign picture of U.S. inflation, analysts said. "The report shows that core producer price inflation is well-behaved and any pressure that is out there is narrowly confined to the energy sector," said Raphael Marrone, money market economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. The Labor Department reported PPI rose 0.4 percent in November, but core PPI rose 0.1 percent.   Core PPI excludes volatile food and energy prices. "The divergence between food and energy prices and core prices has been an ongoing phenomenon this year," said Lee Youngdahl, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co Inc. Energy prices rose 2.3 percent in November, after rising 1.9 percent in October, the Labor Department reported. "It's something that bears watching because energy prices do influence the price of everything else, but future increases are likely to be more incremental," he added. Youngdahl says if modest U.S. growth rates continue, energy prices are unlikely to repeat their dramatic rise of 1996.   Strong crop yields in the fall helped food prices end their recent rise, economists said. Prices on consumer foods dropped by 0.1 percent in November, compared to a 0.8 percent rise in October. Despite the higher overall PPI number, the lower-than-expected 0.1 percent rise in core PPI grabbed economists' attention. The consensus forecast for core PPI had been for a rise of 0.2 percent.   Michelle Laughlin, Treasury market strategist for Prudential Securities Inc, noted that year-to-date, core PPI for 1996 was running at 0.6 percent which was close to reaching a record low. She said November's core rate was lower than many economists had expected because passenger car and light truck prices rose only 0.5 percent. "We were looking for a sharp swing in auto prices from the exagerated drop in October but instead they rose only moderately," Laughlin said.   Youngdahl said, "What makes this a pretty decent report is that it doesn't show any percolating pressures in the pipeline." He noted crude and intermediate goods prices, which often indicate the direction of future inflation, continued to remain low in November. Intermediate core goods rose by only 0.1 percent in November, while crude core goods registered their first decline in four months, falling by 0.3 percent, according to the Labor Department.   Nevertheless, Youndahl said he believed the short-term outlook for inflation would depend primarily on economic growth in the first half of 1997, which many market participants expect to show a rise from current levels. "If we see a surge (in GDP) to three percent or higher in the first half, inflationary pressures will start to show. These figures do not reflect that, however. We will have to wait and see," Youngdahl said. --Douglas Brown, 212-859-1662
CCAT	Northwest Pipeline Corp said on Sunday it did not expect any service disruptions as a result of a rupture and explosion on a natural gas transmission pipeline in Washington state. The 26-inch diameter pipeline ruptured late on Saturday night in a sparsely-populated area near Bellingham, 70 miles (110 kms) north of Seattle, local officials said. The natural gas exploded, sending flames leaping hundreds of feet into the air, Neil Clement, deputy director of Whatcom County Division of Emergency Management, said. The flames were "extremely spectacular," he said.   Clement said there were no injuries and damage appeared to be limited to the pipeline. He said there were no mandatory evacuations although a few people in nearby homes chose to leave. Crews quickly shut off valves on both sides of the rupture, stopping the natural gas flow to the affected part of the line, officials said. The remaining gas in the section of pipeline burned itself out during the night. The cause of the rupture was under investigation, said Northwest Pipeline, which operates the pipeline.   Northwest Pipeline spokesman John Nicksich said the company was one of the main providers of natural gas to the cities of the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The affected pipeline carried natural gas from Canada, he said. The company said it operates a 30-inch pipeline that runs parallel to the damaged line. "Northwest switched natural gas service to the 30-inch line and service to local gas customers was not disrupted. The company does not anticipate any service disruptions," the company said in a statement.   "The company has secured the area near the rupture and crews are evaluating the 30-inch line to ensure its continued safe operation. As soon as the evaluation is complete, Northwest will begin the necessary repairs to ensure the damaged pipeline can be put back into operation as quickly as possible," it said. Nicksich said that if no problems were found with the 30- inch pipeline, the company would increase pressure along that pipeline. If there were any shortfalls of natural gas, they could be made up with stored gas, he said. He said it would be Monday evening at the earliest before the 26-inch pipeline could be repaired and back in operation. Northwest, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, operates a 4,000-mile (6,400-km) high-pressure natural gas transmission system that originates in the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico and extends to the U.S.-Canadian border.

GCAT	Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko snubbed peace talks with his opponents organised by Moscow on Wednesday and refused to scrap a referendum on extending his powers. Lukashenko spoke for 40 minutes to President Boris Yeltsin, still recovering in hospital after a heart operation two weeks ago, but remained adamant that the referendum would go ahead on Sunday. "I will not give up the referendum. Thousands of people have already cast their votes. We will carry it to the end," he told electoral officials in Minsk. The talks in Smolensk, a Russian city halfway between Minsk and Moscow, went ahead without Lukashenko. His main opponent, parliament chairman Semyon Sharetsky, met Gennady Seleznyov and Yegor Stroyev, the leaders of Russia's two houses of parliament. Lukashenko's aides said he stayed away -- a slap in the face for Russia's mediation efforts -- because he was "very busy". "The president has decided not to go to Smolensk. He has an extremely tight schedule and so he has decided not to go," Mikhail Podgainy, head of information at the presidential administration, told Reuters. Lukashenko's closest aide, Vladimir Zametalin, said the president would not be going because Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, expected to attend, would not be there. However it was Chernomyrdin himself who first suggested the talks in a telephone conversation with Lukashenko on Tuesday. Aides said Lukashenko would spend Thursday campaigning in the Western city of Brest on the border with Poland, and might meet Chernomyrdin on Friday or Saturday. But Chernomyrdin's office said he would be spending Friday in Murmansk. The Belarus constitutional court, which like parliament has been at odds with Lukashenko for months, said it would start hearing parliament's impeachment case against him on Friday. Impeachment is unlikely however. A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to remove Lukashenko, who relies on support from a substantial minority of deputies. Sharetsky, before travelling to Smolensk, said parliament wanted Lukashenko to cancel the referendum, withdraw his proposed changes to the constitution and a series of illegal decrees, reinstate the sacked head of the Central Electoral Commission and give deputies television time. In return parliament would drop the impeachment moves. Sharetsky's press spokesman told Reuters that Yeltsin, who also spoke to him by telephone, had backed this "Zero Option" solution, but this could not be confirmed. Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Yeltsin's foreign affairs adviser Dmitry Ryurikov as saying political instability in Belarus would decline if the country could be integrated more closely with Russia. Lukashenko, recounting his own talk with the convalescent Russian president, said Yeltsin "admitted he was not sufficiently informed about the real situation in the republic." Interfax quoted Lukashenko as telling his parliamentary supporters the next step was up to his opponents and he would not back down until they withdrew the attempt to impeach him. Lukashenko's campaign for the referendum, in which early voting began on November 9, continued apace as the two sides spoke. Loudspeakers were heard in central Minsk, blasting out appeals to the population to vote and support Lukashenko. A defiant Lukashenko told his critics at a rally on Monday that he would not give up power to "adventurers" and they should prepare to "find another motherland" after the referendum. Lukashenko, who controls the security forces and most of the media and who enjoys considerable support among the mostly rural population of 10 million, has vowed to override any opposition. The presidents of neighbouring Lithuania, Ukraine and Poland issued a joint declaration on Wednesday expressing deep concern over the conflict in Belarus and calling for a constitutional solution and respect for human rights. The statement was signed by Poland's Aleksander Kwasniewski, Lithuania's Algirdas Brazauskas and Ukraine's Leonid Kuchma. The 42-year-old leader has scorned criticism from his neighbours and from the West but is heavily dependent on Russian economic support. He and Yeltsin agreed in April to unite their countries in a "community". Lukashenko is seeking authority to extend his term by more than two years and widen his powers over all institutions.
CCAT	Wickes Inc said Wednesday that, while it expects to report a profit for the second quarter, results will be below a year ago. Wickes earned $0.29 a share on sales of $228.8 million in the year-ago second quarter. The company also said it expects to report increased revenues and improved gross margin percentage for the second quarter. Total sales volume increased 3.7 percent versus the 1996 second quarter, it added.   The company said the projected decline in second quarter profit was due to more than $2.0 million in expenses related to several new growth initiatives. "Our goal is to continue to build existing and new relationships with the professional builder not only by meeting supply needs but by providing value added products and services," J. Steven Wilson, chairman, said in a statement. Wilson said Wickes is aiming to expand customer relationships in high growth markets, expand product mix and service capabilities in existing and new markets and to continue to expand value-added manufacturing capabilties.   Other objectives include expanding partnering relationships with builders and decreasing the impact of seasonality by expanding into new geographic markets. Wickes said its core business has historically been the distribution of building materials through a network of more than 100 building centers in 24 states. It also operates 12 component manufacturing facilities that produce pre-hung door units, window assemblies, roof and floor trusses and framed wall panels. During the quarter, Wickes began revitalizing several current and closed facilities where custom home builders, repair and remodel contractors and project do-it-yourself customers are dominant. Locations include Pascagoula, Miss., Phoenix, N.Y., and Grand Rapids, Mich. It also created a dedicated building material operation in Pensacola, Fla. Wickes said it is test marketing a number of new services for its customers under pilot programs, including utilities marketing and mortgage lending. "We realize that these kinds of investments may have an impact on earnings in the near term," Wilson said. "However, we hope to see these efforts begin to pay off in the near future."

ECAT	The Dutch Finance ministry said on Wednesday the cabinet was considering a tax reform proposal to increase tax liability for company managers holding lucrative share options. "The fiscal valuation (of profit on options) has been on the modest side and there has been a lot of publicity about top managers getting options and paying only 7.5 percent tax on the underlying share price," a spokeswoman said. She said there would be a fiscal exemption for employees with options worth up to 2,000 guilders from the start of the proposed reforms. The new rules were planned to come into force from January 1, 1998, she said. The spokeswoman said the tax office would then look at the market value of the options as well as the underlying stock. Holders who cash in their options within three years will have to count their profit on the options as part of their total taxable salary, she said. The state expects to gather an extra 10 million guilders in revenue annually through the planned reforms, which still have to receive official approval, she said. In April, Prime Minister Wim Kok raised the possibility of introducing a capital gains tax to be levied on increases in the value of shares or other assets. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000

The won closed at 827.60 after opening at 829.50. It fluctuated in a range of 827.30 to 829.60. Dealers said market talk that a local company would supply $110 million to the interbank market in the near future dampened the dollar buying sentiment. "The expectation killed the bids," said a trader at a European bank.   Traders expect a upward correction for the local unit on Thursday when the foreign capital inflow is seen materialising. A range of 825.00 to 827.60 is seen for Thursday with a base mid-rate of 828.00. Today's mid-rate stood at 828.60. -- JEAN YOON (822) 727 5643
CCAT	Excite Inc. said it and Ticketmaster Inc. will Monday announce a deal in which visitors to Excite's Web site will be able to buy tickets to events online through the Excite Network. The deal will enable fans to buy tickets to sports, theater, concert and family events directly through the Internet from Excite's entertainment, sports, My Excite, and travel channels by popularity, region and topic. "We are formalizing a relationship with Ticketmaster to make it easier for people to buy tickets from all of our Web sites," said Brett Bullington, executive vice president of Excite, which operates sites under the WebCrawler and Magellan search brands as well. Bullington said the companies would split revenues from advertising on co-branded pages on the service, but he declined to provide further financial details. Ticketmaster, which sold more than 60 million tickets last year with a gross sales value of nearly $2 billion, claims sales through its online site have risen by an average of nearly 25 percent a month since November to reach $2.5 million in May. The Excite deal, which Excite claims is the first of its type for an Internet search and navigation company with Ticketmaster, which has vigorously asserted rights to control links to its online material. In April the company challenged Microsoft Corp., arguing the software giant, based in Redmond, Wash., had been displaying Ticketmaster information on its Seattle Sidewalk site without permission. Recently, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen swapped his 47.5 percent share of Ticketmaster for 11 percent of HSN Inc., the operator of Home Shopping Network, in a transaction set to be valued at $209 million.

MCAT	Latvian shares gained slightly on Wednesday but the market remained sluggish, dealers said. Overall turnover was 68,000 lats, down slightly from 72,000 lats on Tuesday. Market capitalisation was 166.9 million lats. "The market is still stagnating...investors have been put off by poor financial results and privatisation looks like a better option than buying equities right now," Hansabank-Latvija dealer Andreta Petersone said. Despite the low volumes, the Rietumu index crept up by 0.53 percent to 175.13. Unibanka was the most active share in trade of 24,200 lats and its price fell slightly to 3.46 lats from 3.47 lats. The biggest gainer on the official list was Riga Transport Fleet, which rose to 1.23 lats from 1.20 on trade of 3,300 lats. Staburadze confectionery plant also rose, climbing to 2.70 lats from 2.69 lats in trade of 13,300 lats and dealers said it had room to go higher. "Based on Staburadze's first quarter results, one can forecast that its turnover and price direction will be more dynamic," Rietumu Bank's securities operations director, Dimtri Krutik, said. The company earlier told Reuters that its first quarter profit was 258,414 lats. Mangali Shipyard was the most active secondary market share in trade of 3,800 lats and its price rose to 1.17 lats from 1.16 lats despite posting a first quarter profit of only 41,000 lats. -- Ed Stoddard, Riga newsroom +371 721 52 40
GCAT	Roman Catholic bishops in Albania have called for elections later this month to be free and fair in order to restore peace in the tormented Balkan state, the Vatican said on Friday. The Albanian Bishops' Conference said in a statement, dated June 11 and released through the Vatican on Friday, it hoped the June 29 elections would end recent violence. "As the Church, we are in favour of an electoral campaign without hate and divisions, without tricks and scorn, but with tolerance and harmony," the bishops' statement said. "Throughout the turmoil lived by the Albanian people in recent months, we, as God's spiritual pastors, have told them to avoid destructive violence and to substitute it with harmony, reconciliation, tolerance and dialogue." Albania slid into chaos in February after dubious pyramid investment schemes collapsed, wiping out the savings of entire families. Parts of Albania -- especially in the south -- remain effectively out of government control after protestors angry with the financial fiasco raided state ammunition depots. Many Albanians have blamed the penury resulting from the crash on President Sali Berisha. He agreed under international pressure in March to set up a national unity government, headed by Prime Minister Bashkim Fino of the main opposition Socialist Party, to lead Albania to the early general elections. Italy is heading a United Nations-endorsed multinational force which has a mandate to protect humanitarian aid convoys and guard international observers to this month's polls.

MCAT	Wall Street's brief sally above 6,000 points in early trade on Monday lent some badly needed support to Europe's share markets which were showing signs of tiring as they held onto small gains. After touching 6,002.17 the Dow had slipped back below its opening level of around 5,993 by 1445 GMT amid worries that its rally may have become vulnerable to profit-taking. Earlier, London and Frankfurt both hit new highs as investors drew comfort from Friday's record-breaking trading sessions around the world. Dealers attributed the European gains to Friday's 60-point rise on Wall Street, which carried the Dow to a new closing high of 5,992.86 following weaker than expected U.S. jobs data. Investors worldwide celebrated the data, believing it would deter the U.S. Federal Reserve from a long-feared tightening of monetary policy. London and Frankfurt also closed at record highs on Friday. By 1445 GMT on Monday, however, London shares were up just 6.2 points at 4,031.0, having touched a new record of 4046.8 points. "There's still a lot of cash hanging about, but it seems like (fund managers) are sitting out at the moment...I don't think they will that much longer," one London share trader said. "There's no reason the market should tumble." Among individual stocks, shares in Shell Transport surged in active trading, amid news the oil giant was talking with Texaco about a potential merger of their downstream operations. The shares were up 21-1/2p to 1,020-1/2p. Shares in British Airways also rose on heavy volume on growing hopes the carrier would benefit from the possible development of a market in take-off and landing slots. British Airway shares were up 7-1/2p to 602p, after having risen as high as 617p initially. In Frankfurt, the DAX index rose 19.36 points to 2,702.64, a new record closing high. Most of the gains were accounted for by the market catching up with the screen-based DAX Ibis index which hit 2,704.25 in post-bourse trading on Friday. French shares were more restrained and were trading just below opening levels as the bourse continued to consolidate in the afternoon. Brokers said the market was technically well oriented, but was still digesting the market's recent climb to the 2,150 level. The dollar held steady against the mark and yen in early afternoon trade in Europe, little changed from morning levels and with few fresh factors on the horizon to push it out of its recent ranges. Against the yen it was trading at 111.23 at 1445 GMT compared with 111.55 in late European trade on Friday. Overnight, it touched a session high of 111.95 yen. The market shrugged off comments made overnight by senior Japanese politicians calling for a rise in interest rates after the general election, scheduled for October 20. Analysts said the comments were being taken as electioneering designed to woo Japanese savers disgruntled with the country's low interest rates. Little follow-through on such promises is expected until after the election. CURRENCIES AT 1445 GMT The dollar was at 111.23 yen and 1.5297 marks versus Friday's late European levels of 111.55 yen and 1.5304 marks. STOCK MARKETS AT 1445 GMT The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was 6.2 points higher at 4,031.0. In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was 1.03 down at 2,151.66. The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was 19.36 higher at 2,702.64, while the DAX Ibis was 0.16 points lower at 2,704.09. PRECIOUS METALS AT 1400 GMT Gold fixed at $380.10 compared with the morning fix of $379.60 and Friday's close of $380.45.
GCAT	Former World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis looks likely to have the chance of regaining his title early in the new year following a court ruling in the United States on Thursday. His manager Frank Maloney said on Friday two possible dates, January 24 and February 1, were being lined up for a re-match with American Oliver McCall, the man who took the title from him in 1994 with a second round knockout. Maloney said Lewis could also have home advantage with London being the likely venue and Atlantic City as an alternative. Attempts to stage the fight have met with a series of delays but on Thursday an American court ruled that promoter Don King, who originally won the right to put on the fight, had failed to stage the event in time. The court awarded the promotion rights to the second highest bidder, Lewis's American promoters Main Events. The title is currently vacant, with Maloney having lost it to Briton Frank Bruno who was then beaten by Mike Tyson who in turn relinquished it. Lewis and McCall will each receive around $2 million for the fight instead of the $3 million under the contract with King, but with the compensation of a possible huge payday in prospect. The winner could be lined up to face Evander Holyfield, shock winner over Tyson last weekend, with purse money of up to $20 million.
CCAT	SembCorp Ltd's plans to build a 600-megawatt power plant in Singapore through joint venture Sembawang Utilities and Terminals Pte Ltd (SUT) are expected to be finalised this year, company officials said on Monday. SUT is building a Singapore $250 million utilities centre on Pulau Sakra, one of seven islands to be merged to form Jurong island for the site of a large petrochemical centre. "SUT still intends to build a cogeneration plant with 600 megawatt power generating capacity for the phase two of the utilities centre development," said Tan Mong Seng, chairman and president of SembEC.   "We hope to make a decision within this year," Tan said. Industry sources said the company was talking to Indonesia and Malaysia for possible natural gas supplies. SUT is a joint venture between SembCorp's engineering and construction unit, SembEC, Belgium's Powerfin S.A., JTC International Pte Ltd and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. Tan said SUT was awaiting details of the Singapore government's plans to deregulate the power supply market in 1998. The government is expected to make an announcement this year.   SUT has been in negotitations with the Public Utilities Board as well as PowerGrid, the Singapore Power subsidiary which will manage electricity distribution, on the cogeneration plant's potential supplies to users. The project would make SUT one of the first independent power prducers in Singapore. The plant is expected to take about 27-28 months to complete once approvals are given, Tan said. -- Angela Tan, Singapore newsroom (65 8703083)
ECAT	Brazil's Ministry of Industry and Commerce has recommended setting up special credit lines to help specific sectors of the national industry restructure and cope with foreign competition, a senior official said. Antonio Sergio Martins de Mello, secretary of industrial policy at the ministry, said the aim was to boost competitiveness, but that greater protection against imports in the form of higher tariffs or other barriers was not in the cards. "We believe the best protection is increased competitiveness," Mello told Reuters.   A report by the ministry, which singles out 15 sectors for special aid, is being studied by the Finance Ministry. The recommendations follow a series of measures, such as limited credit lines and the reestablishment of an export insurance agency, designed to boost overseas sales and plug a widening trade gap, seen at up to $5.2 billion in 1996. The 15 areas identified as in need of some help are capital goods, electronics, car parts, textiles, leather and shoes, metals, chemicals, marine construction, furniture, paper and cellulose, agricultural machinery, information technology, toys, fishing and civil construction.   Several of those sectors, in particular the toy and textile industries, have already won tariff safeguards from Brasilia, leading to some concern among Brazil's international trading partners of a step back from trade liberalization. But Mello said tariff measures would only be applied in cases of unfair trading and not as an instrument to boost the fortunes of local businesses. "We are talking only about restructuring (industries) here," he said. Newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo Monday quoted the economic policy secretary of the Finance Ministry, Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros, as ruling out any "protectionist" moves. "The basic instrument of trade policy will not be tariffs, but the use of credit mechanisms and restructuring," Mendonca de Barros told the newspaper.

GCAT	Swedish automotive group AB Volvo said on Monday it would stop sponsoring the show jumping and dressage world cups at the end of next season. "The dressage finals in Gothenburg on April 2-5 1998 and the show jumping finals in Helsinki 16-19 April 1998 will be the end of Volvo's focus on equestrian sports," the company said in a statement. Volvo has been the main sponsor for the show jumping  World Cup since 1978 and the dressage World Cup since 1990. "It is natural that a close-to 20-year-old project should be considered carefully ahead of a possible renewal and in this case, after consulting our marketing companies and importers around the world, we found we should not use the option to extend the contract," a company spokesman said.
GCAT	The Ukrainian parliament on Thursday ratified a key friendship treaty with Romania that is being challenged by judges in the Romanian Supreme Court. The treaty, signed on June 2 by presidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and Emil Constantinescu of Romania, confirms the existing borders between two states and Ukraine's authority over the territories lost by Romania before World War Two. In 1940 the Soviet Union seized southern Bessarabia and northern Bukovina under a pact with Nazi Germany. In 1948 it also gained the tiny but strategically important Serpent Island in the Black Sea. The treaty, already ratified by the Romanian parliament, was praised by U.S. President Bill Clinton during his visit to Bucharest last week. It also boosted Romania's image in the West but did not get Bucharest included in the first wave of NATO enlargement alongside Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Seventeen of 34 judges in Romania's Supreme Court said on Tuesday they had issued a challenge to the treaty, contending that it violated the 1991 constitution proclaiming the country as a "...unitary and indivisible state". A court spokesman said the challenge had little hope of success as it was submitted after Constantinescu signed the treaty into law. REUTER

CCAT	Chirsoscience Group Plc said on Thursday it had been granted a key patent for the use of Levobupivacaine which will remain in place until 2014. The patent, European Patent No EP 0723445, could be used on people with heart problems.   Levobupivacaine is a purified version of an existing long-acting local anaesthetic, bupivacaine. Chiroscience said its version of the drug also cut down on central nervous system side effects as well as heart problems. The company said it had filed 18 separate patent applications for the drug, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials. The company said it planned its first approval application for the drug in Europe at the end of 1997. Chiroscience's share price was marked at 373 1/2 pence, seven pence higher from its Wednesday's close with more than a million shares traded by 1120 GMT. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 4366
ECAT	Finance Minister Bill Birch said on Friday the government's growth forecasts released in Thursday's Budget were not too optimistic, after the release of lower expectations by the Reserve Bank. Treasury projected growth of 2.4 percent in the 1997/98 year and 4.2 percent in 1998/99 before seeing it ease to 3.5 percent in 1999/2000. "That is not overly optimistic," Birch said in a speech to a business lunch meeting.   "By 1998-9 the key factors all work in one direction -- to improve the rate of growth," Birch said. He noted the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research had estimated growth of 4.3 percent for that year. "The Reserve Bank in its release this morning forecasts growth of between 3.5 percent and 4.0 percent in 1998/99 and 1999/2000," Birch said, without commenting further. On Friday the Reserve Bank released its projections showing growth of 2.0 percent in 1997/98, 3.6 percent in 1998/99 and 3.8 percent in 1999/2000.   "Lower interest rates, a more stable exchange rate, a positive low-inflation outlook, more government spending, further tax cuts in July 1998 and a strong world economy will work to improve business conditions," Birch said. He said the 4.2 percent growth rate predicted by Treasury for the 1998/99 year was in line with world average growth levels. Birch said the rebound would start later this year kick- started by previous interest rates cuts which had fallen three percentage points since October.   Birch reiterated the government had committed NZ$3.3 billion of the coalition government's planned $5 billion in spending over the next three years, but more than $1 billion of the committed funds have been held in contingency. "Some of that billion dollars is there to cover a negotiated settlement of a future unified pay scale for teachers. Some of it covers area of policy still being crystallized," Birch said. The centre right coalition government tabled its first Budget on Thursday, outlining a planned surplus of $1.5 billion and $900 million of extra spending in the 1997/98 year. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 473 4746
ECAT	Iran plans to pay back $9.943 billion of its total debt of almost $22 billion in the current Iranian year which ends on March 20, 1997, the daily Iran News said on Sunday. Quoting central bank figures, the newspaper said Iran's debt stood at $21.928 billion in the year 1995/6, $4.536 billion of which was short-term and the balance medium- and long-term debt. It said Iran would repay $4.606 billion in 1997/8, $3.958 billion in 1998/9 and $2.635 billion in 1999/2000. In 2000/1 and 2001/2, $635 million and $49 million respectively would be repaid. Iran will start repaying the balance of $102 million in 2002, the paper said.

CCAT	San Miguel Corp (SMC) of the Philippines will find it hard to post stronger profits this year because of a declining peso and lower beer prices, analysts said on Thursday. "Margins will definitely be sacrificed from lower beer prices. The depreciation of the peso would impact on raw material costs plus consumers will be squeezed because inflation would move up," said an analyst of a foreign brokerage house, who asked not to be identified. Analysts said they were largely disappointed with the earnings performance of SMC, which earlier on Thursday reported a 20 percent rise in first half net income to 2.89 billion pesos from the year-ago 2.41 billion pesos. Raul Ruiz, vice president of Sun Hung Kai Securities, said he would likely maintain a lower net profit forecast for SMC this year at a recurring 4.6 billion pesos compared with last year's 5.3 billion pesos. Second quarter profits were mostly shored up by a deal with Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCA), analysts said. In April this year, SMC exchanged its 70 percent stake in Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc (CCBPI) for a 25 percent equity in CCA. "There were a lot of exceptional items. The second quarter was down year-on- year," another analyst said. SMC said its soft drinks interest delivered total profits of 651 million pesos, of which 560 million pesos came from the sale on inventories of packaging products to CCBPI. For the rest of the year, SMC would have to grapple with the effects of the peso on its imported raw material prices, foreign currency loan payments and lower spending power of consumers which would impact on margins and sales, analysts said. The peso was devalued three weeks ago when it fell prey to currency speculation in the region caused by Thailand's financial woes. But Raphael Manalaysay, research head of Socgen-Crosby UBP Securities, said investors should not be too worried about the impact of the peso. "SMC has forward contracts," he said. Also, he said SMC had earnings from abroad which should take care of its foreign exchange costs. Its international operations on beer and packaging account for 15 percent of revenues, he said. SMC's decision to cut beer prices in July would result in lower margins but SMC had said it hoped to offset this with a 20 percent increase in volume of domestic beer sales. Analysts said this segment accounted for 31 percent of revenues. "There may be a pleasant surprise from domestic beer sales," Manalaysay said. "There seems to be encouraging signs of increased take-up from the price adjustments." Socgen-Crosby so far projected SMC to post a net income of 4.74 billion pesos this year. -- Manila newsroom (63 2) 841-8937

GCAT	The leader of Burma's main ethnic guerrillas, the Karen National Union (KNU), on Tuesday urged ASEAN nations not to accept the country as a member of the regional grouping. General Bo Mya said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should not accept Burma as a member because he said it was still run by a "military dictatorship". "The KNU is strongly opposed to the SLORC's plan to apply for membership of ASEAN and we are appealing to ASEAN nations not to accept a country that is still run by a military dictatorship to be one of its members," the 67-year old KNU leader told reporters at this jungle base in southeastern Burma near the Thai border. He was referring to Burma's ruling military body, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Malaysia's foreign minister Abdullah Badawi said earlier Burma made a formal application for full membership of ASEAN. The Malaysian national news agency Bernama quoted Abdullah as saying on Tuesday that Burmese Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw handed over the application last month during a visit to Kuala Lumpur by Burmese junta leader General Than Shwe. Malaysia is the current chairman of ASEAN, which also groups Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Burma was accepted as an official observer in July. Bo Mya, whose KNU has been fighting for autonomy from Rangoon, said if ASEAN accepted Burma it would legitimise the SLORC, which has been widely accused of human rights abuses. "To be a member of ASEAN means democratic countries and world communities recognise the dictatorship and that only will bring more hardship to the Burmese people," he said. The KNU was formed in 1948 after Burma became independent from Britain and is the last major rebel group left fighting for autonomy from Rangoon. Despite several rounds of peace talks with the SLORC, an agreement has yet to be made because the military has insisted on unconditional surrender, Bo Mya said.

GCAT	By Nicholas Doughty, Diplomatic Correspondent The United States and Russia prepared for their toughest summit since the end of the Cold War on Wednesday, with both sides staking out resolute positions in the row over NATO enlargement. A senior Russian official said Moscow would not drop its bitter opposition to NATO's enlargement plans, after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright vowed the alliance would not be deterred from taking in former Soviet bloc states. Seen as the most difficult challenge for European security in the 21st century, NATO enlargement tops the agenda for the meeting on Thursday and Friday between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Helsinki. It now seems unlikely there will be an agreement on this in Helsinki, although Russian and U.S. officials are suggesting there could be progress in other areas, including arms control and economic issues that are of profound concern to Moscow. Yeltsin's decisive shift towards youthful reformers in this week's cabinet reshuffle, no doubt well-timed for the summit, has won lavish praise from Washington and could open the way for more Western help with the economy. Both sides have staked out their positions on NATO, in a sometimes confusing game of diplomatic poker which mixes the usual tough bargaining with hints of possible compromise. Moscow says enlargement will isolate Russia, although Yeltsin does not want a return to Cold War-style tensions. At a Madrid summit in July, the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) will invite some former Soviet bloc states to start membership talks, probably Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The intention is that they join in 1999. "Russia's approach to NATO expansion will not change regardless of any summits, bilateral meetings and negotiations," Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told reporters in the Finnish capital on Wednesday, where snow had begun to fall. "From our side we will, up to the last minute, insist on our right to a negative approach to this plan," he said. But he also said the summit offered the chance to "lay down an outline for Russian-American partnership in the 21st century" and praised NATO for showing signs of understanding Russia's security concerns about its former Cold War foe. "We express very careful optimism," Yastrzhembsky said. Washington has taken a similar approach. Taking a hard line, Albright said on Tuesday NATO enlargement would go ahead on schedule and Moscow would not be allowed to prevent more countries joining in future, although it would have a voice in European security affairs. Clinton said there was a "tough agenda" but he was optimistic. The leaders, meeting for the 11th time, have a good working relationship although they have not held talks for almost a year. "We never had a meeting that didn't result in constructive progress," Clinton said Tuesday. Yeltsin, on fighting form after months of illness and last year's heart surgery, has made fun of the fact that Clinton will be the obvious invalid in Helsinki, either in a wheelchair or on crutches following surgery for a knee injury last week. Yeltsin must be careful not to appear weak in front of his communist and nationalist critics, who dominate Russia's parliament, the Duma. Clinton, on the other hand, wants to demonstrate U.S. leadership by winning Russia over on NATO. Russia wants legally binding commitments in the NATO relationship, including guarantees that allied troops and nuclear arms will not be deployed in new member states. NATO is offering Russia a new relationship through a special charter, which would give Moscow the right to consultation on security issues but no power of veto over the alliance's plans. There are also problems with arms control, which is intimately linked with the NATO issue and with Russia's perception that it is faced by potential enemies. Yeltsin and Clinton will discuss changes to a landmark 1990 treaty on conventional forces in Europe and the deadlock over nuclear weapons.
GCAT	Senate committee leaders vowed on Thursday to find out whether the Pentagon tried to cover up Gulf War troops' possible war gas exposure and one said retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf had logs that could help. "We are concerned as to what the Department of Defence did," Senate Veterans Committee Chairman Arlen Specter said at a hearing on Gulf War illnesses. "Was it indifference? Was it carelessness? Was it recklessness? Was it a cover up? And that we intend to pursue in depth." The committee's senior Democrat, Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, said he personally believed someone deliberately got rid of official military logs for the eight days in March 1991 when U.S. troops unknowingly blew up chemical weapons in an Iraqi arms dump, exposing up to 20,000 troops to the war gas. But he said retired Gulf War commander Schwarzkopf had his own personal logs of what happened during that period and had not made them public. "I happen to think those eight days (of official logs) were disposed of for ill purposes," Rockefeller said. "... I have no proof of that. That's my view. But certainly those eight days are going to be covered by the (Schwarzkopf) log." Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon lashed out at the senators' suggestions both of a Pentagon coverup and of the possibility that the Schwarzkopf logs might show whether the military knew in 1991 of troops' possible gas war exposure. "I think this is a wild goose chase, frankly, on your part and also on the parts of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Specter," Bacon told reporters in response to questions about the Schwarzkopf logs. He said Schwarzkopf has said repeatedly that he had no evidence of any chemical exposure to U.S. troops in the Gulf, and said a presidential panel reported this week that it had found no evidence of a Gulf illness cover-up. Bacon said that although Schwarzkopf had received a ruling from government lawyers that the logs were his personal property, he offered on Dec. 23 to allow Pentagon investigators to come to his home in Tampa to examine them. Bacon said the department would send someone to look at the retired commander's complete logs. Defence officials said Schwarzkopf had also offered to allow representatives from both Rockefeller's and Specter's offices to see the logs. An official at the Pentagon said earlier this week that it hoped to report shortly on its inquiry into what happened to the eight days of March 1991 logs that were missing. Those logs, kept by Schwarzkopf's command headquarters in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, covered both March 4 and March 10, 1991, dates that U.S. troops blew up the Iraqi arms dump which investigators now say contained sarin and mustard gas weapons.
CCAT	Harnischfeger Industries Inc's $19 a share tender offer for industrial tool and systems maker Giddings & Lewis Inc could be about the best offer Giddings can get, industry analysts said Monday. "I don't think there's much more in that Harnischfeger bid than what's in there, and I don't think there's anyone else out there" that would make a higher bid, Thomas Burns Jr., analyst at NatWest Securities, said.   Shares of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin-based Giddings & Lewis jumped 6-3/4 to 20-3/8 Monday. That was seen as an indication that some buyers expect a higher bid, a view many analysts take issue with. "My feeling is at $19 a share, that's full value, I think, for Giddings & Lewis," said William Cooke, analyst at McDonald & Co. "I think that Harnischfeger is assuming they can double the earnings of Giddings & Lewis in the not too distant future. I think they're being optimistic."   Harnischfeger said it is looking at using Giddings & Lewis to expand in the fragmented industrial products aftermarket service business, which Harnischfeger estimates as an $80 billion market. But some analysts said buying Giddings & Lewis, a company that took a $64.1 million charge last year to try to fix its integrated automation systems business, adds a lot of uncertainty for Harnischfeger shareholders.   "...we believe that investors will be looking at a fundamentally different company with much more risk involved than they had previously," J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosworth, wrote in a research note, in which he also lowered the rating of Harnischfeger to a hold from a buy. While saying the Harnischfeger bid was not a done deal, "we expect (Harnischfeger) to pursue its target with vigor and would be suprised if another offer significantly higher than the one now on the table would surface," Brumley said.   Some analysts said Harnischfeger has picked a perfect time to go after Giddings & Lewis. Giddings has already taken steps to fix its underperforming operations, but the stock, in their opinion, still is ailing, they said. "They got all the dirty work behind them," said Darren Bagwell, analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co Inc. "They've wiped the slate clean, and yet the stock price still reflects that wait and see attitude." In fact, Bagwell also said Giddings & Lewis could probably squeeze a higher bid out of somebody and said he felt the company was worth more than $19 a share. Some analysts also noted that Harnischfeger's bid was likely based only on publicly available information and that a bidder who had a good look at Giddings & Lewis books might find information to convince them to make a higher offer. Harnischfeger shares were down 3-5/8 at 41-3/4 Monday. ((Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787))
GCAT	Australia coach Greg Smith has played down the risk involved in switching Tim Horan to an unfamiliar fly-half role in the first test against France on Saturday. Smith's strategy of taking on France at their own running game will depend heavily on the success of his bold gamble in switching Horan from his normal test position at centre. "With his experience and collective skills, we believe Tim is worth a go in the number 10 jersey," Smith said. "We need a fly-half who will take us into the future...I doubt very much that Tim Horan will fail." Horan, who has played all but two of his 47 tests in the centre, was preferred at number 10 ahead of specialist fly-halves David Knox, Scott Bowen and Elton Flatley. Horan admitted his selection could be regarded as a gamble by the Wallabies given his lack of experience in the position. "I suppose it could be seen that way but I feel confident about taking on the job," the Queensland veteran said. Smith has opted for speed and mobility in his team selection with the aim of attacking the Five Nations champions from all positions. Australia will try to match French attacking flair with a game that relies on each player being capable of running at speed at opponents, he said. "We will try to do the same. We've picked 15 players who are all mobile and who can all have an impact with the ball. Horan, whose tackling strength was thought to be a key factor in his being preferred to Knox, said his priority would be defence. "My aim every time I go out on the field is not to miss a tackle," said Horan, whose previous appearances for Australia outside the centres were on the wing. "I've got to make sure my defence is capable of stopping them before the advantage line," said Horan, who played at full-back for Queensland during this year's Super 12 competition. Smith rated France and South Africa on a par as rugby powers, behind only New Zealand in his estimation. France coach Jean-Claude Skrela said France would not be trying to prove a point for European rugby against Australia. Asked whether the result would indicate the relative strength of northern and southern hemisphere rugby," Skrela said:"We are not playing for Europe or for the Five Nations, we are playing only for France." Skrela was forced to shuffle his back line after injuries ruled out centre Christophe Lamaison and fly-half Alain Penaud. Richard Dourthe was named in midfield while David Aucagne comes in at fly-half in two of the six changes from the side that clinched the Five Nations grand slam in March. Lock Olivier Brouzet forced his way into the side at the expense of Hugues Miorin, while prop Christian Califano returns after missing one game because of suspension. Winger Philippe Bernat-Salles was also recalled and Philippe Carbonneau was named at scrum-half. France, who have beaten Queensland, ACT and Victoria so far on tour, will face Australia in the second and final test in Brisbane on June 28. Teams: France - 15-Jean-Luc Sadourny; 14-Philippe Bernat-Salles, 13-Richard Dourthe, 12-Thomas Castaignede, 11-David Venditti; 10-David Aucagne, 9-Philippe Carbonneau; 8-Fabien Pelous, 7-Olivier Magne, 6-Abdel Benazzi (captain), 5-Olivier Merle, 4-Olivier Brouzet, 3-Christian Califano, 2-Marc Dal Maso, 1-Franck Tournaire. Australia - 15-Stephen Larkham; 14-Ben Tune, 13-Jason Little, 12-Pat Howard, 11-Joe Roff; 10-Tim Horan, 9-George Gregan; 8-Daniel Manu, 7-David Wilson, 6-Brett Robinson, 5-John Eales (captain), 4-David Giffen, 3-Ewen McKenzie, 2-Marco Caputo, 1-Richard Harry.
ECAT	Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Tuesday that Japan will not depend on fiscal spending as a measure to stimulate its economy. He told a news conference that Japan will deregulate its economy to achieve economic growth led by domestic demand.   Hashimoto made the remarks after his cabinet approved fiscal reform plans which call for a 0.5 percent cut in the fiscal 1998/99 budget from the current budget. Asked if the plan not to use fiscal spending to stimulate the economy runs counter to a U.S. request to expand Japan's domestic demand with additional fiscal spending, Hashimoto said: "The fiscal reform plan will bring about an increase in domestic demand over the medium and long term". Washington has argued that Japan should expand its economic growth so as to absorb more imports to help cut its trade deficit with the United States. Hashimoto added that Japan's surplus in trade and services will not expand to a level which will hurt Tokyo's stable relations with Washington unless there are extreme fluctuations in exchange rates.   Hashimoto said the fiscal reform plans approved on Tuesday will help the government achieve a target of bringing down the fiscal deficit to less than three percent of gross domestic product by fiscal 2003. "Without fiscal reform, we cannot have the prospect of a revitalised society in the 21st century," Hashimoto said.
CCAT	Norwegian pharmaceuticals group Nycomed ASA said on Wednesday restructuring costs and price pressure on a key product helped slash 1996 net profits. Net profits shrank to 104 million crowns from 1.16 billion in 1995. But the company, reaffirming plans unveiled last year, said it expected to make savings of 600 million crowns per year before tax with full effect from 1998. Nycomed A and B shares were up in early trade on the Oslo Bourse following the release of the results.   Pre-tax profits excluding restructuring costs in 1996 were 1.17 billion crowns, down from 1.69 billion crowns in 1995. In the accounts, the company allocated 800 million crowns for restructuring costs linked to Fokus '98, the programme implemented in the fourth quarter last year to reduce costs. Operating revenues fell eight percent to 7.74 billion crowns. "The main reason for the decline in operating revenues was a the price pressure on contrast media, which to some degree has been offset by higher sales volumes," a company statement said. The operating profit before Research & Development costs was 2.23 billion crowns, down from 2.85 billion in 1995. R&D costs fell to 896 million crowns from 931 million. Nycomed last October reported a 32 percent drop in nine-month pre-tax profits and blamed the decline on lower U.S. sales for Omnipaque, its main X-ray contrast agent. Under Focus '98, Nycomed plans to adjust group strategy to reduce costs in some areas and increase investment in others, while strengthening core activities. The board said it would propose a dividend of three crowns per share for 1996 to the annual general meeting. The drug company, one of the largest in Scandinavia, has been under pressure to rethink strategy since last June when it warned that intensive competition in the North American market for diagnostic contrast agents would have a severe impact on group revenues in 1996. Nycomed was demerged from energy group Hafslund ASA in May last year and listed separately on the Oslo bourse. --Rolf Soderlind, Oslo newsroom, +47 22 42 50 41
CCAT	Personal computer maker Tulip Computers NV said on Monday it expected a profit for the full-year 1997 but added the first half of the year would probably not yet be profitable. "The management expects a positive result can be realised for the full-year 1997. But the result for the first half of 1997 may not be positive," the company said in a statement. The Netherlands' only computer manufacturer earlier posted a 1996 net loss of 10.0 million guilders, compared with a profit of 9.2 million in 1995.

CCAT	South Korea's Taehwa Shopping Co Ltd filed an application with a Pusan court on Monday to protect the company from its creditors, a Securities Supervisory Board statement said. The statement said high financing costs caused the company to file the application for court receivership. Analysts said Taehwa Shopping, based in the port city of Pusan, had faced worsening financial problems since department stores run by the nation's large conglomerates or chaebol opened outlets in Pusan, leading to fierce competition.   Analysts said Taehwa Shopping had invested substantial amounts to expand its department store and to build more branches. Taehwa Shopping posted 14.67 billion won in net loss on 144.92 billion turnover in calendar 1996 from a 3.02 billion profit on 180.51 billion sales a year earlier. The statement said Taehwa's assets totalled 296.39 billion won with 260.75 billion in liabilities last year. It showed Taehwa's corporate bond issuances, which mature on December 21, 1999, totalled 69 billion won.   The Korea Stock Exchange halted trading in Taehwa Shopping through Monday. The bourse said it would resume trade in the shares from Wednesday but the shares would be placed on a supervision list. -- Seoul Newsroom (822) 727 5647
ECAT	South Africa has signed two project agreements worth $6 million with the United Nations' Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa, the programme said on Thursday. More than 3,000 South Africans are to benefit from the agreements to provide financial support mainly to blacks disadvantaged under apartheid for tertiary education and for training to upgrade qualifications, it said in a statement.  "Our commitment is to complement the government's efforts to provide qualified cadres needed to build the country's socio- economic development," said the programme's coordinator, Angela Masithela.
MCAT	British gilts stole a march on Australian bonds to offer the best returns in the week to June 5 in the Salomon Brothers world government bond index (WGBI), Salomon's said on Friday. Gilts offered returns of 0.80 percent and Australian bonds 0.79 percent in local currency terms. These were closely followed by French bonds which rallied early in the week unconcerned by the unexpected success of the Socialist Party in the French election on Sunday. OATs made gains of 0.75 percent in French franc terms. The total WGBI showed gains of 0.63 percent in a week where the benefits of a surprise interest rate cut in Australia on May 23, filtered through to the bond market. In Europe politics cast a shadow of doubt over the future of the European single currency, dampening enthusiasm for continental European government debt but shoring up U.S. Treasuries ahead of the key U.S. payrolls numbers later in the session. German Bunds, Italian BTPs and Spanish bonos all made investors gains of 0.64 percent in local currency terms, offering the same returns as U.S. Treasuries. The only losers this week were Swiss bonds, which showed a loss of 0.12 percent in local currency terms. Japanese government bonds brought returns of 0.56 percent in yen terms. But in U.S. dollar terms JGBs made the second highest gains of the week at 0.90 percent, just behind Canadian bonds returns of 0.94 percent. Salomon's bond index is calculated using all government bonds with over one year to maturity, weighted for market capitalisation. Only bonds freely available to institutional investors and with a certain minimum amount outstanding are included. Returns take account of price moves and accrued interest. --International bonds unit + 44 171 542 4041
GCAT	After two weeks of partisan wrangling, the Senate on Wednesday confirmed President Bill Clinton's nomination of Alexis Herman as labor secretary, a cabinet office that has been vacant for three and a half months. The Senate's Republican leaders took the confirmation vote soon after a deal was cut in which the Clinton administration agreed to drop a planned executive order on using project labor agreements for federal construction projects that business groups said would discriminate against non-union contractors. Instead, the White House will issue a memorandum to federal agencies that it said will achieve the same purpose as the order, but which business groups called a major concession. Herman, 49, who had been director of the White House Office of Public Liaison, was confirmed on a 85-13 vote. She succeeds Robert Reich, who left the Labor Department on Jan. 12 after four years. Clinton lauded the Senate's strong backing of Herman. "There was never any question that she was highly qualified to be secretary of labor," the president said in a statement. "She understands the needs of workers and understands the challenges they face as we approach the 21st century." Herman, the first black woman to head the department, won a unanimous recommendation by the Senate Labor Committee on April 10 after undergoing months of scrutiny over her links to President Clinton's re-election campaign fundraising efforts. But Senate Republican leaders halted the confirmation process about two weeks ago after a draft of the proposed presidential order surfaced. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney charged that the standoff was calculated by Republicans to keep the Labor Department rudderless for a longer period of time. "By dragging their feet with one partisan excuse after another, the Republican Senate leadership has kept the Labor Department without a new leader for four months," he said. Project labor agreements are deals negotiated by contractors and unions before the start of a project that cover wages and terms and conditions of employment for the duration of the project. Republicans, prodded by business groups, objected to the order, arguing that it was a payoff to unions for their vigorous political support of Clinton and many Democratic candidates and that it amounted to a mandate for federal agencies to use union workers and contractors. The administration, however, maintained that the order was within the president's authority to issue, was entirely voluntary for federal agencies and would not require them to channel the government's $60 billion a year construction budget exclusively to union contractors and workers. In agreeing to issue a memorandum instead of an order, White House spokesman Barry Toiv said the administration conceded only on the duration of its message. Memoranda last only for the duration of the president's term, while executive orders remain in effect afterwards, he said. "Since this is something to encourage agencies rather than be mandatory for agencies, we believe it substantively accomplishes the same goal," said Toiv. But business groups claimed victory, saying the memorandum would not have same effect of requiring agencies to use union labor that they said the executive order would have. "The withdrawal of this proposed executive order is an outright victory for American taxpayers, construction workers and businesses," said U.S. Chamber of Commerce Senior Vice President Bruce Josten. "It is a repudiation of big labor's attempt to buy, with political contributions, a union monopoly of government construction projects." One business group official said the memorandum was "in effect a fig leaf given to the unions that didn't carry the same force as an executive order." But Democrats and union officials said they were pleased with the deal, which they said kept the original intent of the executive order intact. "We're seeing a very energetic spin control effort on the Republican side," said Gerry Shea, an assistant to Sweeney. "This was not an attempt to force an agency to do it. It's an effort to say there's no problem with doing it." Senate Deputy Republican leader Don Nickles of Oklahoma, his party's point man on the issue, said the administration's memorandum will remind federal agencies that project labor agreements may legally be used if justified by time, cost and labor-management stability considerations.
CCAT	Italy plans to trim its vast network of retail  petrol pump outlets by some 5,000 over the next two years in a plan  worked out this week by industry body Unione Petrolifera (UP). The voluntary plan agreed with individual petrol companies and service  station owners aims to thin out the national network by concentrating  on closing the less efficient and poorly situated retail outlets. The project envisages a scheme of incentives and compensation for  the closure of outlets. Italy has over 28,000 service stations, or nearly 10 per 100 square  km, the largest network in Europe. UP's project will now be submitted to the Industry Ministry and is  expected to go before parliament as a bill in autumn. UP chairman Pasquale de Vita said the move was a major step forward  in streamlining the country's retail network. "We are trying to get  Italy's network more in line with others in Europe." Currently some 81 percent of Italian petrol station income came from  fuel sales, eight percent from other services and just 11 percent  from "non oil" sales. This compared to a European average of 33 percent, 14 percent and  54 percent respectively. De Vita said the project would allow petrol stations to diversify  their range of services and therefore income. "It is also in the interests of consumers because a network providing  a wider range of services is also more economical from the management  point of view," he said adding that the streamlining should eventually  result in lower petrol prices. -- Milan newsroom +392 66129589

CCAT	Standard & Poor's said on Friday it has assigned its A2 rating to Central & South West Corp's commercial paper programme. S&P said the paper was backed by a $800 million five-year and a $400 million 364-day bank agreement led by Morgan Guaranty Trust. Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch are the commercial paper dealers, S&P said in a statement. "The rating reflects the creditworthiness of the consolidated company, which is judged to be an A minus credit," S&P said.   S&P said credit strength is derived from U.S. operating subsidiaries Central Power & Light Co (A senior secured debt), Public Service Co of Oklahoma (A plus senior secured debt), West Texas Utilities Inc (A plus senior secured debt), and Southwestern Electric Power Co. (AA minus senior secured debt). "These ratings, however, carry negative outlooks, and will likely be lowered one notch to reflect the impact of regulatory actions in Texas and Oklahoma," S&P said. --International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 4041
CCAT	South African mining house JCI Ltd posted slightly better results on Wednesday for the six months to end-December period and looked forward to further profit growth for the rest of the year. "JCI has continued to make good progress in its endeavours towards growing its operating assets base during the period," JCI's managing director Bill Nairn told a news conference. "Some sacrifice of short term earnings has been necessary in pursuance of this objective. Nonetheless, despite this and a weaker gold price, the sustainable earnings forecast for the financial year under current market conditions should show an improvement on the 1996 results," he added. JCI's half year attributable profit rose to 253 million rand from 127 million rand last time, while headline earnings per share climbed from 111 cents to 115 cents. JCI's gold earnings showed some light despite a dulled bullion price which continue to dog sales of the precious metal. JCI's coal and base metal division increased profits for the six month period from 54 million rand to 67 million rand, Nairn said, adding market conditions had been stable and the operations had gained positively from higher rand prices for export coal due to a weaker rand. JCI hiked its gold profits from 185 million rand in the previous period to 264 million rand. Nairn said tighter trading conditions and low world ferrochrome prices had stunted performance of its chrome division Consolidated Metallurgical Industries and chrome earnings dropped from 50 million rand to 14 million rand. Nairn said JCI remained committed to its strategic objective of focus and growth with 37 million rand spent over the six month period on exploration and new business developments. He said a further 52 million rand had been invested on new projects outside the country. "The company remains committed to its strategic objective of focus and operational growth. Exploration activities are currently being conducted on 25 projects in seven countries for a variety of commodities,' Nairn added. He said another positive development was the selling of Anglo American Corp of South Africa's 34.9 stake in JCI to the black empowerement consortium African Mining Group (AMG), headed by Mzi Khumalo, for 2.9 billion rand. AMG has until May 2, to raise enough cash to close the deal. "The deal is viewed by all of us at JCI Ltd as an extremely positive one," Nairn said "It is vital that South African employees, mine employees in particular be encouraged to participate actively in the processes and the running of our business and that they are given assistance to take on the responsibility of the newly established democracy which has empowered them. "We believe that the expertise of our new owners will play a major role in facilitating...and focusing further our operations and (will) enhance growth and efficiencies," he added. The AMG deal will give black business a significant stake in the South African mining industry for the first time. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003
MCAT	Singapore gas oil swaps rebounded slightly from a midday intraday low, late Tuesday afternoon in active trade as the market looked to the west for support, market sources said. January gas oil was traded down to a low of $31.95 a barrel early afternoon before it picked up to last trade at $32.20, one broker said. The market traded to a day's high of $32.65 this morning, he said. January swaps was last quoted at $32.15/$32.30, about 30 cents higher than Monday's late quotes of $31.85/$32.00.   There was little change in the jet/gas oil spread with January talked at $1.20/$1.40 per barrel. January naphtha was quoted up in thin trade, notionally quoted at $24.00/$24.40 per barrel, up from Monday's offer price of $23.90. Fuel oil edged up slightly on rumours of a January trade at around $117.75 per tonne. January fuel oil was last quoted at $121.00/$122.50 per tonne. "Asia is struggling to keep up with the west where prices have risen sharply," one trader said. Demand from Asia is expected to taper off once the market covers its January requirements as most would be away for the Lunar New Year holidays in February, he said. January gas oil on the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) rose by $8.75 per tonne to close at $222.75 per tonne on Monday. It opened on Tuesday to trade at $224.50, up $1.75 a tonne.

CCAT	The 1,070 megawatt (MW) unit 2 at the San Onofre nuclear power plant in San Clemente, Calif., is expected to synchronize Tuesday with the regional grid sometime between 2000 and 2400 PDT, a spokesman for the plant said. The schedule represents a slight delay from Monday's expectation for the unit to start generating power by late this afternoon. The spokesman said the unit's reactor remains in hot standby and is expected to be at 15 to 20 percent capacity when the grid reconnection takes place. "There will be a couple of hold points on the way (up to full power). We anticipate reaching 100 percent within 24 to 72 hours," he added. Unit 2 was shut in late June for unplanned repairs. Meanwhile, San Onofre's 1,080 MW unit 3 is still scheduled to restart Thursday, although there is a remote chance it could be back up by late Wednesday night, the spokesman said. Unit 3, which has been down since mid-April for refueling, is expected to take longer to ramp up to full power due to testing requirements, he noted. The San Onofre plant is 75 percent owned by Southern California Edison Co, which also operates the plant. ((--Deena Beasley, Los Angeles bureau + 1 213 955 6761))
ECAT	Setting a clear monetary policy objective is crucial for the credibility of Federal Reserve policy, St. Louis Fed President Thomas Melzer said on Thursday. "There has been legislation proposals that would more clearly focus on the goals of monetary policy. I think that is absolutetly essential if we want to maintain the accountability of the central bank on the one hand and maintain its independence on the other hand," Melzer said in a question-and-answer session following his address before the St. Louis Society of Financial Analysts.   Answering a question about whether monetary policy can be independent despite the increased globalization of world markets, Melzer said "the only entity that can create dollars is the U.S. central bank." "To maintain the stable value of our currency over time, that will help support trade and will also help support ... financial flows," Melzer also said. Turning to inflation, Melzer agreed there are anecdotal data showing "there might be some risks on the upside and there has not been any change in the central bank's response to such information."   Melzer declined to comment on current monetary policy developments. The Fed has not moved on short-term interest rates since it last cut by 25 basis points both the federal funds and the discount rates on January 31. "Very clearly, we are focused on inflation in the long run. I don't think there is any disagreement among policy makers that this is really the key long-term goal of policy," Melzer stressed. "We certainly have not taken our eyes off of the inflation ball," the St. Louis Fed president also stressed. -- Isabelle Clary, 212-859-1666

MCAT	CSCE world sugar futures headed lower Wednesday, led by broad losses on the spot October contract. Selling by commission houses kept the market under pressure through most of the session, after an early round of trade buying failed to gather steam. March, May July and October 1997 futures briefly hit fresh life-of-contract highs before retreating. Speculators continued to roll long postions into March ahead of the October contract's expiry at the end of the month. Open interest on the spot month fell by 2,534 lots as of Tuesday's close, to 66,134, while the open position on second-month March climbed by 1,612 lots, to 57,514. "Most of the pressure came from October-March selling by speculators, and there was very good producer selling overhead," noted one trader. October fell 0.09 cent a lb on the day, to 11.96, ranging from 11.94 to 12.12. March eased 0.07 to 1.66, while the remaining months finished even to down 0.04.   The expiry of October options at the end of the week could push futures values toward the well-bid 11.50 strike price, traders said, but solid support was seen from today's settlement at 11.96 through 11.80. Chart resistance stretched from 12.12 to 12.20. Volume on the day reached a solid 20,914 lots. -- Wendy Pollack, New York Commodities Desk +1 212 859 1640
MCAT	U.S. municipal bonds were flat to a bit softer in early trade on Tuesday as the market looked ahead to a surge in new municipal sales as well as the Treasury's three-year auction, which was weighing on prices. "We haven't seen any trades, we might be unchanged to down an eighth of a point in spots," a trader said. Though it still was early in the session, traders said few if any bid wanted lists were being circulated. Municipal bond sales, which this week were expected to rise to nearly $4.1 billion, the second biggest level seen this year, on Tuesday should add up to $1.7 billion in 44 sales, according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group. Negotiated offerings total $1.5 billion in 20 sales, with a $486 million San Antonio, Texas, deal through PaineWebber Inc. topping the list. On the competitive side, 24 sales totaling $194 million were scheduled. A $53 million Hamilton County, Tenn., deal at 1100 EDT was the largest. Maine Municipal Bond Bank's $32 million isse was priced at 5.75 percent in 2017 by PaineWebber. After last week's big rally, traders said that demand remained concentrated in the intermediate sector, as it appeared to represent the best bargains. "There are people who have money to put to work, especially in intermediates," a trader said. Another said buyers have displayed a preference for this part of the yield curve for the past three months or so, as some fear the long-end still is too risky. Treasury bonds eased, partly due to concerns about Wall Street's ability to absorb the $17 billion auction of three-year notes this afternoon, and $12 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday. In debt futures, the June Treasury bonds fell eight ticks to 109-25/32, while the June municipal bond lost six ticks to 114-30/32. This left the MOB spread at plus 165 ticks. A gauge of secondary supply, the Standard and Poor's Corp Blue List slipped to $953 million, a level considered fairly lean. In the secondary market, bids for Delaware River Port Authority of Pennsylvania and New Jersey Revenues of January 1026, which pay a 5-1/2 percent coupon, rose one basis point to 5.75 percent, NET. And Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, JFK International Air Terminal bonds of December 2022, which pay a 5.75 percent coupon, were unchanged, bid at 5.94 percent, NET.

MCAT	Tokyo stocks ended sharply lower on Wednesday with most of the market preoccupied with the debut of Tokyo Disneyland operator Oriental Land Co Ltd, brokers said. Futures-linked sales especially helped drag the benchmark down in the afternoon session, they added. The Nikkei 225 closed 253.74 points or 1.22 percent lower at 20,568.38. Its December futures were down 220 points at 20,570 by the day's end. "Interest in Oriental Land steered the whole market," Yasuo Ueki, Nikko Securities general manager said. "Once trade started to wane, the entire market slowed down."   Oriental Land shares finished at 8,800 yen on the first day of trade, compared to the initial offer price of 8,050 yen. The first trade was done at 8,850 yen and the shares rose briefly to 9,030 yen in the morning before falling back. It was the most heavily traded issue on the first section of the Tokyo bourse on turnover of about 8.46 million shares. "There were hopes that trade in Oriental Land would boom as in the case of Nippon Broadcasting System Inc, which debuted last week, but it didn't, and some investors were disappointed," one foreign broker said.   Brokers said that bouts of weakness in futures sent the benchmark trickling to as low as 20,466.66 late in the day, but they added the weakness was natural after two days of hefty rises. Turnover was 321 million compared to 337 million on Tuesday, with decliners swamping advancers 795 issues to 257 issues, while 179 were unchanged. In other indices, TOPIX was down 18.09 points or 1.17 percent at 1,524.90. The Nikkei 300 fell 3.68 points, or 1.26 percent to 288.70. The second section index was down 6.09 points, or 0.31 percent at 1,931.15.
CCAT	Metro Pacific Corp has reached agreement with Nestle Philippines Inc to dispose of Metro's entire interest in Philippine Cocoa Corp, Metro parent First Pacific Co Ltd said in a statement on Thursday.   The sale will be effective immediately, the statement said. The disposal of Philippine Cocoa will enable Metro Pacific's consumer products division to focus on the further development of its core personal care and packaged water and wine products, First Pacific said. Nestle Philippines, a subsidiary of Nestle SA, manufactures and sells a wide range of confectionery products which will be complemented by the acquisition of major local brands and Philippine Cocoa's local production capacity, it said.   The deal will result in a gain of about 150 million pesos on disposal for Metro Pacific in 1997, a First Pacific spokesman said. He declined to disclose the total value of the deal. Metro Pacific purchased Philippine Cocoa three years ago and held about 98 percent of the company, he said. The unit had turnover of about 700 million pesos in 1996, the spokesman said. Philippine Cocoa since 1995 has been implementing a major rehabilitation programme of its manufacturing facility to increase capacity and improve operational efficiency, the statement said. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843-6352
ECAT	Manitoba Finance Minister Eric Stefanson on Friday projected an annual surplus of C$27 million in his budget for fiscal 1997/98 (April-March). This is the third consecutive annual surplus for the Canadian province. Manitoba will transfer C$100 million from its Fiscal Stabilization Fund to offset federal reductions in transfer payments, Stefanson said. Otherwise, it would post a C$73 million deficit inl 1997/98. Manitoba will pay off C$75 million of its debt to bring it under C$13 billion for the first time in five years.
GCAT	Police in Bogota shot and killed two suspected leftist rebels who were thought to be linked to last week's bomb blast that killed eight policemen, authorities said on Sunday. Diego Antonio Prieto, 44, said to be the No. 4 leader of the National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's second largest guerrilla group, died along with fellow rebel Ana Victoria Ruiz, 24, as they tried to flee police aboard a public bus on Saturday. "We have evidence to suggest these two were linked to (last week's) attack on a police station in which several agents died," Gen. Ismael Trujillo told the respected El Espectador newspaper. Eight policemen were killed in an explosion on Tuesday as they searched for contraband goods in the back of a truck in the parking lot of a police station in Bogota's southwest suburb of Fontibon. The vehicle was taken to the station for inspection after it was abandoned in Fontibon's main square. Six people have so far been arrested in connection with the blast.
CCAT	Procter & Gamble Co said on Thursday its wholly owned Thai unit will raise its sales revenue by 14 percent during the year ending June 30 to about 5.7 billion baht ($219 million). Wilfried van Assche, managing director of Procter and Gamble Manufacturing (Thailand) Ltd, said: "This exceptional result means in 10 years, Procter Gamble has grown 28-fold with eight (product) brands, many of which have attained leadership positions in highly competitive categories." He told reporters P & G consumer goods produced by the Thai unit are marketed in Thailand and exported to over 10 countries. -- Bangkok newsroom (662)-6520642
CCAT	CompuServe Corp said Tuesday it anticipates a second-quarter loss of about $0.10-$0.15 a share due to new product introductions. "Incremental costs associated with the introduction of CompuServe 3.0 and the release of 'WOW! teens view' are anticipated to result in a quarter-quarter loss of approximately $0.10-$0.15 a share," Bob Massey, president and chief executive officer, said in the company's first-quarter report. It posted a first-quarter loss of $0.19 a share before non-recurring charges (Corrects to add "before non-recurring charges.") But the on-line service unveiled cost cuts and other measures and said it expects the second half to improve.  The company said, as forecast earlier, that a decline in subscriber growth, investments in its WOW! service for novice users and infrastructure improvements hurt the first quarter. Subscribers declined from the previous quarter as cancellations outpaced new subscribers, it said. Cost cutting measures include the pending sale of its corporate computer software group of SPRY, Inc. It will also consolidate U.S. staff functions and offices, restructure some third-party customer service agreements and write off software costs for some systems no longer in use, it said. The moves are designed to save $20 million in the rest of the current April-ending year and $30 million on an annualized basis. Massey said most of the 150 job cuts have taken place. That amounts to about four percent of the workforce. Massey said CompuServe is well positioned for substantial gains in the weeks and years ahead. International growth and additional revenue sources such as advertising, interchange and transaction fees should also contribute, CompuServe said. "Coupled with new product releases and aggressive marketing campaigns, we expect the third and fourth quarters to improve with subscribers topping the seven million mark including our Japanese licensee service, NiftyServe," he said. --Cleveland Newsdesk 216-579-0077
GCAT	China on Friday opposed growing calls for a total ban on anti-personnel landmines, saying they were an effective means of self-defence. "To many countries, especially those that have a long land border, landmines remain an effective weapon of self-defence," ambassador Sha Zukang said. Addressing the General Assembly's disarmament and international security committee, he said all states were entitled under the U.N. Charter to use legitimate military means to protect their security. "The Chinese people have not forgotten how landmines, during the eight long years of war against the invasion of Japanese fascists, raised havoc among the invaders, thus playing an important role in China's triumph in the war," said Sha, China's envoy for disarmament affairs. "A film depicting that part of history entitled 'Landmine Warfare' is very popular in China and is loved by all the Chinese people." He said China had always taken seriously the humanitarian concerns raised by landmines. They supported efforts by the international community aimed at preventing the killing and maiming of innocent civilians and agreed that reasonable and appropriate restrictions should be applied, particularly on the use of anti-personnel mines. "The proposal to ban all anti-personnel landmines, an assumption based on an over-exaggeration of humanitarian concerns and the total disregard of the specific situations of other countries and the military utility of landmines, is unjustifed. We cannot agree with it," he said.
MCAT	CBOT wheat futures closed lower on a collapse in soybean futures plus bearishness stemming from USDA's projection for 1996-97 U.S. wheat carryover at 465 million bushels, traders said. Analysts had expected the government to place the carryover at roughly 450 million bushels. "For quite awhile wheat and corn were supported by old crop beans and when beans broke it hit wheat and corn," said Joel Karlin, senior grains Analyst for Chicag-based Everen Securities. USDA's wheat production estimates also was bearish. USDA estimated 1997 U.S. wheat production at 2.261 billion bushels which was about in line with trade expectations and did little to generate demand for futures. "USDA is saying with any normal weather the supply/demand situation is going to be a lot different than it was the past two years," Karlin said. Record high prices were set roughly a year ago in wheat and corn futures on projections for low carryover of each. Wheat futures closed two to 14-3/4 cents per bushel lower, with May down 12 cents at $3.93 per bushel. New crop July was 14-3/4 cents lower at $3.99.   Traders said there were no surprises in USDA's outlook for U.S. winter wheat production at 1.561 billion bushels. That estimated tally was six percent above last year's output of 1.478 billion. A mid-April freeze cut into hard red winter wheat production prospects but not as much as some in the market had expected. USDA said hard red winter production in 1997 would total 893.927 million bushels, above 762.402 million bushels produced in 1996. Wheat also was hit by USDA's weekly export inspections report. Drier-than-desired wheat conditions in western Kansas underpinned the market and USDA's weekly export inspections report was neutral for wheat futures. USDA Monday said U.S. wheat inspected for export during the week ended May 8 totaled 12.836 million bushels, within the range of expectations for nine million to 14.0 million bushels. USA Trading sold two million bushels of July and Merrill Lynch Futures sold 1.8 million July, traders said. Cargill Inc bought three million bushels of July, traders said. Wheat futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 20,000 contracts, above the 11,995 contracts traded Friday. Options-related selling also hit wheat futures, traders said. FIMAT Futures bought 2,000 July $4.20 puts and sold 2,000 September $4.10 puts at even money to two cents, traders said. FIMAT also bought 2,000 July $4.10 puts and sold 2,000 September $4.00 puts at 1-1/2 to 1-1/4 cents, traders said. Wheat options volume was estimated at 10,000 contracts, above the 7,528 traded Friday. On Monday afternoon after the market closed, USDA said 53 percent of U.S. winter wheat as of Sunday was in good to excellent condition. That was an improvement from 28 percent of wheat in that category the previous week. Also, USDA said 47 percent of winter wheat was in very poor to poor condition, less than 72 percent in that category the previous week which was also an improvement. ((Sam Nelson 312-408-8721))
MCAT	Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 rubber prices were generally stable on Friday but traders were cautious following the government's decision to float the rupiah, traders said. "Traders are generally cautious because we seem to be losing direction. We are still closely monitoring developments in the currency while buyers are expected to put pressure on the price," said one trader in Palembang, South Sumatra. The rupiah fell to a new low of 2,890 against the dollar in early trading on Friday. One foreign bank dealer said an easing of overnight rates to 30 percent from 125 percent prompted some dollar buying, triggering other operators to cut short dollar positions. Some rubber traders said buying interest seemed to be zero. "Buyers seem to have launched their attack on the prices. Buying interest has been zero in the past few days, which is widely interpreted as their tactic to ask for cheaper prices," said one trader. "Many traders just do not have any idea on how much cheaper they can sell rubber," he said. Traders said SIR20 was on offer at 42.20 U.S. cents/lb fob Palembang for October shipment, 42.00 fob Pontianak and Jambi, 42.75 fob Medan, 42.50 fob Surabaya and 42.375 fob Padang. Traders said the current drought had started to have an impact on a number of rubber plantations. "In South Sumatra, for instance, it has not rained for three months, which caused many rivers to dry up," said one trader. "The drought has also affected the flow of latex. Some people are holding the raw material, either because of the drought or because of the uncertainty in the currency," he said. Other traders said transport had become expensive in a number of places because river transport was ruled out in the wake of low water levels. The official Antara news agency reported on Friday the government planned to seed clouds in September and October in order to induce rain. The agency said the rain-making efforts would be carried out in Java and part of Sumatra island, adding that the artificial rain would ease the impact of the current drought, which is expected to affect rice-producing areas. -- Lewa Pardomuan (6221) 384-6364; Fax (6221) 344-8404 -- E-mail: jakarta.newsroom@reuters.com

ECAT	The following are analysts' comments on Portugal's February inflation data, which rose 0.2 percent from January's 0.3-percent gain. Year-on-year February inflation was up 2.9 percent from up 3.3 percent, previously: MARTIN AMARAL NETO, BANCO ESSI: "It's a good number. It's what we expected, and it will favour a fall in short-term rates, both money market rates and Portuguese bond rates. The number underlines the absence of inflationary pressures and the downward trend in inflation. The Bank of Portugal has room to cut rates, but a decision will depend on the progress of non-tradable goods prices."   JOAO MIGUEL LOURENCO, SIEMCA "The inflation number was at the lower end of expectations and is a good result. I think that it makes the government's objective for inflation for 1997 (2.25-2.5 percent) more credible. Although the Bank of Spain cut rates today, I think the Bank of Portugal will adopt a more cautious attitude and will not cut rates soon because of exchange rate instability."   JORGE FERRAZ, INFORMACAO DE MERCADOS FINANCEIROS "It is a good number. I think it makes room for the Bank of Portugal to cut rates. Our rates are higher than Spain's and so with Spain's rate cut today we are further behind. I think it is too early for the government to revise its 1997 inflation target.

The market value of the more than 5,530 companies listed on Nasdaq stood at $1.68 trillion, up 10.8 percent from the end of 1996, it added.
ECAT	Brazil expects to launch its upcoming 150-200 million 10-year sterling Eurobond next week, and not this week as some market players had anticipated, the Central Bank said. A spokesman said International Affairs Director Gustavo Franco would mull the fallout from Thursday's 25 basis point rise to 6.75 percent in the official British interest rate and decide next Monday when to issue the sterling bond. "Next Monday he (Franco) will decide. This week it won't happen," the spokesman said.   He said Brazil's Central Bank had been given the "green light" from lawyers to issue the bond despite a reported court order in Italy to seize Brazilian assets. An Italian court ruled on June 19 in favor of a group of companies who are suing the Brazilian government for failing to pay up after instructing them to buy coffee in a bungled bid to rig international prices in 1986. The Central Bank said proceeds from a June 2 Italian lire Eurobond, which had reportedly been subject to the court order, had made it into the country without interference and lawyers had determined the sterling issue would not be affected. "We've been given the green light by our lawyers. There is no possibility of the money being seized," the spokesman said. ((-- Michael Christie, Brasilia newsroom 55-61-3141193))

BERLINGSKE TIDENDE --- Denmark's second largest airport Billund is now the regional airport in western Denmark operating most flights to foreign destinations and thus participating fully in the ever escalating competition between airports in Europe, according to a report on their future by investment bank Salomon Brothers. POLITIKEN --- Danish toy group Lego's entertainment park, Legoland, in Windsor, west London reached its target of 1.4 million visitors in its first 1996 summer season. Next spring construction of a new Legoland begins in San Diego, California, for opening in 1999. JYLLANDS POSTEN --- Denmark has demanded a prompt reply from Turkey on allegations against Turkish police of torturing a Danish citizen of Kurdish extraction, who was jailed last summer during a family visit to Ankara after being accused of being a member of the Kurdish PKK separatist organisation. The Turkish ambassador to Denmark dismisses the allegations as anti-Turkish propaganda. --- Some 50 harbours run by Danish local authorities are demanding law reforms to allow them to operate as private limited companies, the aim being to increase competitiveness and attract investment.

CCAT	U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer plans to ask the Federal Trade Commission to reject the proposed merger of Shell Oil Co and Texaco Inc's western U.S. refining and marketing operations, a spokesman for Boxer said Tuesday. "She is urging them to oppose the pending merger," the spokesman said, describing a letter Boxer was drafting to send to the FTC. The California Democrat, backed by consumer groups, plans to release the letter at a press conference Thursday. The FTC is in the midst of reviewing the proposal, which five consumer groups led by Citizen Action last month urged the agency to reject saying it would stifle competition on the West Coast, which already has a limited number of refiners and marketers. The two giants say they have to merge in order to stay competitive in a business that has tight margins and high capital costs.
CCAT	ECC International Corp said Wednesday that it has amended its stockholder rights agreement by increasing the threshold of company shares that must be under beneficial ownership before preferred stock repurchase rights take effect. The company said it increased the level to 30 percent from 22.5 percent in response to a request from a major shareholder that it terminate the plan. The company said that it was in the best interests of shareholders to increase the trigger level, effective immediately, in the event the company were confronted with a coercive or unfair takeover. Shareholders voted in December to seek a sale of the company. ECC International design and makes simulators for the U.S. Department of Defense and the armed forces in 25 countries.
GCAT	European Union justice ministers will discuss tougher drugs laws in Dublin on Thursday, close to a spot where angry citizens took the law into their own hands and beat to death a suspected drug pusher with baseball bats. Over a two-day informal meeting in Dublin Castle, they will debate how to satisfy a general outcry across the EU against the spread of drugs and try to persuade parents, citizen groups and social workers that vigilante justice is unnecessary. The brutal murder in Dublin last May of AIDS sufferer, heroin addict and minor criminal Josey Dwyer illustrated the depth of the problem. A further reminder came in June when contract killers, thought to have been hired by a drugs baron, shot dead the country's premier investigative journalist for knowing too much. Ireland's Justice Minister Nora Owen, whose country is current EU president, said she was pushing for uniform sentencing at the top end of the scale for drugs traffickers and increased cooperation across borders. "I am confident that...as a result of some initiatives I have taken as President of the Council and from proposals being put forward by other countries, that we will make progress in trafficking laws whether it is drugs, children or women," Owen told reporters at a briefing ahead of Thursday's meeting. Owen said Ireland already had tough legislation in place, allowing for life sentencing of drugs traffickers. "I want each minister to commit themselves in their own countries to bring in such legislation, if they have not already got it in place. Basically their laws should contain in them a sentence (for drugs traffickers) that reflects the most serious sentence that they give for crimes," she said. She said such legislation did not conflict with allowing people to smoke cannabis in cafes in countries like the Netherlands. "That is not trafficking," Owen said. She said other ministers had asked for "a great deal of discussion" of man-made drugs being manufactured in European and neighbouring countries such as Poland and Hungary. "Fast and furious we are now becoming producers of drugs ourselves. Man-made drugs are becoming more and more of a problem as they are seen as almost respectable, just like popping a tablet," she said. The advancement of drug profiling can help track down where a drug was made, she said. The European Drugs Unit, based in the Hague, has identified chemical imprints on drugs which reveal their origin. "By doing a chemical analysis on these drugs and profiling the chemicals that go into them, one can say these originated in Holland or Poland or wherever," Owen said. "This may identify regular routes for traffickers and may also lead to blacklisting or controlling of some of the substances which are now being used to make these man-made drugs."
MCAT	Spot bulk electricity prices in the southeastern U.S. Thursday held steady versus Wednesday's level in another thinly traded session. Moderate spot demand in the region continued to mitigate concerns over this week's volatility in the natural gas market, traders said. Swing natural gas prices at Henry Hub, La., finished today in the $3.70 per million British thermal unit area, up 35 percent from a week ago. Relatively pleasant late autumn weather was forecast to remain in Florida and the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC) district Friday. Friday's temperatures in SERC was expected to peak in 50s-60s Fahrenheit and bottom in the 30s-40s, and those in Florida were predicted to peak in the 70s-80s and bottom in the 50s-60s. Among Florida utilities, 12-hour block power for Friday was again discussed in the $27.00-$29.00 a megawat. At the Georgia/Florida border, firm, peak electricity in 16 hour blocks for Friday held at $21.00-$23.00, while firm, off-peak power stayed in the $17.00-$18.00 range. A 518 megawatt gas-fired unit at the Northside generating station in Jacksonville, Fla., was expected to resume operation Monday following a maintenance shutdown that began earlier this month. Spot prices at the northern end of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) territory firmed today amid rising spot prices in northern districts such as the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP) and East Central Area Reliability Coordination Agreement (ECAR).

GCAT	Director, Regional Specialists Unit, RFE/RL Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) chairman Milos Zeman sees the decisive victory of the Labour Party in Great Britain as a sign of things to come not only in other West European countries, such as Germany, but also in the Czech Republic. Zeman's forecast, however, is problematic for a number of reasons -- the chief one being that Zeman is no Tony Blair. In fact, the CSSD chairman resembles much more Neil Kinnock, whose politicial style, one can argue, was among the causes of Labour's past electoral failures. The Czech Republic is a country ripe for political change. The right-of-centre government was for months unable to address mounting economic problems and proliferating cases of fraud in the banking sector and investment funds. It waited until mid-April to come up with a package of measures aimed at correcting the negative developments. But it failed to identify and replace government members responsible for troubled sectors. As a result, the package is not likely to generate fresh political dynamism. Opinion polls show that only about one quarter of Czechs are satisfied with the political process in the country; and only some 45 percent trust the government. Observers may be right when they describe the coalition government as tired and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus himself as exhausted and devoid of new ideas. It would seem that under such circumstances Zeman's CSSD is a natural replacement for Klaus's coalition. And indeed, had Zeman followed the example of Tony Blair, he could now be close to assuming power. But Zeman's combative style, a lack of tolerance for opponents within his party, and attempts to court voters of extremist parties have made him and his party difficult to accept for many Czech voters. Just as happened in Britain, the  political battle in the Czech Republic between the CSSD and the coalition should focus on centrist voters. But, instead of trying to appeal to such voters with a moderate approach and centre-left policies, Zeman has scared many of them away with his radicalism. As a result, many Czech voters feel they currently do not have an alternative. They find it difficult to continue actively supporting the coalition parties but, at the same time, cannot in clear conscience support the CSSD. In other words, Zeman is too unpredictable. His virulent attacks on the ruling coalition are rarely accompanied by offering alternative economic and political ideas. Moreover, the CSSD's policies make it difficult for Josef Lux's Christian Democratic Union (KDU-CSL) -- a member of Klaus's coalition -- to accept the CSSD as a potential ally. Without the KDU-CSL, however, Zeman cannot hope to form a government. Zeman anticipates a crisis of major proportions -- one that would radicalise the centrist voters to the point where even a more radical CSSD would become acceptable to them. However, no such crisis seems to be in the offing. The Czech economy is, despite all its problems, still doing fairly well. In a comparative perspective, it still easily outperforms most other East European economies. The coalition's main problem is not a real (or potential) economic crisis. Rather, its main problem is that it procrastinated for too long with introducing corrective measures to its otherwise successful reforms as well as with putting more emphasis on the rule of law. It is likely that austerity measures that are part of the government's package will further alienate some social groups. And it is likely that the already besieged government will come under pressure from such groups. Its ability to withstand such pressure is relatively low. However, in order to be able to take over governing, the CSSD would need to trigger early elections in which it would win as decisively as Tony Blair's Labour Party in Britain. Alternativley, it would need a modest victory accompanied by the willingness of the KDU-CSL to become the CSSD's coalition partner. What Zeman refuses to see is that centrist voters in Britain embraced Labour partly because they had lost their fear that Labour would start a process of radical changes. Czech voters do not have the same confidence in Zeman's CSSD, despite the fact that, just as British voters did before their elections, more and more people want a change. When President Vaclav Havel recently said the public was in a "foul mood," he was, as usual, right. One reason for such a state of affairs is that most of those Czech voters who describe themselves as centrist (now the largest group of voters) have almost no alternatives. They realise that economic and political reforms started seven years ago need corrections. And they no longer trust the ruling coalition. But Zeman's radical rhetoric makes them feel that the CSSD may want more than just "corrections." True, the examples of socialist parties that took over governing in Poland and Hungary show that radical preelection rhetoric often differs from such parties' concrete policies after the elections. However, the critical mass of Czech voters seem to believe that Zeman, unlike Aleksandr Kwasniewski or Gyula Horn, may be as radical and unpredictable when in power as he is now.

CCAT	Buckeye Management Co, general partner of Buckeye Partners LP, set a regular quarterly partnership cash distribution of $.75 per unit and said it would boost that to $0.85 per unit after it restructured its employee stock ownership plan.   The board announced plans to restructure the General Partner's employee stock ownership plan in December. This would reduce the cost of maintaining the employee stock ownership plan, it said. After implementing the restructured plan, Buckeye said it would increase its quarterly cash distribution payment to $0.85 per unit. The regular $0.75 per unit distribution was payable February 28 (corrects from February 23) to unitholders of record on February 21, it said. ((New York newsdesk 212-859-1610))
ECAT	The French government is considering easing a special tax on the wealthy so that rich people do not flee the country, Urban Affairs and Integration Minister Eric Raoult said on Sunday. "We would not want the hen that lays a golden egg to leave...allowing capital to escape, little by little, out of the country," Raoult said in an interview on French Radio J. He acknowledged that the so-called "solidarity tax on great wealth" was popular with the public but said he believed the right balance could be found to keep the public satisfied while encouraging the wealthy to remain on French soil. Parliament is in the midst of weighing the 1997 state budget but has so far left the wealth tax unchanged. Conservative President Jacques Chirac said earlier this year that the tax should be eased, but the opposition Socialists promptly attacked the idea as evidence of Chirac's "solidarity with the rich". The tax will this year bring in an estimated 8.8 billion francs ($1.7 billion) from some 170,000 taxpayers. The miniumum rate is 0.5 percent of total assets of 4.6 million francs, rising to a maximum of 1.5 percent for holdings above 45.5 million francs. ($1=5.088 French Franc)
ECAT	Brazil's public sector accounts are showing an improvement with the consolidated public sector operational deficit falling to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first two months of 1997, a newspaper said. Gazeta Mercantil said this figure compared with a deficit of 3.85-percent of GDP in December last year. Planning Minister Antonio Kandir said the fall in the operational public sector deficit, which includes interest payments on debt, was largely the result of lower interest rates, according to Gazeta Mercantil. However, the primary public sector deficit, which excludes debt interest payments, also improved, with the first two months of 1997 showing a surplus of 0.32 percent of GDP in comparison with a deficit of 0.07 percent of GDP in December, Gazeta said. Kandir said even though the public sector accounts were showing an improvement it was too early to see this performance as an "unmistakable trend", Gazeta said.

ECAT	Romania's central bank governor Mugur Isarescu said the 1997 external debt limit would be close to this year's $3.0 billion, the independent Mediafax news agency said on Thursday. Isarescu told Mediafax his bank would draw medium- and long-term loans worth up to $1.5 billion from international markets. The rest will be raised by the Finance Ministry. Central bank officials were unavailable for comment. With external debt servicing estimated at some $1.2 billion in 1997, the central bank will have to maintain the foreign exchange reserve levels it managed to build up this year, when it drew $1.4 billion from the international markets. Latest data showed the central bank's foreign exchange reserves were $1.0 billion in October. The figure does not include some 87 tonnes of gold in reserves. Virtually absent from world capital markets since the 1980s, Romania resumed activity in 1995 with syndicated loans, followed by its first Samurai and Eurobond issues this year. It got its first rating from major agencies -- a BB plus from Japan Credit Rating Agency, BB-minus by Standard and Poors and Britain's IBCA and BA-three by Moody's Investors Service. Romania's medium- and long-term external debt stood at $6.255 billion at end-September, when short-term liabilities were $728.5 million. Some 43 percent of end-September medium- and long-term debt comes from international institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. -- Mirela Eremia, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264
GCAT	Sixteen Greeks were charged on Monday with gambling and animal protection violations after Athens television channels showed gruesome scenes of dog-fights in northern Greece. A public prosecutor pressed the charges after television showed the dog-fights -- two bloody animals biting each other's necks and snouts until one dropped dead -- in their main news programme. The video caused an uproar among viewers and the channels received thousands of protest calls. "It is an unacceptable act which embarasses the country internationally," main conservative opposition leader Miltiades Evert, told reporters. Police said three or four dog-fights were organised in the northern Veria area in the last month with bets ranging from $20 to $300.
CCAT	South African fuels and chemicals group Sasol Ltd said on Tuesday it had clinched a strategic alliance with Dow Chemical Co Inc of the U.S. to supply it with comonomer into the next century.   Under the first phase of the progamme, which will commence immediately, Sasol will construct a 50,000 tonnes-a-year plant at a cost of $50 million at its Secunda chemicals complex east of Johannesburg. Production is scheduled to start up in the first quarter of 1999.   Sasol said it had concluded a long-term supply agreement with Dow for the entire output of the chemical building block from this first production unit. "This agreement forms the beginning of a strategic alliance between Dow and Sasol for the supply of comononer into the next millenium," Sasol said in a statement. Plans are also underway to build a second 50,000-tonne plant, scheduled for start-up in 2001. Dow will use the production to ensure a long-term supply of comonomer as it grows its polymer business worldwide. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003
MCAT	Croatian stocks took a further dip in light trade on Thursday, and analysts said they could see no end to the bearish period, as the big buyers were staying away from the market. "Foreign investors were scared away by latest political developments, so they backed out," said Igor Kos of Taurus brokerage. Croatia has been shaken by a wave of strikes, and last week its capital saw the biggest popular protest in years. Kos predicted further losses for all stocks except for the fully-listed Zagrebacka Banka. Drugs firm Pliva will fluctuate around its current price, he said. All seven traded issues fell. Volume was more than doubled at 4,938 units, turnover sligtly higher at 1.6 million kuna. Biggest decliner, Zagrebacka Banka E-series preference stock, plunged 70 kuna to 360 with 60 shares sold. Zagrebacka Banka lost 10 kuna to 990 on volume of 514 units. Another fully listed issue, Pliva, fell 199 kuna to 12,801, selling only two shares. Most actively traded, food processor Podravka, closed at 195 kuna, down five, on volume of 3,995 units. Confectioner Kras edged down 30 kuna to 420, with 255 units sold. Traders said the stock reached the perceived bottom, and could post further losses only on smaller volumes. Hotelier Jadranturist inched down five kuna to 265, trading 25 shares. Another hotel stock Laguna Porec, down 20 kuna to 1,030, sold 147 shares. ($1 = 5.4270 kuna)
CCAT	French state-owned electricity utility EDF and GEC Alsthom said on Monday they had signed a deal to build and operate the first Chinese power station entirely financed by foreign investment. The total value of the project exceeded three billion francs ($589.9 million), said Electricite de France and GEC Alsthom, which formed a consortium to carry out the project. "This is China's first BOT -- build, operate and transfer -- project and will be entirely financed by foriegn capital," the companies said in a statement. EDF will hold 60 percent of the company set up for the project while GEC Alsthom will hold 40 percent. EDF chairman Edmond Alphandery called Laibin B "an innovative project which will serve as a reference for foreign investment in power stations in China". The agreement for the finance, construction and operation of the 2x350 megawatt Laibin "B" coal-fired power station was signed with authorities of the province of Guangxi in Beijing on Monday. The consortium will finance and build the power station. After completion in 1999, it will operate the station commercially for 15 years, receiving revenues from the sale of power. The station will then be transferred to the government. China is the largest market in the world for electricity production and its needs are growing at the rate of eight percent a year, the companies said. GEC Alsthom, a joint venture between General Electric Plc of Britain and Alcatel Alsthom of France, will be the consortium leader for construction of the plant and will supply the turbine generators, boilers and electrical equipment. Laibin represents EDF's first involvement in a major thermal power generation project and will also constitute its first investment in Asia. ($ = 5.086 French Francs)
ECAT	India's fiscal deficit in the six months of 1996/97 (April-March) totalled 309.05 billion rupees against a target of 622.66 billion for the entire financial year, the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday. "As per the provisional accounts, the fiscal deficit in the first six months up to September 1996 was 309.05 billion rupees which works out to 49.6 percent of the budget estimate figure of 622.66 billion for the year 1996/97," it said in a written reply to a question in the upper house of the parliament. The government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the current fiscal year ending next March 31. In 1995/96 the deficit stood at 5.9 percent of GDP. "Government would endeavour to contain fiscal deficit by maximising revenue and controlling expenditure," the statement said. --New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024
MCAT	Canadian bonds opened weaker in active trade on Wednesday, softening in tandem with weaker U.S. treasuries on the release of stronger than expected U.S. gross domestic product data, analysts said. "The (U.S.) GDP came in way higher than expectations, way higher than the highest expectations, so naturally we're selling off," said Jim Webber, director of fixed-income research with TD Securities Inc. Canada's 30-year benchmark fell C$0.33 to C$108.95 to yield 7.232 percent. The U.S. 30-year bond fell 12/32 to yield 7.02 percent.   The spread between the two bonds narrowed to 21 basis points from 23 basis points at the close of trading on Tuesday. Canadian and U.S. fixed-income markets weakened after the U.S. report, which showed that GDP grew at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the first quarter. A Reuters survey of economists had expected, on average, a 4.1 percent rise in the first quarter. In Canada, an economic report showed Canada's monthly GDP data rose 0.5 percent in February, in line with expectations. The Canadian report had little impact on markets.   The U.S. report dominated markets as it increased speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve would hike interest rates in the near future. On Tuesday, Canadian bonds posted their biggest one-day gains since the Quebec referendum of 1995, as weaker than expected U.S. economic data spurred hopes that U.S. rates would not rise. "It's not like we're pricing in a whole bunch of Fed hikes again based on having been wrong yesterday. It's just that things maybe got a little bit too bullish yesterday and at least some of that is being given back," said TD's Webber.   Canada's 10-year benchmark bonds fell C$0.33 to C$101.95 to yield 6.719 percent. The U.S. bond fell 9/32 to yield 6.80 percent. The negative spread between the bonds was eight basis points, unchanged from Tuesday's close. The three-month cash T-bill yielded 3.18 percent against its U.S. equivalent, which yielded 5.27 percent.

MCAT	U.S. West Coast crudes rose with benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI), but discounts for Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude were unchanged as players failed to strike any new deals. October WTI got a boost from reports of a large draw in U.S. crude oil stocks, which fell 3.3 million nationwide last week, a trade group reported. October WTI was pegged $24.10/24.20 a barrel. But October deliveries of ANS remained at $2.15 a barrel off WTI, with buyers holding out because of a supply glut and too many sellers.   A number of refinery outages, both planned and unplanned, were reported by traders. A gasoline-making unit at Chevron's El Segundo plant was due to come off line at the end of September, and coker and crude units at Texaco's Los Angeles refinery were due down this week, traders said. Traders said Mobil's plant at Torrance, California, was planning a crude unit outage in January. Planned maintenance on Unocal's crude unit was also scheduled for the same month. Meanwhile, Arco's Carson plant was reportedly buying distillates during the past week because of coker problems.   The shut coker could back up crude into the market, traders said. Powerine refinery in Santa Fe Springs, California, was beginning the process of starting up but no date was set for production of refined products, a company official said. The official denied an earlier report that the refinery would make products by September 21. The 47,000 barrel-per-day refinery has the capacity to make 20,000 of CARB gasoline and 10,000 bpd of CARB diesel. Kern River was quoted at discounts of around 35/25 cents to posted pricings at $15.75 a barrel. But one trader heard unconfirmed deals at parity to postings. Values for Wilmington stood at $17.00/17.20 a barrel.
MCAT	U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Monday were seen steady to $0.50 per cwt lower, pressured by weak pork demand, livestock dealers said. Top prices for Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hogs at the plant could range $49.00 to $49.50 and Illinois top hog prices at the plant could range 48.50 to $49.00, they said. Indiana/Ohio top prices for hogs at the plant could range $48.50 to $49.00, the dealers said. Hog slaughter for the week was estimated at 1.695 million head, compared with 1.705 million a week ago and 1.808 million a year ago, USDA said.   Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota top hog prices at the plant Friday were quoted at $50.00, down $3.00 from the same period a week ago, USDA statistics showed. Hog cutout prices for the week also were in a slump. The gross cutout value of No.2 hog carcass weighing 175 lbs Thursday was pegged at $66.90, down $3.26 from last Friday. Lighter-than-expected marketings Thursday were tied to ideas producers were resisting lower prices by holding some hogs back, dealers said. Interior Iowa/southern Minnesota hog receipts Thursday totalled 97,000 head, below the estimate of 100,000, USDA said. Friday's estimate was 95,000 head. ((Bob Janis 312-983-7347))
ECAT	Israeli and Turkish businessmen will meet in Istanbul next month to examine how the Jewish state can penetrate markets in central Asia's Islamic republics, Israel's Export Institute said on Sunday. Israel has sought to expand economic ties with Kazahkstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. "Turkey and Turkish companies can...act as an excellent bridge for Israeli economic activity in that part of the world," the institute said in a statement. "This is mainly because Turkish companies have close and established ties in these countries...and a vast awareness of Israel's ability in fields of industry and technology which are in demand there," it said. A spokesman said the conference would take place on December 10 and 11. Israel has had strong economic ties with Turkey despite protests from some Arab states. The two countries have announced a bilateral free-trade agreement, which still needs parliamentary approval. There is also military cooperation between the two. - Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211

ECAT	The Indicative Planning Council (IPC) for the Housing Industry, the Australian government's housing forecaster, on Tuesday revised up its forecast housing starts for 1996/97 to 127,000 from 124,000. The council also projected a further rise to 142,000 housing starts in the year to June 30, 1998, its first forecast for that year.   "The decline in dwelling construction activity has now slowed considerably from the rapid fall in 1995 and forward indicators suggest that a recovery is likely by the December quarter, 1996," the council said in a statement. "The upturn is expected to be relatively softer than previous upturns in the housing cycle, constrained by some remaining dwelling oversupply." The council includes representatives from industry bodies and national, state and local governments.   The council also revised its estimate for housing starts in 1995/96 to 124,550, from 123,600 in its previous outlook in July. "Underlying requirements for dwellings are estimated to average 138,000 per year up to 1999/2000," it said. "These estimates may be exceeded if recent increases in net overseas migration to Australia are sustained." -- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730

Rockwell produces industrial automation systems, semiconductors, avionics and communication equipment.
CCAT	BESI Semiconductor Industries NV said on Tuesday it expected fourth quarter turnover and profits to be at the level of the third quarter of this year. "As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, net sales and net income are expected to approximate the levels reported in the 1996 third quarter," the firm said. But, based upon current backlog and order rates, both net sales and net income for the first quarter of 1997 are expected to be substantially below the 1996 fourth quarter indications, it added.   The firm said the decline in new orders and backlog for the third quarter of 1996 was the result of continued reductions in purchases of new semiconductor equipment by BE Semiconductor's principal customers. "Although we cannot predict when new order rates will stabilise or improve in relation to current levels, we can report that new systems order activity has increased in the month of October," the firm said. "Such rates are tied primarily to the performance of the overall semiconductor industry and the specific purchasing patterns and capacity needs of its customers," it said.   Earlier, the firm said it had posted Q3 profit of 6.7 million guilders versus a loss of 7.3 million guilders in the third quarter of 1995. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000 fax +31 20 504 5040

MCAT	Mexican stocks reversed mid-session gains after profit-taking on Wednesday to close down 6.29 points or 0.19 percent at 3,302.98 points. "You could tell dealers wanted to take profits when stocks were up, as many stocks prices were high," one trader said. Analysts cited caution among dealers ahead of U.S. economic data due on Thursday "Here they were more concerned than in the U.S. over producer price figures," an analyst said. "Even gains on the Dow Jones didn't convice them nothing bad will happen." Volume was lackluster at 71.7 million shares traded. Some dealers said market sentiment was affected by expectations of a sharp rebound in primary Cetes, or Treasury bill, rates next week after Tuesday's auction results were lower than expected. A total of 106 stocks were traded, and gainers outnumbered losers 45 to 36. Sidek L series headed the percentage leaders with a gain of 50 percent to three pesos (40 cents) after trading for the first time since August 28. "What happened with Sidek is that it had been revalued in the U.S. but had not traded here. It's just catching up with the market," an analyst said. Financial group Invermexico grabbed attention as all four of its share series gained sharply. The LCP series closed 11 percent up at 1.11 pesos (15 cents) Analysts said Invermexico was boosted by rumours of a possible association with a foreign bank. Plus, it had lagged behind the market as its shares are not frequently traded. Beverage company Emvasa B series led the percentage losers after a fall of 5.17 percent to 5.50 pesos (73 cents), but at a relatively low volume of 26,000 shares traded. The day's second-greatest fall was chalked up by steelmaker Hylsamex's BCP series, which closed 3.83 percent down at 30.10 pesos on 582,000 shares traded.

MCAT	U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets early Monday were quiet, with no reported trades or bids following last week's sales, which exhibited some price strength late in the week, feedlot sources said. Owners were pricing cattle at $65.00 per cwt. Packer bids were expected to surface at $62.00, steady with late trade last week. The late sales revived prices from a low on Wednesday of $61.00-$61.50 to end the week at the same level they started, sources noted. Strong packer demand and sharply higher CME live cattle futures lent support late last week, they said.   "I think this is going to be a sit and wait day," one Panhandle feedlot manager said. Several feedlot operators said owners were optimistic that fed cattle prices this week would be steady to firm following last week's sales, which kept most feedlots current. Perceptions that cattle supplies were near a summer peak and would start declining as early as next week also generated outlooks for firm prices, they said. However, price optimism was being tempered by uncertainty over the direction of beef prices this week. Beef movement last week was active but at lower prices, some sources noted.

CCAT	The listing committee of the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) on Friday accepted the application of Czech chemicals, arms and trading conglomerate Chemapol Group a.s. for listing on its parallel market, a PSE official said. Chemapol, which is a huge holding company but has been closely-held, has not been publicly traded on any of the PSE's three markets.   "Chemapol Group worked out and submitted (an application) to the listing committee and was approved for listing on the parallel market," the committee's Pavla Vodstrcilova told Reuters. The company still has to fulfill several formal conditions before it is listed, including publishing an announcement of the listing and paying a fee to the bourse. Chemapol shares have so far been traded in negligible amounts on the over-the-counter market, the RM-System. Companies listed on the main and parallel markets of the PSE are required to publish quarterly results.   Chemapol's owners, which include large Czech banks, refineries and the management, approved a rights issue last month of between 500 milion and 1.64 billion crowns to expand the group's current basic capital of 1.68 billion. The fast-growing conglomerate, which controlled, at last count in August, 67 chemical, industrial, trading and media companies, also plans a minimum 600 million crown Global Depositary Receipts issue next year. Chemapol has grown from mostly oil trading company -- a business it was partially pushed out of by local refineries -- to control an estimated 20 billion crowns in equity throughout its vast holdings.  The group reported consolidated unaudited net profit for the first half of this year of 290 million crowns on sales of 29 billion crowns. It posted audited net profit of 62.5 million crowns in 1995 on the sales of over 40 billion. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003

ECAT	Renato Ruggiero, the Director- General of the World Trade Organization, on Wednesday praised the progress of the Mercosur customs union in its drive to expand trade liberalization in Latin America. "Once you create a successful process like Mercosur you will inevitably see that this will be the core of the process of a Latin American regional process," Ruggiero told Reuters in an interview at the half-yearly meeting of Mercosur presidents held in Asuncion.   Mercosur was established by Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay in 1991. Bolivia and Chile have free trade agreements with the group and talks are in the offing for deals with the Andean countries of Ecuador, Peru and Venezuala in addition to Mexico. The head of the world trade body welcomed prospects of the expansion of Mercosur adding that at "a certain moment I see it connecting itself with the NAFTA (the free trade area grouping the United State, Canada and Mexico) program into an American Free Trade Area (AFTA)."   The heads of state of 34 countries across the Americas agreed in December 1994 to work towards the implementation of AFTA in 2005. Mercosur leaders are expected to firm up their common position on AFTA at this week's meeting. Furthermore, Ruggiero said "it is very important that for the first time the Mercosur has invited the Director-General of the WTO. It shows that this process wants to remain not only compatible with but as a way to strengthening the multilateral trading system."   He said the openness of the Mercosur to world trade rather than sheltered regionalism is what he will underline when he addresses the Mercosur presidents Thursday. "Of course that is what interests me more than anything -- that there is an open regionalism, a regionalism that is ready to have contacts with all the rest of the world." Asked about the introduction by Brazil in March of restrictions on import financing of less than a year which led to a diplomatic spat betwee Brazil and its Mercosur partners, Ruggiero said he hoped a solution can be found.   "I hope this Mercosur meeting will be the occasion to try to settle or at least make progress in the direction of settling this question," he said. Brazil agreed to ease the restrictions for Mercosur imports until July and diplomats at the Asuncion meeting hinted that a solution would be found. "Very frankly the question has not been brought yet to the dispute settlement procedure (of the WTO) - there has been a statement from the United States expressing some concern but no more than that," Ruggiero added.   Rugggiero agreed that so-called U.S. presidential fast-track negotiating powers would be an important addition to U.S. trade policy. Talks on the inclusion of Chile into NAFTA have been held up because President Clinton has not yet got approval from Congress on fast-track powers. "It (fast-track) would be a very important signal of the intention to lead the process of liberalization in the next few years," Ruggiero said.   The WTO head pointed out that integration of Mercosur is going at a rapid pace, even faster than that of Asia's ASEAN trade bloc. "There is even talk of a single currency -- there are a lot ambitions," he said. He added that Mercosur's has been "very succesful," not least because of the impact it has on countries like Paraguay, the poorest of the Mercosur partners. "Take the case of a small country  like Paraguay, which in a certain sense is coming out of a completely different political system and is now moving into democracy and towards opening up its economy. This process is made easier by Paraguay belonging to Mercosur," he said. Most of all, the "Mercosur is very successful and from this point of view the dynamic that it could inject in the liberalisation process of this part of the world is extremely interesting for us in the multilateral system," Ruggiero said.

GCAT	U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday condemned the shooting of seven Israeli schoolchildren by a Jordanian soldier as "inexcusable and tragic," and appealed for calm in the region. But Clinton said there was no evidence that "this terrible incident is related to the tensions in the area over the issues. For all we know this may have been just a deranged person." "There is no reason to believe this was politically motivated," Clinton said before boarding a helicopter at the White House on his way to North Carolina. He was reacting to a Jordanian soldier's killing of seven Israeli schoolgirls who were on an outing to a Israeli-Jordanian border site called "The Island of Peace." "Today along the normally peaceful border between Israel and Jordan, we have seen an inexcusable and tragic act of violence against schoolchildren. I condemn this act in the strongest possible terms," Clinton said. White House officials said recent turmoil in the Middle East peace process may prompt Jordan's King Hussein to cancel a trip to see Clinton at the White House next Tuesday. The king in recent days has warned the peace process may be sliding "towards an abyss of bloodshed brought about by fear and despair." Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met Clinton on Monday and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat the week before. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Clinton on Feb. 13. White House spokesman David Johnson said U.S. officials had seen reports that the king may not be coming and they were trying to verify them. An aide to the king told Israel Radio that Hussein would delay his visit to the United States. Clinton said no one should jump to any conclusions about the shooting "given King Hussein and Jordan's long record of reaching for peace and reconciliation." "We don't have the facts. None of us have any facts other than we know this incident has occurred," Clinton said. "But we have no reason to believe this was politically motivated by any larger group or anything. We just don't know that." He urged leaders in the region to redouble their efforts for peace. "Now the leaders in the region must work hard to calm the situation to do everything in their power to create an atmosphere in which violence is rejected, rather than embraced. We call on the leaders of the people of the region to reject violence, to redouble their efforts toward peace and reconciliation," he said.

GCAT	Turkish security forces backed by air power have launched a large-scale operation against Kurdish rebel positions in the mountainous eastern province of Tunceli, villagers at the scene said on Sunday. They said two air force planes bombed remote ravines on Saturday and Sunday to hit Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas. U.S.-made Cobra helicopter gunships also fired rockets at rebel positions. Soldiers were airlifted by helicopter onto nearby mountain tops to follow up on the the air raids, the villagers told Reuters by telephone. There was no clear word on military or rebel casualties and the army could not confirm details of the push. Anatolian news agency said on Sunday that 17 rebels had been killed in separate clashes in the other parts of the southeast. Security officials say tens of thousands of troops have gathered in Tunceli for a possible spring offensive against the PKK, fighting for Kurdish self-rule. More than 30,000 troops have taken part in similar operations in previous years. But the rebels, aided by rugged terrain, have managed to maintain a fighting capability in the area. More than a 21,000 people have died in the 12-year-old conflict between troops and the rebels.

GCAT	The first shot was fired at high noon on Thursday and a throng of golf fans was off and running -- all hoping for a close look at Tiger Woods's conquest of the U.S. Open. But some five hours later, as Woods's tee shot at the 18th hole bounced into a pond, the crowd had grown quiet and the Masters champion's face was as long as the shadows on the mighty course that had humbled the game's most remarkable young player. The Tiger hunt took in a sea of fans -- many of whom had never seen a golf tournament before -- a rolling mass who spent the day trying to get into position to watch Woods make the kind of shots that won the Masters by a record 12 strokes in April. He was given three ovations before he uncorked his long and gangly body on the first tee. As the ball landed in the fairway, a tall teenager in a Tiger t-shirt shouted: "Nice bounce, Tiger" and the big crowd laughed. Everybody was smiling when his second shot dropped just a few feet from the first pin, but the tone of the day changed quickly when he missed the putt, took a deep breath and looked hard at the hole. The fans were eight and 10 deep around the first green and every subsequent green. They lined the fairways two and three deep as he walked to approach shots, and clapped and cheered as he battled the course to go two under after 10 holes. "It's hard to see him. My strategy is to do a lot of running," said Lenea Phifer, a 27-year-old bank employee from nearby Washington, who was attending her first tournament. "I try to get two holes ahead of him, running back and forth between the greens and the tees," said Ravi Murthy, a 17-year-old high school student from Potomac, Maryland, who was pressed against the rope near the 15th green. "I'm looking for a high five from him," he said, but Woods bogeyed the hole and there were no high fives for anybody. Woods kept flying his approach shots over the greens and missing putts. When he missed a long birdie putt at number three, he lost his temper and punched his putter into the fringe of the green, leaving a Tiger print on the grass. Blair Bennett of Concord, North Carolina, pressed eagerly against the ropes. He'd been waiting for Woods at the 15th tee for 40 minutes because, "I want to see him hit the big doggie." When the whoosh of air that marks the young phenomenon's swinging of the driver had subsided, Bennett drawled his analysis: "Well, my God. He looks more like a cub than a tiger. But he hits the ball like a lion." Those lion-size drives worked brilliantly at the Masters. But on a course where it is said the players have to walk single file down the fairway, this ball was caught in the long rough and Woods made bogey. As the players headed for home, Woods's playing partner, Tom Lehman, was rolling and the crowds had found a new favourite. "I've been following Lehman for nine holes," said Californian Dave Butler. "He seems like a nice guy. He shook my hand once." And on the 17th and 18th holes of Woods's first round in the tournament he hoped would bring his second major title, the cheers were reserved for Lehman. Woods hit a 7-iron into the drink on 18 and after he carded a double-bogey for a four-over 74, he marched quickly toward the clubhouse. When asked what was going through his mind right then, Woods said, just as quickly: "You don't want to know." Up on the grass above the green, however, was 16-year-old Rebecca Herron of Bethesda, Maryland, dressed in a tiger costume, complete with black stripes and fuzzy ears. Asked how she thought Woods had played, she said, "Oh, he's wonderful, he played wonderfully. I know he's going to win the championship."
ECAT	South African GDP continued to show reasonable growth in the third quarter but the figures were once again inflated by a rampant agricultural sector. The Central Statistical Service said gross domestic product (GDP) rose a seasonally adjusted and annualised 3.2 percent in the third quarter from a revised 3.7 percent second quarter rise. But stripping out agriculture -- which was boosted 54.6 percent in the period by a bumper maize crop -- left the core economy growing just 0.5 percent quarter on quarter, down from 1.8 percent in the second quarter. The flat non-agricultural performance reflected a further decline in mining, which fell 7.0 percent, and a 0.5 percent decline in manufacturing. Bond dealers said the headline figure of 3.2 percent was slightly stronger than expected, but market reaction was muted as traders digested the figures. A Reuters poll of economists forecast a third quarter rise of 2.5 percent, with ideas ranging widely from 1.0 to 3.5 percent. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003
ECAT	High interest rates, a weak lev and soaring inflation will continue to batter Bulgaria's economy after the International Monetary Fund again delayed funding due to the slow pace of reform, analysts said on Monday. Sofia's failure to convince the IMF it was making significant steps towards economic reform has meant a one-month delay in a crucial $115 million loan tranche amid concern over whether Bulgaria might default on its foreign debt. "The macreconomic parameters will deteriorate, but there is no short-term danger of defaulting," Krassen Stanchev, head of the Institute on Market Economy, told Reuters. On Saturday, Finance Minister Dimitar Kostov said it was important to receive the IMF funding by year-end as the next big debt payment was due next year. Coupon payments of around $130 million on some $5 billion of Brady Bonds are due at the end of January. Foreign debt payments due until end-1996 amounting to around $150 million and January's coupon on Bradies can be covered by the central bank foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $575 million in August, said a central banker. However World Bank consultant Mariela Nenova said the central bank might dip into the reserves to intervene on the local foreign exchange market to support the weakening lev. The lev, which firmed last week from 231 to the dollar to 212 on Friday after the central bank hiked its central interest rate to a record 300 percent the previous week, eased on Monday to 217.5 on news of the delayed funding. Last week many dealers focused on lev investments to profit from the high yields, but on Monday demand rose for dollars seen as the most reliable investment in the region. Nenova said monthly inflation was seen to remain high at between 15 and 20 percent. Inflation in August stood at 17.1 percent. "It is unlikely that the central bank will be able to reduce the central interest rate under these circumstances," she said. The central bank was under pressure to reduce the rate in a bid to boost investment in the crumbling real economy. "But I suppose the IMF would focus more on actual restructuring changes than macroeconomic targets," said Nenova. Sofia has overshot its macroeconomic frame, already once revised in mid-year. The annual interest rate target of 65 percent and annual inflation of 105 percent were both topped. "There is no reason to receive the tranche now, which if not spent immediately on foreign debt payments, will be siphoned through interventions to support the lev," said Nenova. The government has pledged to close or sell off 64 loss-making state enterprises this month and speed up privatisation by year-end. But legal tangles, lack of experience in closing enterprises which have operated with various levels of success for decades, and the desire to save production considered viable by the government have delayed the closures. In a desperate attempt to raise cash, the Socialist government plans to privatise up to 20 bigger state firms, hoping to raise around $1 billion. The country needs around $350 million by year-end to cover current expenses, which include fuel and grain supplies, said the Kapital business weekly. One quarter of Bulgaria's banks have been placed under special supervision with the aim of seeking their insolvency through the courts. An IMF mission is expected in Sofia by the end of October to evaluate the effect of the stabilisation measures and decide on what macroeconomic assumptions to draft next year's budget frame. It is also expected to complete the first stage of the reform programme review and decide on further funding.

MCAT	The dollar climbed to its highest level in more than 3-1/2 years against the yen Thursday as the Japanese currency took a beating after stock prices tumbled again in Tokyo. The dollar was boosted by strength in stock markets at home, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose for the seventh consecutive session. With most markets in Europe still closed for the Christmas holiday, trading was light, currency dealers said. "We're in holiday mode, it's very thin and there's very little incentive to be involved at this point unless you really have to be," said Paul Park, vice president and dollar-yen trader at Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank. Trading was busy in Tokyo though after Japan's cabinet approved a draft 1997 budget late on Wednesday calling for a tax increase and a delay in a corporate tax cut, worrying investors that the fledgling economic recovery may be derailed. The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares plunged more than 700 points at one point before rebounding to close down 257.83 points at 19,291.58. "The dollar's rise against the yen came on the back of the drop in the Nikkei," said Mellon's Park. "The knee-jerk reaction has just been to buy dollars against yen. It's the easiest money out there right now and I think it will continue to attract investors," he said. The dollar touched 115.08 yen in Tokyo trading, its highest level since April 1993. The dollar stood at 114.95 yen late in New York trading, up from 114.47 late on Tuesday. New York markets were closed for Christmas on Wednesday. Dealers said they expect weakness in Japan's stock market to continue to weigh on the yen, which is hurt by sales of Japanese stocks that tend to decrease demand for yen. Comments from a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official helped cap the dollar's gains against the yen. The official told Reuters that Japan's monetary authorities did not welcome wild currency fluctuations and were keeping a close watch on developments in the foreign exchange market. Dealers interpreted the remarks as meaning that Japanese officials would frown on a further decline in their currency against the dollar. "With dollar/yen reaching new cycle highs it was enough to introduce a little bit of caution into the market," said Bob Lynch, senior currency analyst at MMS International. Dealers said strength in the domestic stock market helped the dollar. But thin post-Christmas trading confined the currency to a tight ranges vs. most major currencies. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.83 points to 6,546.68, about a point shy of the record 6,547.79 set on Nov. 25. The dollar ended at 1.5541 German marks, off slightly from Tuesday's 1.5565 marks. The dollar settled at 1.3450 Swiss francs, little changed from 1.3455 on Tuesday. Elsewhere, the British pound edged higher to $1.6740 from $1.6725 on Tuesday. The dollar fell slightly to Canadian $1.3638 from C$1.3650.

MCAT	The won closed lower against the dollar on Tuesday due to importer settlements and build-ups of dollar positions, dealers said. "Dollar positions are rapidly drying up because of continuing importer deals," said a foreign bank dealer. The won closed at 894.60 against Monday's closing of 893.50. It opened at 894.00 and moved between 893.80 and 894.70. Dealers said dollar buying was limited by fears of the central bank's dollar sales intervention. "The intervention level is believed to be at around the 895.00 level," the foreign bank dealer said.   The won's mid-rate is expected to be pegged at 894.40 on Wednesday, compared with 893.00 today. Dealers said the yen's fall against the dollar also helped the won open weak today. "Market players will continue to watch the yen's movements against the dollar," said a domestic bank dealer said. He said trading would range from 893.50 to 896.50 on Wednesday.

Dealers said the supply of dollars in the market also increased because some banks decided to sell dollars after holding them in expectations of a decline in the reais-dollar mini-band. The Central Bank lowered the mini-band Thursday by 0.09 percent to a range between 1.0670 and 1.0720 reais per dollar. So far this month, the mini-band has fallen 0.33 percent against the dollar compared to an average drop of between 0.57 and 0.61 percent in the past four months. In the interbank floating rate market, the real fell 0.05 percent to end at 1.0716 per greenback. In the parallel market, the real closed unchanged at 1.130 per dollar, traders said.

CCAT	Shares in First South African Foods Ltd dipped on Wednesday as profit-takers moved out of the share after the group's roaring bourse debut on Tuesday, dealers said. "It is just off on some profit-taking after a very stong first day," one dealer said. First Food dropped 15 cents to 340 cents in volumes of more than 430,000 shares. The firm, which had been offered at an issue price of 200 cents, had surged as high as 375 cents on its first day's trading as dealers poured into the stock. The initial share rise had been so marked because the public offer had been limited with the majority of shares being retained by holding firm First South Africa Holdings (FSAH), management or offered to institutions in a private placing. The firm, which invests in niched food manufacturing operations, aims to use the cash raised in the flotation to pursue a number of expansion opportunities. First Food owns four operating companies, namely Piemans Pantry, Astoria Bakery, Seemann's Quality Meat Products and Gull Food.

MCAT	The Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) said on Tuesday that it would raise the margin requirements on its October rubber futures contract by 40,000 yen per trading lot, effective from Wednesday. This would bring the margin fee on the October contract to 102,500 yen, TOCOM said in a statement. The increase is intended to cool overheated trade. The margin fees on the remaining November to February contracts will remain unchanged at 52,500 yen, TOCOM said.
ECAT	Following are economists' reactions to New Zealand's Budget Policy Statement on Tuesday in which Treasurer Winston Peters reaffirmed the government's prudent fiscal stance. PAUL STEWART, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANZ BANK "Winston Peters and the government are clearly signalling a very strong intention to keep within the parameters that they outlined in the (December) coalition agreement, so that's reasonably reassuring.   "But I think it's important not to lose sight of the fact that there is still a fair degree of fiscal slippage built into the profile over the three-year period, so talk about fiscal prudence, I think, has to be kept in the right sort of context. "There may be, if anything, slightly less pressure on monetary policy over the next 12 months as a result of the small reduction in expected spending in that year. But it's very marginal -- two or three hundred million dollars is not a lot in the context of overall government spending.   "But it's at least reassuring that there's been no further slippage, that in the near term the increase in government spending is not greater than previously expected. That would have certainly concerned financial markets."   gone out and permanently worsened the fiscal position by the end of the period over and above what it was in the Coalition Document. "The Reserve Bank's forecasts will change dramatically from the forecasts in December, not as a result of today's document but as a result of the December 10 Coalition Agreement, specifically, the widening of the inflation target to 0-3 percent, the very large increase in spending this year and in 1998 and 1999 and the rise in the minimum wage rate. "We think the combined impact of those three things is going to see the Reserve Bank revise up its forecasts quite a lot."   In December the RB was forecasting zero inflation by the end of 1998. "We suspect the numbers they publish next week will be closer to 1.5 (percent)." Asked about Peters' comment that there was no room for fiscal easing, Plank said: "I'm not sure what he means there, because he has just gone out and eased fiscal policy massively over the next three years.   "I suppose what he meant is that there is no room for fiscal easing over and above the very large fiscal easing we have already done. I hope he doesn't believe he is being fiscally tight." -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746
MCAT	The won closed higher on Thursday as some banks went short on the dollar, and dealers said the market would drift sideways for the time being. They said domestic companies were the major players in the recent won/dollar market, while bank dealers remained cautious as they differed over the future direction. The won ended at 893.70, compared with the close of 893.90 on Wednesday. After opening at 893.50, the won rose to 892.50. But the won fell to 894.20 on fears of a central bank intervention and on looming importer deals at the weekend.   Dealers forecast an expected inflow of foreign funds to invest in the local stock market would depress the dollar. "The dollar will move below the 895.00 won level," said a domestic bank dealer. Dealers said trading volume amounted to $1.18 billion on Thursday. Friday's mid-rate is expected to be pegged at 893.40 from 894.30.
GCAT	Three Georgia police detectives were wounded Saturday in a 15-minute gun battle with a heavily armed man holed up in a rural mobile home northwest of Augusta, authorites said. Shots rang out along state Highway 79 just after 10 a.m. EST, when agents from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation tried to end a standoff that had begun Friday, by lobbing tear gas cannisters into the residence. The gunman, identified as Wayne Miller, fired on police with what appeared to be a shotgun and then tossed out a hand grenade. The grenade did not explode. But three GBI agents were injured in the melee. They were treated at a hospital in nearby Augusta and released. "Gunfire ensued for 10 to 15 minutes. Prior to that, he threw out a hand grenade and that's when law enforcement returned fire," said GBI spokeswoman Pamela Swanson. Local press reports later said the gunman's mother tried to help police talk him out. When Miller failed to respond to the entreaties, GBI agents prepared to send in a remote-controlled robot equipped with a camera to determine his condition and his whereabouts. Miller was described by police as a man in his late 40s who lived alone at the mobile home. The standoff began Friday after state police and Lincoln County sheriff's deputies arrested another man in an undercover drug bust that netted two to three pounds of marijuana. A search of that suspect's home revealed another 30 to 35 pounds of marijuana and evidence which police said could identify Miller as the source of the controlled substance. Miller pulled a gun on GBI agents who went to his home to question him about the drug case and the standoff ensued. Lincolnton is located about 100 miles east of Atlanta.
GCAT	Australian flyhalf David Knox promises a victory lap few will forget if the Wallabies break their Dunedin jinx in Saturday's Tri-Nations test against New Zealand. "If I make it 10 out of 10 I'll make a nude lap around the field," he told reporters. Knox, who has never played in a losing Wallaby team since he began his test career in 1985, admits extending his nine-test run will not be an easy one. New Zealand's All Blacks are strong favourites going into the game, having had a seven-test winning streak so far this year, and have a powerful spell of their own at the Carisbrook ground -- the Wallabies have never scored a win there. "My unbeaten test record's going to be sorely tested. I've been regarded as a good luck charm for the team -- it worked out for us last week -- but you can't take anything for granted at this level," Knox said. All Black coach John Hart acknowledged Knox as vital to the Australian effort and said he had been discussed by the team. "If you don't close him down you're in a big trouble because he is a very, very good player. We'll certainly be looking at putting pressure on him," Hart said. Knox is also hoping for some latitude from French referee Joel Dume, saying: "They (the All Blacks) always fringe on the offside and that makes it very tough for you to play." The All Blacks have a strong hand going into the game, helped by the confirmation during Friday that Knox's counterpart, Carlos Spencer, is fit to play after a minor injury in training on Thursday. New Zealand are poised to win their second Tri-Nations crown if they clean up on Saturday, but coach John Hart has assured that his team will not be complacent going on to the field. "We need to win the game to win the Tri-Nations, so I don't think we lack for motivation -- but nor do the Australians." With the Wallabies hit hard by injuries, including the loss of captain John Eales, the odds are lengthening on them to win. New Zealand's TAB betting organisation has the All Blacks at near even odds for a win, while an Australian victory would pay a sevenfold return. With wintry weather forecast, and Carisbrook's terraces set to be packed with "scarfies" (Otago University students), Knox's proposed lap of honour could be more challenging than he thinks.
GCAT	President Bill Clinton charged on Sunday that there is an organised unprecedented Republican campaign against his wife Hillary, but said she has held up well under attacks. In an interview in the Chicago Tribune, Clinton said he was not surprised by Republicans' indirect criticism at their convention. "Well, it didn't surprise me; they've been doing it for five years now," Clinton said. "It has been part of their political strategy for five years." "There is no precedent for it," Clinton said, adding, "She is pretty strong and she has held up  right well,  I think." Even Eleanor Roosevelt could not have been more personally attacked, said Clinton, saying the former first lady "didn't have the kind of organised, disciplined, long-term movement that she has (had)." Clinton also struck back at Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole who took a verbal swing in his acceptance speech at Mrs. Clinton over her book about children, "It Takes a Village" when Dole said it doesn't take a village but that it takes a family to raise children. The attacks on his wife were "incongruous with the facts," said Clinton. "Look at Sen. Dole, for example," he added, saying he had respect for Dole's Second World War service and fighting back from serious wounds but that "a village" helped him recover. "How many times has he told the story about the people caring for him in the hospital and how this country invested in his healthg care?" Clinton asked. How many times has he talked about how he went back home to Russell, Kansas, and everybody worked to make him whole again?" Clinton said about Dole, "I certainly think that the village helped him."
GCAT	President Boris Yeltsin promised on Saturday to visit Ukraine in early June at the latest to end speculations about a growing rift between the two Slav neighbours, Interfax news agency said. Interfax quoted Yeltsin as telling Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma he would visit Ukraine irrespective of whether the political treaty which the two ex-Soviet republics want to sign is ready or not. Moscow and Kiev are at loggerheads over division of the former Soviet Black Sea fleet and differ on where the Russian share of warships should be based. Kiev has been alarmed by demands by some leading Russian politicians that Sevastopol, the current home base of the fleet in the Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, be designated for sole Russian use. Russia and Ukraine are also split on some economic and trade issues. Moscow and Kiev have so far failed to agree on the terms of a friendship treaty which would sort out major problems existing between them. Yeltsin has postponed his visit to Ukraine at least six times in the past two years. "I will visit Ukraine no matter whether the treaty is ready or not by then," Yeltsin told Kuchma. Some Russian political analysts have suggested that a protracted row between Moscow and Kiev and mutual suspicion between them could prompt Ukraine, which has so far stuck to a political nutrality, to seek closer links with NATO. Moscow, which protests against the western alliance's plans to grant membership to some Central and Eastern European countries, has been openly worried by a series of recent visits to Kiev by top NATO officials. "It's time to put an end (to Russian-Ukraine disputes) because the whole world is speculating about our relations," Yeltsin said. "Russia and Ukraine have good relations. You and I have good relations as well," he told Kuchma. Ukraine's pro-Russian Crimean peninsula was switching to Kiev time this weekend after three years of sticking to Moscow time, in a sign of easing tensions over the region. Ukraine's autonomous region of Crimea, two-thirds of its 2.7 million population Russians, introduced Moscow time three years ago as a token of its opposition to Kiev rule. But Ukraine has managed to reduce the influence of pro-Russian forces in the Crimea in the past two years. Last month the local parliament named a pro-Ukrainian politician as the region's new leader
CCAT	Potential bidders for Venezuelan bank Banco de Venezuela, the auction of which was called off on Wednesday, raised doubts on Thursday about the way in which the auction process was being handled. "Banco Santander was not ready to place a bid since there were still a number of outstanding issues concerning the process which had not been resolved," Jaime de Pinies, managing director of Santander Investment, told Reuters in a telephone interview.   Spanish bank Banco Santander and leading Peruvian bank Banco de Credito were the only banks to make a deposit to enter the auction that had been scheduled for Friday. But a top Banco de Credito executive told Reuters the bank subsequently made a decision not to bid because the minimum price of $275 million was too high. Esther de Margulis, president of the state Deposits Guarantee Fund, known as FOGADE, announced on Wednesday that the Banco de Venezuela auction had been called off indefinitely because of confusions about the auction process.   "Due to these conditions FOGADE thinks it will be impossible to carry out a successful auction and has decided to suspend the auction process," she told a news conference. The sale of the bank was thrown off course late last week when a local judge ordered the auction suspended while alleged irregularities were investigated. The same judge reversed her herself on Monday after receiving additional information from FOGADE, but the confusion shook the confidence of potential bidders.   Colombia's Banco Bogota and Germany's Dresdner Bank AG, which had expressed interest in Venezuela's third largest commercial bank, did not even place a deposit to take part in the auction. For Pinies, the successful privatization of Banco de Venezuela, which was taken over by FOGADE in August 1994, "will depend upon the satisfactory resolution of several issues." He did not elaborate. Another Banco de Credito official said the bank had heard the government may now change the terms of the sale, reserving a part of the bank for local investors.   While many in Venezuela complained the $275 million base price set for the bank as too low, the Banco de Credito official said the bank was probably overpriced given the state of Venezuela's economy and its banking sector in particular. The Venezuelan economy is due to record its third year of recession and is the country is grappling with an annual inflation rate of over 112 percent. A banking sector crisis in 1994 and 1995 wiped out over half of the commercial banking sector and cost the state over $10 billion. "To win the bank you're going to have to go into pricey territory. People aren't going to break their backs to get into Venezuela," the Banco de Credito official said. But the perceived risk surrounding investment in Venezuela also makes it an attractive time to enter the country, the official added. "It is a risk, but this is the time to buy into Venezuela because the imperfect scenario actually means you could get assets cheaply," he said. -- Paul Hughes, Caracas newsroom, 582 834405
CCAT	Compania Espanola de Petroleos SA (CEPSA) ) plans to start sales of butane gas in cannisters to Spanish homes sometime from October onwards, press reports said on Friday. No-one at CEPSA was immediately available for comment. To date, this market has been dominated by energy group Repsol SA. Analysts said Repsol's share price should not be particularly adversely affected by the entry of CEPSA into the market, which has been known for some time. "I don't think the share price has been affected because of that. As of some time ago what is weighing on (Repsol) is upcoming first half results, which are not expected to be particularly good," said an analyst at ODDO Securities. At 0940 GMT CEPSA was up 5 pesetas to 3,925, while Repsol was down 40 pesetas to 4,055. The Ibex-35 was up 0.29 points, 0.01 percent, to 4,060.44. "It's been known since a while ago that CEPSA-Elf wanted to compete in the butane market", he said. "Repsol has an around 98 percent market share at the moment. It's a big market, but its starting to disappear and be substituted by natural gas and liquid petroleum gas. In fact Repsol Butano is downsizing and readjusting its factories as it is difficult to increase in this market." -- Madrid newsroom +341 585 2160

CCAT	Japan's anti-monopoly watchdog is planning to study the merger of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd and Hokkaido Bank Ltd to assess any risks of the new bank monopolising the market in Hokkaido, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said on Tuesday. The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) was not immediately available for comment on the report in the leading Japanese business daily. Hokkaido Takushoku, Japan's 10th-largest commercial bank, and the smaller regional bank said earlier on Tuesday that they planned to merge in April 1998. Both of them are based in Sapporo, the largest city in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island. Hokkaido Takushoku and Hokkaido Bank are the largest and the second largest banks in Hokkaido, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said in its report, which appeared in its evening edition. They currently hold combined deposits of more than seven trillion yen, about two-thirds of the total deposits of about 11 trillion yen in Hokkaido, the paper said. The FTC will study whether other banks in Hokkaido can compete with the merged bank and if there is a possibility that the new bank will unfairly dominate the market, the newspaper said. After completing the study, the FTC may tell the new bank to transfer some of its deposits or branches to other banks, the newspaper said.

ECAT	Mexico plans to pre-pay $1 billion of some $12 billion that it still owes the International Monetary Fund from its emergency loan to Mexico following the 1994 peso crash, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said on Friday. Ortiz told Mexico City's Radio Red radio station that Mexico will also pay an additional $1 billion of the IMF loan that matures next year.  "We owe about $12 billion. We pre-paid $1 billion this year, we will probably prepay another $1 billion next year, and another billion comes due. Therefore, we should end next year owing about $10 billion."   Ortiz said the amount of money in a new three-year IMF loan program being negotiated could reach $6 billion. "We have still not set an amount. But we'd be probably be talking about $6 billion, something like that," he said. He said talks with the IMF on the program could start early next year. "We are in no hurry. It is not like last year, when our backs were up against the wall." He said the money would serve as a backup for future debt payments, but added he did not see any trouble for Mexico in meeting its obligations as it continues to be able to tap international debt markets. "This is not new debt ... it is a program whereby we would use the money only if necessary," he said. "In knowing that we have money if we need it, the markets should be calm," he added. -- David Luhnow, Mexico City newsroom 525 7289565
GCAT	British-sponsored talks involving rival Protestants and Roman Catholics started near Belfast on Friday in a bid to defuse rising tension over Northern Ireland's volatile "marching season". Secretary of State Mo Mowlam, said to be shuttling between the groups who were under the same roof but in separate rooms, pledged she would "leave no stone unturned" to prevent a repeat of clashes that swept the province last year. Officials said Protestant organisers of the most hotly disputed parade -- due on July 6 at Drumcree near Portadown -- and Roman Catholic objectors were in different offices at Hillsborough Castle, Mowlam's official residence. The talks were held after suspected Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas fired a rocket on a police patrol in Belfast on Thursday. The attack came less than 36 hours after Britain unveiled proposals to breathe new life into all-party peace talks. No one was injured in the rocket attack but British officials called it a discouraging development in the already tense climate before the marching season. Leaders of the Orange Order, a brotherhood that holds annual parades of pro-British allegiance, refuse to have face-to-face talks with Catholics whose homes are on the march route. The Catholics, who oppose rule from Britain and want the province merged into an all-Ireland state, say such parades are anti-Irish and inflammatory and should be confined to Protestant zones. Mowlam said in a statement that she and the participants wanted "to find an honourable and principled accommodation on this difficult issue... "These proximity talks represent a genuine attempt, in good faith, to find a way through a complex and highly emotive problem." She said prospects for progress would be helped by confidentiality, and that she would not make any further public comments while they were progress. Brendan Mac Cionnaith, a leader of the Catholic "Garvaghy Road Residents' Coalition" told reporters on Friday that he did not want to build false hopes of a quick solution to the problem at Portadown, where Protestants and Catholics are deeply split. "Let's be honest about it. People say that Portadown is a microcosm of the Six Counties (Northern Ireland). There are no quick fixes to the problems in the North and there are no quick fixes in Portadown," he said. Orange leaders entered the talks venue by a side-entrance, witnesses said. Earlier, Jeffrey Donaldson, a senior Orange official, said that Portadown "Orangemen" wanted to see if the situation could be moved forward. "I hope and trust that the other participants will take the same positive approach," he said on BBC radio. Mac Cionnaith told the BBC that after the events of last year, when police blocked the Orange march for four days but then relented after Protestant road blockades, the prospect of a parade was hard for Catholic residents to consider. The marching season climaxes on July 12 when tens of thousands of Protestants mark the 1690 "Battle of the Boyne" victory by King William of Orange over the Catholic King James and his Irish forces. If no compromise is reached over the Portadown parade, Mowlam and the police may be forced to ban it or a rival "street festival" that the Catholics plan to stage in its path. Tension has been high for many months as IRA guerrillas have stepped up their attacks with the backing of some local Catholics, and Loyalist guerrillas loyal to London have also entered into sporadic violence.

GCAT	The new Taleban Islamic movement government in Afghanistan said on Sunday no Islamic funeral service could be held for executed former president Najibullah. An announcement on the official Kabul Radio, monitored in Islamabad, said a "Namaz-i-Janaza (funeral prayer service) for Najibullah cannot be held because he was a communist and murderer of innocent Afghans". The Taleban militia executed Najibullah, his brother and two other aides on Friday immediately after capturing Kabul from the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. The four men were dragged from a United Nations compound where they had sheltered under U.N. protection since Najibullah was ousted in a palace coup in April 1992. Islamic mujahideen guerrillas subsequently took power from the collapsed former communist government after 14 years of civil war. The bloodied bodies of Najibullah and Shahpur were hanged from a concrete traffic post outside the presidential palace in Kabul for two days before being delivered anonymously to a hospital. The new government has not yet said what is to be done with the remains of the two men. Officials of the International committee of the Red Cross in Kabul said on Sunday Najibullah's family had contacted them. "We hope for a humanitarian solution," one official said. A large Islamic funeral prayer meeting for Najibullah was held on Saturday in the southwestern Pakistani town of Quetta, where speakers condemned his execution.

ECAT	Hungary's deep structural reforms should help it avoid trade and current account problems which could arise from rising economic growth, Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy said on Monday. Medgyessy told Reuters in an interview that the economic restrictions which Hungary introduced two years ago were necessary to create conditions for sustainable growth, but alone were not sufficient to spark growth. "The restrictions are not sufficient, because if (they) do not come along with structural reforms, (economic) balance problems may return," he said. "That's why the government's decision (last week) about the pension reform has an enormous significance." He added that the decision also outlined reform measures in the health care system. The pension and health care reforms will be operational in 1998 and 1999 and guarantee that ecconomic growth is sustainable, Medgyessy said. -- Sandor Peto, Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327 4040

ECAT	Pakistan may be unable to meet an IMF-set target of cutting its budget deficit to four percent of gross domestic product by June, Sartaj Aziz, widely expected to become the next finance minister, said on Tuesday. "The four percent target may take another year or so, rather than June this year, but I think on the whole the IMF package would not be difficult to implement if business confidence is restored and we are able to accelerate the industrial growth and increase exports," he told Reuters Financial Television.   Aziz, who was finance minister in the last Pakistan Muslim League (PML) government led by Nawaz Sharif, said he would accept whatever role Sharif assigned to him in the next cabinet. He was speaking as results from Monday's national and provincial elections showed the PML sweeping to a landslide victory against ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Aziz said the new government's priority would be to restore business confidence, revive the industrial sector and increase exports to stabilise the balance of payments. It would also seek to accelerate privatisation and economic reform. The International Monetary Fund agreed to resume and expand a stalled standby loan to Pakistan in December after the caretaker government promised to cut the deficit to four percent of GDP by the end of fiscal 1996/97 (July-June).
MCAT	The price of gold hung around the psychologically important $350.00 an ounce level in thin, trading on Tuesday, while the white metals showed more volatility. Bullion was fixed at $350.00 an ounce in the afternoon, virtually unchanged from $349.85 in the morning after trading in a tight range of around $1.70. "Gold certainly does not seem to be doing much today and trading is quite thin," a dealer noted. Dealers had said sharp losses on Wall Street on Thursday and Monday had helped to attract investors to gold, buoying prices. The effect was not likely to last much longer, unless the stock market saw further significant losses this week, they said. In contrast, silver, platinum and palladium have lost ground amid concerns about industrial demand in the aftermath of last week's hike in U.S. interest rates, dealers said. Silver started the day weaker after a slide below the $5.08 support line in New York on Monday triggered sell stops and sent prices lower. Further selling in early Europe, which dealers attributed to a New York investment fund, sent prices probing key support at $5.00 an ounce. But it bounced off lows and was last at $5.03/$5.05, off nine cents from Thursday's close. Still, some dealers said silver had acquired a downside bias and was vulnerable to the downside. "The $5.00 level has held for now, and $4.98 has been good technical support in the past. But longs have been getting out and we may be moving into a new, lower range," a dealer said. Platinum also came under pressure, and ticked lower after sustaining painful losses on Monday in New York. It was last at $368.50/$369.50, down $3.20 from Thursday's London close. But palladium came off its lows and was last indicated virutally unchanged at $146.25/$147.25. The market was still waiting for fresh news on Russian supplies of platinum group metals to Japan, which have been on hold since the beginning of the year. Industry officials have said they were waiting for a government decree to authorise shipments. --Lida Poletz, London newsroom +44 171 542 2936
ECAT	Israel's November consumer price index (CPI), due to published on Sunday, will show a rise of 0.4-0.6, economists predicted on Thursday. If inflation is 0.5 percent, the year-on-year inflation rate will be 10.9 percent (corrects from 9.6 percent). "By itself, the November inflation rate is within the government's target," said Shauli Katznelson, chief economist at Israel Discount Bank. But, he added, the shekel's weakening against the dollar in recent weeks will feed into higher consumer prices in the next two months. "The situation in November doesn't reflect what the indices will be in December and January," Katznelson said. Irit Oren, economist at the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce, said the Federation was expecting a lower CPI figure of no more than 0.4-0.5 percent. She said the major factor was housing prices. She predicted they would show a rise of no more than 0.5 percent in November. Home prices are customarily denominated in dollars and therefore rise when the dollar strengthens. But this factor has been offset by the weakness of the property market, Oren said. She added that the Federation expected housing prices to continue cooling inflation over the near term. As a result, the Federation is expecting continued low indices over the next few months. Discount, on the other hand, is expecting the CPI to show a relatively high 10 to 11 percent increase in the coming 12 months. Nevertheless, Katznelson said he expected that the Bank of Israel would lower the short-term interest rate at the end of December from the current 15.2 percent. Many analysts have said the central bank will not cut rates until the debate now going on in parliament over the 1997 budget is over. Parliament is expected to vote on the budget by December 31, a week after the Bank of Israel announces its monthly monetary programme. But Katznelson said the central bank would not wait. "Without relating to the budget, there is room to cut interest rates this month 0.5 percentage point," he said. Real interest rates are now six percent or more, which Katznelson said was "unreasonable" in a slowing economy. "I think that in a situation like this, you can't have a real rate of interest like you had this year in an overheated economy," he said. Katznelson said that over the next three months the central bank to lower rates a total of 1.2 percent point. - David Rosenberg, Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
ECAT	Lithuania will likely tap the international capital markets with a second 1997 bond issue in September or October, Finance Finister Algirdas Shemeta told Reuters in an interview.   "We will have a second issue in September or October...we have some preliminary thoughts on it," Shemeta said. Lithuania has already announced its intention to issue a $200 million eurobond this year which will be led by JP Morgan Securities. That bond will probably be launched in late spring or early summer, after the country acquires a credit rating from Standard and Poor's. "It is too early to disclose the amount of the second bond," Shemeta said. "It depends on the market conditions and rating, which we hope will be investment grade," he said. "It is too early to discolse the amount, but it could be higher than our first this year," he added. He also said that the ministry was mulling the idea of a yankee instead of a eurobond. --Ed Stoddard, Vilnius newsroom +370 2 22 35 18
ECAT	Russia is sticking to the conditions set out in its $10 billion International Monetary Fund loan program and will continue to do so, Economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin said on Tuesday. Asked about talks with Fund leaders held during this week's IMF-World Bank annual meetings, Yasin said, "we were able to state that the basic conditions of this program are fundamentally being fulfilled."   Yasin said Fund officials had congratulated Russian ministers on economic successes, especially lowering inflation. Yasin said Russia's monthly inflation rate was 0.3 percent in September after a 0.2 percent fall in prices in August. He said prices usually rise in October and November. "Evidently, we will see that, but I do not expect inflation to exceed one percent," he said.   Yasin also said Russia supported an initiative to reduce the debt of some of the world's poorest countries but could not join in the plan unless it was admitted to the Paris Club of creditor states. "We are prepared to adhere to these conditions but for them to be equally and mutually beneficial, Russia must be a member of the Paris Club," Yasin said.   Russia earlier this year reached agreement with the IMF on a three-year Extended Fund Facility loan but it is subject to strict monthly monitoring. Russia must meet certain monetary targets, which incldue the budget deficit and net reserves. Yasin said it could be difficult to meet the reserves target as it was sometimes necessary to use them to support the rouble, which is in a crawling peg against the dollar.   Central bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said last month that Russia spent $1.6 billion to support the rouble, when a faster than usual decline against the dollar made short-term Treasury bilol yields unattractive.. However, Yasin said Russia could meet the IMF conditions. "On the whole I think we will be able to," he said. A tranche of $330 million was held up in August because of concern over the low level of tax collection and Russian officials acknowledge the revenue side of the budget is a difficult problem.   Yasin said the tax and revenue issue had been discussed during the talks with the IMF. "Of course they expressed anxiety but it was recognised that the government is working very energetically to resolve these problems," he said. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank this week launched an initiative to offer poor, heavily indebted states relief on up to 80 percent of their debts, against the 67 percent relief currently on offer.   Yasin said Russia, which inherited the debts and assets of the former Soviet Union, was owed $140 billion. This exceeded the money it owed to, among others, the Paris Club. Russia wasnts all debts it is owed, including credits to buy military equipment, recognised and wants them to reflect the exchange rate at the time they were granted. Yasin said Russia was excluded from talks with some debtor states as it was not a member of the Paris Club. Many of Russia's debtors are African countries which were granted credits, often at artificially low rates, but are now unable to repay them. Russia has reached an agreement on rescheduling its own debts to the Paris Club and has been pressing for admission as a creditor. --Nigel Stephenson, Washington newsroom +1 202 898 8329
ECAT	A senior International Monetary Fund envoy said on Wednesday he needed assurances that the new Bulgarian government to be elected next month would follow the policies set out in any agreement reached now. "I need to be convinced of a widespread agreement on the continuity of policies in the programme. This is what we will be trying to ascertain over the next few days," IMF Europe One department director Michael Deppler told reporters. "I am hopeful that we can arrive at an arrangement, but we have not," said Deppler, who arrived in Sofia on Tuesday. IMF negotiators started talks with Bulgaria's interim government last month on a funding agreement linked to implementation of a fixed exchange rate system to help stabilise the crumbling economy and repay foreign debts. Speaking after meeting President Petar Stoyanov, Deppler said they had agreed on all general policies, but he needed assurances that the new government to take office after the April 19 general election would be committed to the reform programme being agreed now. "I am also equally concerned about a clear commitment and the continuity of policies on these issues that are important," said Deppler. He said he planned to seek guarantees of continuity in meetings with the main political parties. The favourite to win a majority in the new parliament is the Union of Democratic Forces and its coalition allies, whose mass protests ousted the ex-communist Socialist government in February two years before the end of its term. The UDF has shown clear commitment to market reform, liberalisation of trade rules and accelerated privatisation, all needed to haul the country out from economic collapse. But disagreements with the Fund over practical steps still remain. "There are still some points on which there is need for agreement, there are points for which there is no agreement, and there is also a need for the Fund to be assured of the continuity of policies," said Deppler. Different approaches to bank privatisation are one of the setbacks that is halting the agreement, said a local banker, who declined to be named. The IMF recommends to sell four ailing banks by year-end and seek reputable foreign institutions to manage two other big state banks. But local bankers would like loans to re-capitalise the ailing banks and then offer them to investors. The agreement, which Bulgarians officials still hope to sign by the end of this week, would include the interim government's programme on how to solve the grave banking and currency crisis, and this year's budget and structural reform plans. The programme will also contain legal amendments to bank laws designed jointly with the IMF to enable the introduction of a currency board in June. The currency board system would require levs in circulation to be matched by central bank reserves, severely curbing the financial powers of the government and the central bank, thus preventing the printing of money. Deppler, who plans to stay until the end of this week, said there were no practical obstacles in reaching a funding agreement with the interim cabinet by April. -- Sofia Newsroom 3592 981 4145

GCAT	An Australian immigration official said on Thursday that about 100 Sri Lankans had illegally arrived in Australia this year through a smuggling racket. "Investigations conducted by the (immigration) department indicate that there are people in Australia and Sri Lanka assisting people to get to Australia," a department official told Reuters. He said the Sri Lankans were using boarding passes given to them by people who checked in for flights but had no intention of travelling to Australia. In some cases, boarding passes for Australia were being swapped in airports for passes to other destinations, he said. The official said the Sri Lankans were originally arriving from either Hong Kong or Singapore, but these arrivals were decreasing after officers were sent there to assist with documentation checks. "In the past month, we have had no Sri Lankans come through Singapore, but they have moved to other Asian centres," he said. "Jakarta is now of concern." All the Sri Lankans that arrived here this year had applied for refugee status, but it was unsure if that would be granted, he said.

GCAT	Indonesian customs officials have detained two Singaporean traders after 16,527 Ecstasy pills were discovered at Jakarta's international airport, a customs official said on Monday. "The pills were wrapped in packets of M&Ms (multi-coloured chocolate sweets)," Nifsu Chasbullah, head of customs and excise at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, told Reuters by telephone. Chasbullah said the two Singaporeans, whose names were not released, had travelled to Indonesia from Amsterdam via Hong Kong on a Cathay Pacific flight which landed on Sunday morning. "Customs officers became suspicious after the baggage of the two men was X-rayed," he said, adding there was a strong suspicion the two men were working together as the pills were wrapped in an identical fashion. There was no immediate estimate of the street value of the drugs. He said the men were due to be handed over to police in metropolitan Jakarta later on Monday. Earlier this month, two other Singaporeans were caught at the same airport allegedly trying to smuggle 70,431 Ecstasy pills estimated to be worth $1.8 million in the largest single haul in Indonesia. At the time, customs officials said they had seized 239,048 Ecstasy pills since March this year. Ecstasy has gained widespread popularity in Indonesia's cities in recent years and the government has recently legislated to increase penalties for trafficking in and using it.
GCAT	Russia's communist-dominated parliament plans to debate an emotional call on Thursday to President Boris Yeltsin not to move the mummified corpse of Vladimir Lenin from its mausoleum on Red Square. The State Duma lower house, whose tsarist predecessor was abolished by Lenin when he installed the dictatorship of the Communist party after the 1917 revolution, voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to debate the non-binding resolution entitled "Prevent an Act of Vandalism!". Emotions were stirred by a remark by Yeltsin last week about a possible referendum on the issue, although in 1990 he came out against evicting Lenin from Red Square. The communist legislators who drafted the motion quoted Jesus Christ and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church at the time of Lenin's death in 1924 to back up their argument that re-interring the body would be tantamount to sacrilege. "In a civilised society, it is accepted that historic memorials should be preserved and the burial sites of its leading figures not touched, that national shrines should be honoured," the resolution said. Democrats say Lenin should be re-interred. Historians say Lenin himself wanted a modest burial in St. Petersburg. The communists said forces around the president wanted to "re-write history" and "wipe from the national memory everything linked to the Soviet period, its relics, memorials and shrines". They also invoked UNESCO, saying the mausoleum from which generations of Soviet leaders reviewed parades on Red Square was an integral part of the U.N.-protected Kremlin heritage site. Lenin's successors virtually deified the founder of the Soviet state and placed him at the centre of a communist system of values that functioned as a quasi-religion for seven decades. However, rarely if ever would Soviet communists explicitly have called the tomb a "shrine". Today's nationalistic communist party has reconciled itself with the Orthodox Church, whose priests and believers were persecuted in Soviet times. Once visited by millions, Lenin's tomb is still open to the public but draws smaller crowds. Since January, it has been closed while embalmers give the mummy its regular maintenance.

CCAT	The Bank of France said on Thursday it made a 1996 net profit of 1.21 billion francs, compared to 1.37 billion in 1995. The central bank made a gross operating profit of 2.84 billion francs, compared to 3.23 million francs in 1995, it said in a statement. It paid tax on 1.27 billion francs of profit. The reduced profit was mainly due to lower interest rates in money market tenders. The central bank also continued a policy of provisioning started last year, it said, but gave no figure for 1996. It made provisions of 1.20 billion francs in 1995. The Bank was made independent from state control in 1994.
MCAT	Wall Street stocks hovered slightly off their session highs in midafternoon activity on Wednesday, with the Dow holding solidly above the 7000 level.

GCAT	NATO foreign ministers, fresh from clinching a landmark security pact with Russia, met on Thursday to start selecting which former Warsaw pact countries should be invited to join the alliance next July. The meeting in the historic Portuguese town of Sintra will also review efforts to overhaul the alliance's outdated Cold War command structure and boost partnership programmes for countries which fail to gain alliance admittance. "Our meetings in Sintra demonstrate that NATO is well on track for the 21st century. The Atlantic Alliance, together with its partners, remains determined to meet the challenges of the new era," NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told the opening session. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are expected to be invited to join the alliance in Madrid next month, but Romania and Slovenia -- strongly backed by some of the current 16 alliance members -- are also pushing hard. U.S. officials say Secretary of State Madeleine Albright goes into the talks representing a U.S. position in favour of inviting three rather than five. NATO diplomats say the largest alliance countries, mindful of the political implications of effectively committing their troops to defend other states, tend to favour a limited enlargement, at least for now. "Britain, France and the United States are very aware of the historical factors that created the alliance and lean towards moving slowly," said one alliance envoy. Some countries however, using the argument that the alliance is evolving from a defence union into a continent-wide security organisation, want to spread membership more widely. "In the end, the alliance operates by consensus, and caution will probably win out," added the envoy. NATO officials say no decision will be taken at the closed-door Sintra meeting, but for the first time countries will state their preferences openly. "We will be searching for a consensus," said one NATO official. He said Solana would undertake a visit of applicant countries' capitals to inform them formally of NATO's decision in the two weeks before the meeting in Madrid on July 8-9. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said the meeting would play a key role in preparing a successful Madrid summit. "It would be strange that now we have solved the central questions, we cannot make progress on these inner questions," he told reporters when arriving for the meeting. The Sintra meeting comes two days after NATO agreed a landmark pact with Russia, giving Moscow a key role in an emerging post-Cold War European security system and effectively removing its opposition to at least a limited alliance enlargement. But Russia has since made clear it would still balk at former Soviet Republics winning membership of the organisation which won the Cold War without a shot being fired. NATO countries, keen to avoid new divisions in Europe between former communist countries from central and eastern Europe, also intend to use the meeting to launch a much-improved Partnership for Peace (PFP) programme. "This will be a Turbo-charged PFP with much more consultation and scope for joint exercises, the aim is that eventually there will be little difference between a full member and an active partner," said one official. In the margins of the meeting, the ministers are set to initial a security pact with Ukraine giving that country a special status above that of partnership, but not going as far as the deal with Russia. British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said NATO was committed to enlargement eastwards, but gave no clues as to which countries may gain entry at the first attempt -- the alliance's first expansion for two decades. "We are determined that NATO be widened, we are determined that the new democracies of eastern Europe be able to join the family of democratic nations," he told reporters. The meeting is also due to review a reform of the alliance's command structures to make it more flexible and allow it to take on more out-of-area peacekeeping peace missions and review its current operation in Bosnia.

GCAT	Until a cruel midnight assault two years ago, Nurun Nahar was a pretty teenage girl, full of hope. But Nahar's dreams were shattered when a man broke into her house and sprayed nitric acid on her face for spurning his romantic advances. The jilted man was aided by four accomplices, Nahar said. "Suddenly I woke up and found myself in a hell of pain. Everything became dark. My face was burning," said the 17-year-old former school student, now unemployed. Nahar was once envied by her friends because of her beauty. But the acid deformed her entire face. Now, whenever she leaves her home, Nahar wraps herself with a sheet of white cloth. "I cannot show my face to anybody. I cannot tell how painful this experience is," she said. HUNDREDS BECOME ACID VICTIMS EVERY YEAR Nahar is not alone in her suffering. In a growing phenomenon, hundreds of Bangladeshi girls are becoming victims of acid attacks each year by disgruntled lovers, husbands demanding dowry and perverts who all seek to permantly disfigure their victims. "An acid attack is the kind of violence Bangladeshi women dread most nowadays. This is a new form of perversion in society," said Nasreen Huq, convenor of a Dhaka-based feminist group, Naripakkho, which helps acid victims. Doctors said attackers mainly used nitric acid, which can be obtained from chemical stores and school laboratories. A report by the Coordination Council Human Rights Bangladesh (CCHRB), a umbrella organisation of human rights groups, listed 89 acid attacks in 1996 alone. "There are many more incidents that are not reported in the newspapers or brought to the notice of the law," Huq said. "It is really reaching an alarming proportion," she told Reuters. Usually, the victims are young girls who have rebuffed male advances. Most of 116 victims detected by Naripakkho over the past few years were aged between 11 and 20 years. "The common cause is rejection. Most became victims as they did not respond to romantic advances by young men," said Huq. "Attackers are sometimes dowry-hungry husbands," she added. According to the CCHRB report, 103 women were murdered in 1996 due to dowry-related attacks. PUNISHMENT IS DEATH Bangladesh introduced the death penalty for acid attacks several years ago to try to stamp out the practice but its application has been slow and inefficient. With help from Naripakkho, Nahar took her case to a court which recently handed down death sentences on two of her attackers. The two have appealed to a higher court and a verdict is pending. Police said the two death sentences were the first for acid attacks. They said about a dozen other perpetrators had been sentenced to prison for terms of up to three years. Human rights workers said the cases were difficult to prosecute due to a lack of evidence and because victims' families were often warned by offenders of more severe consequences if they seek redress within the law. The killing and trafficking of women and children and forcible prostitution are also punishable by death in Bangladesh, but police and legal sources say there have been minimal convictions. NARIPAKKHO TRIES TO HELP VICTIMS Naripakkho started working with acid victims in 1995. "What we are basically providing them with is moral support. We are telling them that life has not ended," Huq said. The organisation also approaches the police on behalf of some victims, and asks hospitals to provide treatment. Doctors at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital said treatment facilities for acid burns were scant in Bangladesh. Huq said her organisation had contacted plastic surgeons in foreign countries to try to arrange free treatment for victims. "We got a positive response from Indian doctors," she said.

MCAT	The Bank of Canada said on Thursday it is considering changing the rules governing federal debt auctions in Canada to prevent manipulation and maintain investor confidence. The new rules under consideration were included in a discussion paper released on Thursday which asks market participants for their views on the changes. The central bank said the new rules are designed to avert so-called squeezes, which take place when just one or a few investors buy up an entire bond or T-bill issue. These investors then hike the price for resale to other investors who need to own the issue. "It is very important that the confidence of direct participants and end-investors in the auction process be sustained. Auctions should be free of, and be perceived as being free of, manipulation," the bank said in the paper. Under the new rules dealers and customers bidding at auctions would have to dislose their holdings of the debt issues being bid for. Bidding limits would also be put in place for customers buying through dealers. Penalties would be imposed on those who break the new rules. The central bank also said it would step up its surveillance of bond and T-bill auctions. Analysts said the push for new regulation is being prompted by a variety of factors, including a decline in the federal government's borrowing requirements. Canada's budget deficit has shrunk since Finance Minister Paul Martin took office and it is expected to decline further in coming years. As a result the amount of debt being auctioned will also shrink, increasing the likelihood that entire issues may be bought up by one or just a few market participants. The growing size and influence of many market players, as well as the consolidation of the major banks and investment dealers also increase the need for the new regulations, the central bank said. "These things taken together point to a need to clarify and strengthen the rules. This has not just come up out of nowhere. It's been under discussion for some time," said a Department of Finance official. The official noted there has also been an increase in anecdotal reports of squeezes, particularly with T-bills, which mature in one year or less. The Canadian government has reduced the size of its T-bill tenders over the past several months and has shifted more of its borrowing into the less volatile bond markets. "The T-bill sector is the area in which we've experienced the most frequently reported problems, although it has also been in the bond market," the official said. The Bank of Canada is asking market participants for comments on the proposed rules by March 31, 1997. More discussion papers are expected in the new year, and new regulations would likely be put in place by this time next year, the official said. ((Reuters Toronto Bureau (416) 941-8100))

ECAT	The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday it has approved credits totalling $430 million for Romania, giving a boost to the new centrist government's economic reform programme. An IMF statement said the 13-month standby agreement was approved on Tuesday at an Executive Board meeting in Washington. The first instalment of about $86 million was being made available immediately, it said. Four additional quarterly instalments of the same size were "subject to observance of performance criteria and a review of the exchange rate policy". Two reviews of economic performance would be conducted in mid-August and mid-February 1998. The government and central bank had viewed IMF approval as the gateway for increasing foreign investment levels --among the lowest in ex-communist eastern Europe. "Foreign investors are reassured by recent developments in Romanian politics and this support from the IMF confirms that Romania is likely to pursue an economic policy attractive to foreign investors," one analyst said by telephone from London. Another analyst welcomed the news as positive for Romania's international image. There was "a strong appetite", she said, for future Eurobond issues. The IMF suspended credits to Romania last year after saying the leftist government had overspent and hobbled foreign exchange markets ahead of elections it lost last November. The poll defeat ended seven years of rule by ex-communists. The new government, committed to narrowing the gap in living standards with ex-communist Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, launched talks with the IMF and other international lenders immediately after taking office. To prove its mettle ahead of the IMF decision, the government rammed an austerity budget through parliament in record time and secured approval of laws on bank privatisation and ownership of land by foreigners. It also proceeded with a decision to close dozens of loss-making farms and factories. The Fund's statement said the main objectives of the government's reform programme were to reduce monthly inflation to about two percent in the second half of the year, cut the current account deficit to $1.4 billion from last year's $2.3 billion and increase foreign exchange reserves. It has set a budget deficit target of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product, down from last year's 5.8 percent. The statement acknowledged the need to "cushion the most vulnerable part of the Romanian population" by increasing social security spending to 10 percent of GDP. The government launched its stabilisation programme in February, introducing tough monetary policies and freeing prices on staples and utilities which pushed monthly inflation to over 30 percent last month. An IMF mission in Romania this month said the government's 1997 inflation target of 90 percent was feasible but ambitious after posting 76.5 percent in the first quarter alone.

GCAT	Jesper Parnevik curled in a 60 feet birdie putt at the last hole to snatch a one shot lead from holder Colin Montgomerie in the third round of the Lancome Trophy on Saturday. The Swede's four-under-par 66 was matched by the Scot, who appeared set for first place himself until he bogeyed the 209 yards final hole after his tee shot left him with a bad lie in a greenside bunker. Then Parnevik, playing behind, rolled in his swinging putt from just off the front of the green for his nine-under total of 201, one better than Montgomerie. Ian Woosnam, Montgomerie's rival for the European Order of Merit title, could only manage a 70 and was four shots off the lead after sharing it overnight. With Woosnam on five-under were fellow Britons Jamie Spence, the first round leader who carded a 67, and Ross Drummond, who shot 69. Parnevik, now a U.S. Tour player, is ineligible for Ryder Cup points in Europe but Montgomerie insisted that he will be needed for next year's defence against the Americans. "I'm mightily impressed by Parnevik. He's one of the top five players in Europe," Montgomerie said.   Montgomerie pointed to this weekend's President's Cup in which the Americans lead an International team containing no Europeans by 7-1/2 points to 2-1/2 to justify his support for Parnevik. "The international team is as strong if not stronger that we are and they're getting thrashed. We will need our strongest team," he said. "He should be in the Ryder Cup team, definitely." Parnevik responded by saying he would like to think he was one of the leading Europeans, "but it's all down to politics, like anything else". The Swede, runner-up in the 1994 British Open, has committed himself to playing predominantly on the U.S. Tour rather than trying to qualify in Europe. Parnevik said he was surprised at his score because he was up all night with food poisoning. "I'd have taken a 70, especially after a bogey at the second hole," he said. "I felt I played sloppy golf today. I was very tired." But he birdied the next two and the eighth and ninth, lost a shot at the 14th before a birdie at 16 set up his glorious final putt. Montgomerie was quickly out of the blocks with birdies at the first two holes, which he bogeyed in Friday's round, and the fourth, where he made a 30-foot putt. He made further birdies at the 10th and 17th before his dropped shot at the last. "One behind is fine. I'm quite confident in what I'm doing," said the Scot, who regained the Order of Merit lead from Woosnam with his record-breaking victory last Sunday in the European Masters. Woosnam has been troubled by a bad back but said that had no bearing on his round. "I just didn't drive the ball well today," he said.
GCAT	Three Slovenian rightwing parties, which won half the seats in parliament in a general election, said on Thursday they had agreed a cooperation pact to improve their bid to form the next government. The rightist "Slovenian Spring" alliance of the conservative People's Party, centre-right Social Democrats and Christian Democrats together won 45 out of 90 parliamentary seats in the November 10 election. They missed out on an absolute majority by just one seat in Slovenia's second general election since declaring independence from former Yugoslavia. "The agreement, that will result in tight cooperation between the three parties in parliament, could be signed before the first session of the new parliament on November 28," Christian Democrat spokesman Valentin Hajdinjak told Reuters. The parties are attempting to unseat Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, whose centre-left Liberal Democrats emerged as the single biggest party in the election, winning 25 seats. The alliance was seeking to form a goverment with People's Party leader Marjan Podobnik as premier and, if successful, would swing Slovenian politics firmly to the right. The People's Party, which won big support from farmers suspicious of Ljubljana's bid to join the European Union, is the strongest of the alliance parties with 19 seats. The alliance has already approached the Liberal Democrats, offering them a place in government if Drnovsek steps down as premier. But the Liberal Democrats have refused, saying they will only take part in the next administration if Drnovsek remains government leader. Hajdinjak said the "Spring" parties were confident of gaining enough support among other smaller parties to form a working government even if Liberal Democrats refused to join in. The cooperation pact has made Drnovsek's task of forming the next government much harder. He has to prise one or two of the "Spring" parties out of the alliance to have any chance. President Milan Kucan said on Tuesday he would choose a candidate for prime minister within 30 days of the first parliamentary session, during which time he would hold consultations with the leaders of all parties in parliament. Kucan was likely first to call on Drnovsek to try to form a coalition government but may be forced to turn to Podobnik if the Liberal Democrats fail to break the rightist alliance.
GCAT	Hungarian soccer club Ujpest plans to become the first club in Eastern Europe to go public, with a flotation on the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE). Club president, former Olympic fencing champion Bence Szabo, said he plans a radical overhaul of the club's structure in order to attract foreign investment. "Football is no longer just a sport," Szabo told Reuters. "It has become part of the entertainment business." Currently the soccer team is part of a larger sports club with 15 sections including water-polo and fencing. Szabo said he wants to create an independent football club, owned by a public limited company which will float on the BSE. Ujpest's 70-member executive will hold a general meeting on Monday to vote on separating out the football activities and debate the move to a new structure. "Clubs don't live only from ticket receipts but from merchandising and a whole range of business activities. We need to change and my generation sees that Hungarian football has to be built on solid business foundations," said the 35-year-old Szabo, who won gold for Hungary in Barcelona in 1992. "Going to the stock market would also allow small businessmen and supporters to have a stake in the club," he said, adding that the move could also attract much-needed foreign investment. The club is currently in talks with French club Metz and Szabo said he hoped that others would show interest as Hungary lines up to become one of the first new members of the European Union. Szabo would not be drawn on whether Ujpest would sell a majority share in the initial public offering. The move is another sign of the increasingly important role private investors are taking in Hungarian football. Two years ago, current champions MTK were bought by a Hungarian company Sportinvest, owned by Hungarian Gabor Varszegi, CEO of consumer goods retailer Fotex . After winning promotion to the first division in 1995, MTK used Varszegi's cash to recruit many of Hungary's top players and this season won the league and cup double. Brian Sturgess, of ING Barings in London, a media analyst who specialises in football stocks, said he welcomed Ujpest's plans. "In Eastern Europe there is a move away from the communist-era model of the giant sports club financed by a ministry and there is a clear move towards private capital. This will accelerate, especially with the certain increase in the value of TV soccer rights in the region." Sturgess said he believed an Ujpest flotation could be successful provided it attracts larger investors. "Of course there will be local interest from small investors but to really succeed they need to attract institutional investors. "The traditional emerging markets investor may stay away but I am sure that the communication funds and leisure funds would be interested." Ujpest, known as Ujpest Dozsa during the communist era, when they were backed by Hungary's Interior Ministry, are one of Hungary's most successful clubs. They have won the Hungarian championship 19 times and in 1969 reached the final of Europe's Inter-Cities Fairs Cup - the forerunner of the UEFA Cup. But following the change of system in 1989 the club struggled and in 1993 had to win a play-off in order to stay in the first division. Last season, however, they finished second in the league earning a place in the UEFA Cup.

MCAT	Australian bond futures extended Tuesday's consolidative sell-off in after-hours trading as U.S. Treasuries also posted a modest correction. The September 10-year bond futures contract ended SYCOM at 92.900, down from Tuesday's 92.925 pit close and having dipped to 92.875 at one stage. The month's steep rising trendline, and last leg of the rally from 91.700 in April, is being put under pressure at 92.880, and the market needs to close above this level to maintain the bullish trend, analysts said.   The 10-year bond, through the now-expired June contract, touched a 3-1/4 year high on Monday of 93.090. The corrective pullback across the curve has brought the market back from its extreme overbought levels of over 80 percent on relative strength indices to just under 75 percent. Local data for Wednesday remains thin with only Westpac's leading index for April due for release, leaving the market vulnerable to movements in offshore markets. The easier tone in the U.S. ended a three-day run of price gains with a benign CPI report for May having been largely built in after the rally which followed Friday's weak PPI.   -- Colin Brinsden 61-2 9373-1800
MCAT	The overnight interbank rate closed at 5.5 percent on aggressive lending by foreign banks long on ringgit, dealers said on Wednesday. The lending started late in the day after the overnight had earlier stabilised around 6.5/7.0 percent after opening at 8.0 percent, they said.   "It was quite sudden and the banks were lending all the way down from 7.0 percent. It was last taken at 5.5 percent," said a dealer with a Malaysian bank. "Foreign banks were long on ringgit and had little choice but to offer back to the market due to the curbs on swaps transactions," he said. Bank Negara announced on Sunday that local banks would have to limit their non-trade related currency swaps to $2.0 million with each overseas customer, from Monday. It said the move was to help control interest rates more effectively. The central bank has in the last two weeks been trying to lower interest rates in an effort to boost domestic economic activity. Dealers said the overnight rate also fell ahead of the return of some funds at the end of the week. There will be a maturity of Bank Negara bills worth one billion ringgit on Friday. -- Syed Azman (603-201 4813)
MCAT	U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets Monday were at a standstill, with no sales of slaughter steers or heifers reported, feedlot sources said. Packer bids from $63.00 to $64.00 per cwt were passed by owners pricing cattle at $65.00 to mostly $66.00, they said. Feedlot cattle prices this week were expected steady to $1.00 higher, compared with last week's sales at $64.00, the dealers said. Prices were seen lifted by firm beef demand on Friday. Prices also were seen underpinned by lighter-weight cattle, compared with a year ago, and the ability of feedlots to remain current in their marketings, they said.   Support this week also was expected from only slight increases in this week's showlists, sources said. Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma showlists were pegged near 81,000 head, up 2,000 from a week ago, sources there said. Kansas showlists were estimated near 78,500, up 700 from a week ago. Nebraska's showlist was estimated near 82,000 head, down 1,000 from last week. Support in fed cattle prices could be offset by lower to Monday's sharply lower CME live cattle futures and slow beef sales, versus active sales at higher prices on Friday, market sources noted.

GCAT	Israel, fearful of more bombings after last week's suicide blasts, was on heightened security alert on Sunday as the deadline passed for an Islamic militant ultimatum. Police said they were taking every precaution as tension rose in the light of a demand that Israel free all Palestinian prisoners by 9 p.m. (1800 GMT). Shortly before the deadline passed, police reported that a Palestinian was found shot dead near Carmel Jewish settlement in the West Bank, not far from Hebron. The circumstances of the man's death were not clear. Palestinians said he was shot by a Jewish settler in a passing car. Police said they had two separate reports from the area: of shots fired by unidentified gunmen in a car and a body found. "We don't know if there is a connection," a police spokeswoman said. The demand for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners was made in a leaflet claiming Wednesday's double suicide bombing, which killed 13 people and wounded 170, in the name of the Islamic militant Hamas group. Some Israeli and Palestinian officials voiced doubts, however, about the leaflet's authenticity. Israel announced no plans to free anyone. The leaflet did not spell out what would happen if the ultimatum was refused. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet that Israel would not honour peace deals it signed with Yasser Arafat unless the Palestinian leader cracked down on militants. "If Arafat honours his commitments in the agreement, chiefly to fight terrorism, the agreement will survive. If he doesn't, we will not keep up our part of the bargain unequivocally," an official statement quoted Netanyahu as saying. He later told CBS-TV's "Face the Nation": "The whole peace is at stake. Arafat must make a choice and make it now." But top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, in an interview on CNN television network, said Arafat had offered to join Netanyahu in fighting militants and had been spurned. "Mr Netanyahu, instead of accepting President Arafat's offer to join him in fighting terror and the enemies of peace, he declared a series of collective punishment measures against the Palestinian people," Erekat said. Israeli U.N. Ambassador-designate Dore Gold, with Erekat in the studio, asked if Netanyahu had spurned Arafat's offer, said: "Well, I don't think that's exactly correct". Gold did not elaborate but said that prior to the attack on Wednesday, Palestinian security officials were making cooperation in the fight against militants conditional on Israel making "certain tangible concessions". Palestinians have demanded Israel halt Jewish settlement of occupied Arab lands which they say pre-empts peace talks. Troops overnight arrested another 37 Palestinians in the West Bank suspected of involvement in Islamic militant groups, bringing to 116 the number arrested since the bombing in the main Jewish street market. Israeli Police Commissioner Assaf Hefetz, asked if Israel had specific information about more attacks, told army radio: "It's more than just an estimate. We have a series of...details that point to this possibility." He said after four days of investigation, officials were still uncertain who carried out Wednesday's attack. Thousands of Israeli police guarded shopping malls, bus stations and other places where crowds gather in Israel's main cities, and stopped cars for inspection along key roads. The suicide bombing revived memories of a bombing spree last year in which Islamic miliants struck four times in nine days, killing 57 people. Israel suspended already dormant peace talks with the Palestinians as a result of Wednesday's bombing and sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip, barring tens of thousands of Palestinians from reaching their jobs in the Jewish state. Palestinians accused Israel of imposing collective punishment on Palestinians and expressed hope U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, due later this week on another mediation mission, could put peacemaking back on track. U.S. Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox Television he backed Israel taking action if necessary on Palestinian territory and condemned Arafat for not fighting militants. Top Israeli security officials met their Palestinian counterparts overnight to discuss the investigation into Wednesday's bombing, security sources said. But Jibril al-Rajoub, the head of the Palestinian preventive security in the West Bank, said the meetings did not constitute a renewal of security cooperation. Arafat is to go to Jordan on Monday for talks with King Hussein on the deepening crisis, his office said. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy's office said he would go to Egypt on Tuesday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak.
CCAT	Two of Switzerland's top financial groups, Credit Suisse Group and Winterthur Group, Monday announced plans to merge and create one of the world's leading financial service providers. The deal catapults Credit Suisse Group into the position of undisputed leader among Switzerland's Big Three banks, taking place amid deep structural changes in global financial markets and fierce competition in the insurance industry. "The merger is a powerful, forward-looking response to developments in the financial services market," said Lukas Muehlemann, chief executive of the combined group. The stock market reacted positively to the announcement and industry analysts were also in favour of the move, noting it is likely to put pressure on Union Bank of Switzerland UBS and Swiss Bank Corp. SBC to meet the challenge. "I think this puts pressure on the other big Swiss banks," said Thomas Della Putta of private bankers Pictet & Cie. The merger comes after months of intense speculation about Winterthur and only days after financier Martin Ebner said he wanted to acquire a majority of the insurer. One analyst questioned whether the timing of the merger was dictated by the stake amassed in Winterthur by Ebner's BZ Group. The combination of Credit Suisse, currently Switzerland's second-largest bank, with Winterthur, the third-largest insurer, should result in gains of 300 million to 350 million Swiss francs ($199 million to $232 million) within three years from higher income and cost-cutting. A maximum of 500 jobs worldwide will be lost due to attrition, but the companies said in a joint statement that there would be no layoffs. "The two companies are now in an even better position to provide their personal and corporate customers with attractive financial products combining the advantages of banking and insurance solutions," the companies said. Shareholders of both companies will be asked to approve the deal on Sept. 5. Assuming approval, Credit Suisse Group will offer Winterthur shareholders to swap one of their shares for 7.3 Credit Suisse shares. Winterthur will then become part of the Credit Suisse Group, boosting its total assets to around 700 billion francs ($463 billion), giving it a market capitalisation of more than 50 billion ($33 billion) and around 700 billion francs ($463 billion) in assets under management. The merger illustrates the blurring distinction between banks and insurance companies, where market position and market presence is becoming increasingly critical. "Strategically, this makes sense for Credit Suisse. The general trend in Europe clearly goes toward bancassurance. It's not the insurance companies that need the banks, it's the banks that need the insurance companies to be more competitive," said Della Putta. "The merger will allow the group to exploit to the full the advantages of being a banassurance provider in all customer and market segments," the companies said. Credit Suisse Group, reporting its half-year results early due to the merger announcement, said preliminary figures showed net profit surged 70 percent to around 1.41 billion Swiss francs ($933 million) in the first half of 1997. Net profit growth was at the high end of growth estimates, which had run between 45 and 90 percent.
ECAT	Statistics New Zealand is laying the ground for a five-yearly review of the consumers' price index, a process which almost certainly will result in debate about the index's influence on monetary policy, the New Zealand Press Association reported on Tuesday. Deputy government statistician Ian Ewing said the composition of an advisory committee, including international experts in the composition of consumer price indexes, was currently under discussion with Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson.   Once established, the committee would complete consideration of papers and conceptual issues before rebalancing of the CPI got under way in the second half of next year. Ewing told NZPA uses of the CPI had changed over the years, and representation on the committee would reflect those changes. While employer and union groups had been major users in the past, that had dwindled with the demise of centralised wage fixing after 1984, and the Treasury and Reserve Bank interests would be present on the committee given the importance of the CPI in monetary policy.   represent producers, consumers, employers and employee groups, major government policy agencies, in particular the Reserve Bank and Treasury, and possibly other groups within the community who may be affected by government policy as it affects prices," Ewing said. "Papers are presented to the committee for advice and guidance and, as a result of that, we carry out a five-year rebase of the CPI, and the extent of that is governed in part by the committee."   Ewing said rebalancing of the CPI would involve considerations such as changes in spending behaviour in the last five years. Households, for instance, have been spending less on clothing due to the impact of deregulation of the industry reducing prices, while imports of used Japanese cars have reduced transport costs and, thus, overall spending. Statistics New Zealand's household economic survey had also found that people were spending less of their income on housing, Ewing said.   However, the treatment of housing is likely to come in for some solid debate with the Reserve Bank seen as arguing to have interest rates removed from any measure of its cost. Ewing said there were opposing schools of thought on whether house ownership should be treated as an item of shelter or as an investment. If it was accepted that housing was a consumption rather than an investment good, then there were issues of how housing was priced.   "Do you assume the cost is what you would get if you rented the house out, as against the actual costs of owning the house -- interest paid on mortgages, that sort of thing," Ewing said. But even if elements of the CPI were removed for monetary policy purposes, a broader-based index could be more appropriate than one confined to measuring the impact of inflation on households, he said. However, another index for monetary policy purposes would do little to allay Reserve Bank concerns about the CPI's impact in setting inflationary expectations, he suggested.   "The CPI has been the most prominent, well-known measure of inflation... even though it may have some technical limitations as a tool for measuring inflation," Ewing said. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746

MCAT	The Montenegro Stock Exchange reported on Wednesday a 37 percent increase in its March turnover following two months of sharp declines and traders attributed the rise to an improved liquidity of banks. Total turnover jumped to 33.9 million dinars ($6.14 million) in 84 transactions, from 21.35 million dinars in 87 deals, the bourse said. Short-term securities accounted for 21 million dinars or 61.88 percent of the monthly total. Most securities carried a 0.4 percent daily interest while maturity ranged between 10 and 15 days. The Giro money market, where banks trade surplus liquidity, accounted for the remaining 12.9 million dinars of the total. "Liquidity of the banking sector has improved over the last month, but we can't say why, since there were no changes in the central bank's policy," a trader said. Turnover also rose after the Montenegrin Commodity Reserve Agency offered for sale bonds to finance preparations for the forthcoming tourist season, said Natasa Bulajic of the bourse. The bond issue was in line with the latest National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) changes in its reserve requirement regulation. Yugoslav commercial banks set aside 15 percent of their deposits and the same percentage of their interbank lending with the NBY to fulfil the reserve requirement. But since the end of February, the reserve requirement account in the NBY has been divided into two separate accounts, so that banks can use only 50 percent of the amount to bridge their daily liquidity problems. The other 50 percent is transferred to a special account and can be invested in securities issued by state-owned Serbian and Montenegrin commodity reserve agencies. Serbia needs funds to finance stockpiling of produce harvested late in 1996, while Montenegro will use money to finance preparations for the 1997 tourist season. The Montenegrin Commodity Reserve Agency issued 20 million dinars worth of 6-month bonds carrying an interest rate equivalent to the NBY discount rate set at a monthly 2.5 percent for April. In March alone, the agency sold 5.92 million dinars worth of bonds. But since March 18, banks are no longer allowed to buy bonds directly from the Commodity Reserve Agency. In future they will do the job via NBY. The Montenegro Stock Exchange also said NBY returned to the bourse with its short-term bonds for the first time in nearly nine months. The central bank offered for sale a 10 million dinar tranche of its 20-day bonds, to meet demand for its securities. But investors initially bought only 0.3 million worth of bonds. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254 ($1 = 5.5219 Yugoslav dinars)
MCAT	Despite higher U.S. Treasury yields corporate debt offerings continue to pour into the market as issuers rush to square away business ahead of next week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), dealers said. "The tone is still very upbeat as evidenced by the number of deals we continue to see," said one syndicate source. "Basically, people are looking to get business done now." Dealers said issuers are rushing to get their financing done now as the threat of rising interst rates looms over the market.   Just a week ago, the yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond closed at a 6.85 percent level, currently the yield on the bond stands at 6.96 percent making it more expensive for U.S. corporations to finance debt. The FOMC, the policy setting arm of the Federal Reserve Board, is scheduled to meet on March 25th to vote on monetary policy. Dealers said that despite higher borrowing costs corporations have opted to issue now, rather than later, as demand for paper continues to be very strong.   Leading the investment-grade parade in the new issue market is a $300 million deal for Petro Geo-Services. The offering is expected to consist of Baa3/BBB-minus rated 10-year senior unsecured notes. Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities will act as lead underwriter for the deal. Also, Fletcher Challenge is expected to tap the market with a $320 million Baa2/BBB rated debt offering via Merrill Lynch & Co. The deal is expected to consist of $200 million in 10-year debt and $120 million in 20-year debt, sources said.   In addition, Korea Export-Import Bank is expected to issue $500 million in an A1-A-minus rated global 10-year issue, putable in the fifth year, sources said. Price talk on the issue is 48 basis points over U.S. Treasuries. Lehman Brothers is expected to underwrite the deal. Also, getting set to tap the market is Cooper Tire & Rubber Co, with a $200 million 30-year noncallable debt offering via Merrill Lynch & Co, sources said. Meanwhile, another $2.0 billion in high-yield debt offering are expected to hit the market as well, dealer added.   The B2/B-plus rated deal consists of $200 million in 10-year senior notes and $250 million (proceeds) of 10-year senior discount notes. Another $150 million is expected to come from Titan Wheel International. The offering is expected to include $150 million in B1/BB-minus rated senior subordinated notes due 2007 via Merrill Lynch & Co. Among private placement debt offerings, Borg-Warner Security Corp is expected to issue $125 million in 10-year 144A senior subordinated notes via Merrill Lynch & Co.   EV International is expected to set $100 million in 10-year 144A senior subordinated notes via Chase Securities. Key Plastics Inc is expected to bring $125 million in B3/B-minus rated 144A senior subordinated notes due 2007 via Lehman Brothers. Also, Prime Hospitality Corp is expected to tap the market with $200 million in B1/B-plus rated 144A senior subordinated notes due 2007 via Merrill Lynch & Co.

ECAT	The closure of the deal rescheduling Russia's commercial bank debt is not likely to take place until the first quarter of 1997, the Russian finance ministry said on Monday. "Due to the unprecedented volume of secondary market trading of eligible debt, the reconciliation process is taking longer than anticipated, and it is now expected that the closing of our London Club arrangements will tke place in the first quarter of 1997," it said in a statement.
GCAT	South Korea said on Wednesday it had failed to break a deadlock in talks with China over the fate of a senior North Korean defector stranded in Seoul's Beijing mission, despite signs that Pyongyang had softened its stance. Separately, South Korea's ruling party chairman said Seoul must re-think its unification policy towards the North. Lee Hong-koo of the New Korea Party said food shortages and economic woes were driving the North into a final crisis. He said the defection by top ideologue Hwang Jang-yop was pushing the North Korean leadership deeper into desperation. A Foreign Ministry spokesman denied a Japanese newspaper report that China and South Korea had agreed that Hwang, ranked 24th in Pyongyang's hierarchy, could leave Beijing for asylum in South Korea as early as this week. "Unfortunately, we have not made any real progress in our talks with China and it is too early to talk about when Hwang could leave Beijing," spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung told Reuters. Another Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to be identified, said: "He is not likely to leave within a few days. It could be weeks before Hwang can secure his departure." Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that Seoul and Beijing had "basically agreed to transfer Hwang" to South Korea. "The Yomiuri report is not true," the spokesman said. "Our talks with China are still at an initial stage." Hwang has taken refuge at the heavily-guarded South Korean consular office in Beijing for eight days. Foreign Ministry officials said Hwang's fate could be decided only between Seoul and Beijing, while China maintained it was desirable that Hwang's case be resolved through dialogue between North and South Korea. Signs have emerged that North Korea might be ready to give up the fight to recover Hwang, possibly as a result of mediation by Beijing to end the Cold War crisis in its backyard. The softer tone was first set when Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry said on Monday it would dismiss Hwang if he defected. Japan's economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported on Wednesday that Kim Jong-u, head of North Korea's Overseas Economic Cooperation Committee, told a meeting with financial officials in China that Pyongyang had already dismissed Hwang. The newspaper quoted sources at the meeting as saying that Kim Jong-u was asked if North Korea accepted Hwang's defection. He replied: "That is what the government has decided. The matter is already closed. He has already been dismissed." Lee from Seoul's ruling party said Hwang must be granted political asylum in South Korea as he wished, but urged the South Korean media and citizens to be cautious and patient. He said Pyongyang's woes would remain a headache for Seoul. Apart from Hwang, many other North Koreans who had fled the North were waiting to defect to South Korea, he said. "Severe food shortages and economic difficulties are driving the North Korean system to an irreversible final crisis," Lee told parliament. "In view of North Korea's rapid breaking away from its orbit and its plunge, we must drastically review our unification policy." Lee said Seoul's policy of seeking reunification of the Korean peninsula by treating the North as an equal partner might have to be abandoned. He did not elaborate but a senior New Korea Party official told Reuters the party chairman was stressing the need to brace South Korea for a possible collapse of the North. The two Koreas remain technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce and not a peace agreement.
CCAT	Finland's Fazer Group will invest 20 million zlotys this year to build two production lines in its Polish subsidiary and boost annual confectionary production to 28,000 tonnes, the head of Fazer Group said. Felix Bjorklund told a news conference on Thursday the Fazer Polska Sp.z.o., in the north town of Gdansk, produced 12,600 tonnes of confectionary products in 1995 and 1996. "This year we will invest 20 million in Poland to open two production lines. This will allow us to increase production to 28,000 tonnes annully," Bjorklund said. Fazer Polska now has about five percent of the Polish confectionary market. "Fazer Polska's main goal is to increase its market share in Poland and its exports to neighbouring countries. We want to be the biggest in the Baltic area," Bjorklund said. -- Ryszard Wesolowski +48 22 653 9700
GCAT	Ruthann Aron, a former Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate and a member of the Montgomery County planning board, was indicted by a grand jury Thursday on new charges that she tried to poison her husband. The grand jury also indicted Aron, 54, on two counts of soliticing someone to murder her husband and a Baltimore lawyer, a state prosecutor said. Aron, was arrested last month as part of an elaborate sting operation set up after an informant called police and said Aron wanted the name of a hit-man. The Montgomery County Council also passed a resolution removing Aron from the seat on the planning board she has held since 1992, council president Marilyn Praisner said.
MCAT	The Yugoslav central bank raised the interest rate on its short-term bonds sharply and halved the paper's maturity on Friday, the Belgrade bourse said. Bourse spokesman Milko Stimac said the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) offered 40 million dinars in 30-day bonds at 102.88 percent annual interest rate at Friday's auction. This compared with the previous 60.7 percent annual rate set when the NBY launched its first 60-day bonds in late June. Stimac told Reuters the bank sold bonds worth just over three million dinars at Friday's sale. One trader said a possible reason behind the sharp rise in the bond's interest rate and its truncated maturity was that the central bank had taken a jump in July inflation to 6.6 percent into account. "They (the bank) apparently now need more money and they have realised that low interest rates on longer-dated paper attract no investors," another trader said. No-one at the central bank was immediately available for comment. A market analyst said that the jump in the rate on NBY bonds could be followed by a rise in the discount rate, which has been unchanged at 4.5 percent since June. The central bank sets the discount rate each month using a basket that includes interest rates on the open money market, price rises, expected monetary developments, credit demand and money supply. The central bank vice-governor Ratko Banovic recently said the NBY would keep the discount rate as its key instrument in regulating market liquidity. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254

ECAT	An official from the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) characterized as steady the overall price picture in the manufacturing sector of the economy, depite a near four-point jump in manufacturing prices in September. Speaking to reporters in a teleconference after the NAPM released its monthly report on manufacturing, Ralph Kauffman said, "I would say it's fairly steady right now.  We are seeing some increases in some areas; a lot of them seem to be related to oil and natural gas input." Kauffman is chairman of the NAPM business survey committee.   As for growth in manufacturing, Kauffman said factory owners may wish to grow at a slightly more rapid pace, but he noted that they are aware of the risks of too much growth. "I think they might like a little bit more growth, but they are aware of problems that would come from too much growth," Kauffman said. Going forward, Kauffman said future indicators point to continued steady growth in manufacturing near term. "I think continued steady growth at approximately the level we've seen recently is probably indicated for the very near term," he added.   Steady growth near term would continue a trend that has been in place over the past six months. Kauffman said it would be fair to characterize manufacturing growth over the last half year as "steady." "Our index has kind of fluctuated a bit up and down, but all within the range indicating growth," he said. Turning to the backlog of orders index in September, Kauffman said that component hinted that production will not fall dramatically over the short haul. "I think what it (the backlog of orders index) says is that production is not going to drop drastically," he said. The NAPM's index slipped to 51.7 in September from 52.6 in August.  Prices were up almost four points to 51.2. -- N.A. Treasury Desk, 212-859-1660
ECAT	The Clinton administration, preparing for next week's presidential trip to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, is defending its trade record, but analysts warn that the United States is losing ground because it still lacks "fast track" authority for trade deals. "I think this administration's trade record in the first term has been a very strong one, including the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)," said President Bill  Clinton's special adviser for Latin America, Thomas McLarty. McLarty, a former White House chief-of-staff, also pointed to the 1994 Summit of the Americas Clinton hosted in Miami, where the 34 countries represented launched a project of forging a hemispheric free trade agreement by 2005. At that summit the three NAFTA partners, the United States, Mexico and Canada, offered Chile the chance to become the fourth member. The United States, however, has not been able to make good on that invitation because it lacks "fast track," a key authorisation from Congress to negotiate new trade deals. Treaties signed under that legislation cannot be amended by Congress, which must vote them up or down in a short time. U.S. analysts argue that the lack of "fast track" has kept the United States on the sidelines and strengthened the hand of Brazil, the leading voice in the MERCOSUR South American common market agreement. While NAFTA has not expanded since it started in 1994, MERCOSUR has struck deals with Chile and Bolivia and is in talks with other South American nations and the European Union. "If we drop the ball, the United States' credibility will be shattered," said Richard Feinberg, dean of the University of California at San Diego's Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies. "That will result not only in stalling integration but it will also affect all other areas of cooperation, because trade is the grease of this process," said Feinberg, who was Clinton's Latin America specialist in the National Security Council. C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics, noted that Brazil has always had a strong domestic constituency rooting for protectionism and economic dominance in South America. "If the United States falters," said Bergsten, "the paradoxical result of the summit of Miami will be the enhancement of Brazil's leadership." While the White House acknowledges that the stakes are high, it argues that having "fast track" at this point is not as crucial as it will be in October, when Clinton is due to visit Brazil and Argentina, Mercosur's main partners, and Venezuela. McLarty pointed out that Mexico already is in NAFTA and the third biggest U.S. trading partner, while Central American and Caribbean nations are more interested in the Caribbean Basin Initiative, a pact that grants preferences to their exports to the United States. Nevertheless, he said Clinton will be speaking frequently about the need to expand trade, hammering on the fact that the United States must hold natural markets like Latin America. In the meantime, his negotiators like U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky will continue to hold talks with the Republican majority in Congress to try to find common ground on "fast track" authority. "Our approach is to build a critical mass, a bipartisan consensus that will support 'fast track' legislation," McLarty said. "I hope we will be successful, I think we will be". Republicans, however, voiced doubts about the administration's intentions and wondered if Democratic presidential politics were not muddling the process. House of Representatives minority leader Richard Gephardt, a potential contender for the Democratic nomination together with Vice President Al Gore, has spoken against expanding NAFTA. Championing two key Democratic issues, the White House has long insisted on including the authority to negotiate labour and environmental issues in "fast track" legislation. Republicans said they now agree to include any trade-related issues, but complained that the administration still has not come forward with a proposal. Arizona Republican Representative Jim Kolbe, a leading free trade advocate, warned that the window of opportunity for approving "fast track" was growing narrower. "We can't expect to get 'fast track' this year if we don't get it by the August recess," Kolbe told reporters.
ECAT	A year after he was sacked, Argentina's former economy minister Domingo Cavallo said Sunday the country's economy has developed very much as he predicted. "The economy is going well, just as I had predicted would happen," Cavallo said in an interview with daily La Nacion. Asked if Argentina is converting itself into an Asian-style tiger economy of Latin America, Cavallo said: "Argentina already is, together with Chile, a kind of tiger." "If we look at the performance of the 1990s, growth is impressive, it is of the magnitude achieved by the Asian tigers in the 1960s and 1970s," he said. Cavallo predicted growth would probably reach eight percent this year. The former minister said there were still necessary changes required in the economy, such as labor market reforms to help bring down unemployment. Among policies still needed to reduce the jobless rate, Cavallo said more work was needed in sectors like health and education. He also stressed that policies are needed to support the growth of small and medium-sized companies, so that they in turn will create more jobs. All the same, he characterized his successor, Roque Fernandez, as "a good administrator". ((-- Axel Bugge, Buenos Aires Newsroom, 541 318-0668))
GCAT	The Mars rover rolled down a ramp from the Pathfinder space lander late on Saturday onto the surface of the "Red Planet", U.S. space officials said. The six-wheeled buggy-type vehicle named "Sojourner" was scheduled to begin exploring the surface of Mars on Sunday, analysing its rocks and soil for at least one week.   The successful deployment came after a day of suspense at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here where space officials had feared the scientific aspects of the $266-million mission might be hurt by a communications glitch. However, communications between the lander and Sojourner were later restored, allowing signals from mission control to get through to the rover's on-board computer. After a ramp was lowered, the rover was told to "stand-up" from its stowed position and once the wheel bogeys were locked in place, the tiny 22-pound (10 kg) vehicle -- looking like a workbench or microwave oven on wheels -- slowly moved down the 35-degree slope onto the Martian surface. Officials confirmed at 10.59 p.m. PDT (0559GMT Sunday) that the rover was on the planet's surface. During its exploration, the solar-powered rover will navigate with the aid of laser beams, will take 3-D photographs with its twin-lens camera and will be able to pick up and analyze samples of rocks and soil and transmit the data to Earth.

ECAT	Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said there were signs of strong growth in Japan's real economy. But Tietmeyer, speaking after a meeting of G10 central bank governors, said the bankers believed that most economies in continental Europe were still in a period of structural adjustment. Tietmeyer said the G10 central bank governors had however singled out the Netherlands as having an improving economy. "As far as Japan is concerned, first of all there are now in the real economy signs of strong growth," Tietmeyer said.   Tietmeyer said recent gross domestic product data for the first quarter in Japan had been "relatively strong," and the latest Tankan survey showed increasing confidence. "Of course, one has to wait and see what will be the future developments," Tietmeyer said, regarding Japan. Tietmeyer said the G10 central bankers also had a brief discussion about the economic situation in Europe. "On the one hand the situation in the Netherlands is improving, as you know," Tietmeyer said. "On the other hand, most countries in continental Europe are in a structural adjustment process," Tietmeyer added, without specifying which countries he was refering to. "For the time being, monetary policy has not to play a special additional or changing role in those countries," he said. Tietmeyer has in the past repeatedly said that central banks have done their share to revive continental European economies, and that it was now up to the governments to contribute to growth through measures like labour market liberalisation. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340

MCAT	The key June 10-year Japanese government bond futures contract ended slightly higher on Monday due to short-covering by dealers, traders said. "Traders showed little inclination to trade actively today," said a trader for a city bank's securities unit. The June rose slightly on short-covering by dealers prompted by the firmness of cash JGBs and also by the need for position adjustment, the trader said. The June ended at 126.91, up slightly from Friday's close of 126.85. Turnover was 17,862 contracts.   Traders said the market would be focusing on a 10-year JGB auction scheduled on Tuesday, and the possible launch of a straight bond by Tokyo Electric Power Co Inc (TEPCO) later this week. Traders said the coupon rate of the new issue of 10-year JGBs was likely to be set at a record low of 2.3 percent. There may be solid demand from investors despite the low coupon rate if the new issues are offered at under par, traders said. TEPCO is likely to launch about 150 billion yen to 200 billion yen worth of 10-year straight bonds, traders said.   The transition to a "T-plus-three" rolling settlement system, in which JGB transactions are settled three business days after the trade date, may be contributing somewhat to the firmness of cash JGBs, traders said. T-plus-three settlement went into effect starting with JGBs traded on Monday. JGB transactions were previously settled seven days after the trade date. The shorter settlement period may be making dealers reluctant to sell cash JGBs short and may be encouraging buy-backs of cash JGBs, the trader for a city bank's securities unit said.   The benchmark 182nd JGB yield stood at 2.145 percent as of 0648 GMT, down slightly from Friday's close of 2.155 percent. Comments by Bank of Japan governor Yasuo Matsushita during a speech opening a two-day meeting of BOJ branch managers on Monday were in line with his previous statements and had little effect on the market, traders said. Matushita said a temporary slowdown of the economy was inevitable due to the effects of fiscal tightening measures. But Matsushita said that, taking into account positive signs in production, incomes and spending, it was highly likely that the economic recovery would continue after this setback.   Taking into account such conditions in the economy, it was appropriate for the BOJ to maintain its present monetary policy, Matsushita said. "We will continue to carry out monetary policy putting emphasis on strengthening the basis for the economic recovery," he said. --Masayuki Kitano, Tokyo Treasury Desk +81-3-5473-3748

ECAT	Massachusetts on Wednesday said that tax revenues rose to $1.28 billion in September, which means the state is on target to hit its goal for the 1997 fiscal year. During this fiscal year, the state has collected $2.87 billion, about 2.6 percent more than last year, and the latest data for September marks a 1.1 percent increase above the year-ago period. "The monthly collections for September bring total reveneus for this fiscal year within the benchmark range," said Revenue Commissioner Mitchell Adams. In September, Massachusetts collected $674.1 million from income taxes, an increase of $47.7 million, and $443.6 million in witholding taxes, a $38.8 million rise. From sales and use taxes, the state gathered $223.9 million, up $24.6 million. And corporate tax collections rose $30.7 million to $159.8 million. --Joan Gralla, 212-859-1654

ECAT	The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report on Germany backs the Bonn government's economic and fiscal policies, Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said. Their remarks were contained in a joint statement. "Now, the structural and austerity measures that have already been decided must be steadily implemented, without the unnecessary delays sought by state and local governments. That is also the view of the OECD," the ministers said. The German government's view that an economic upturn will take hold this year and strengthen next year is affirmed by the OECD, despite small differences of interpretation, the statement said. The OECD shares the German government's view that more flexibility and deregulation of the labour market is needed to eliminate structural bottlenecks. The OECD projection of the German federal deficit being 3.4 percent of GDP for 1997 reflected only a small part of the austerity measures that have been decided by the government, the statement said. The OECD itself recognised this in its report. -- Terence Gallagher, Bonn newsroom, 49-228-2609750

GCAT	President Boris Yeltsin, pressing on with changes in Russia's powerful Security Council after sacking outspoken ex-soldier Alexander Lebed, named two new officials to the policy-making body on Tuesday. Itar-Tass news agency said Yeltsin, who is preparing for heart surgery, appointed businessman Boris Berezovsky and military commander Leonid Mayorov as deputies to Ivan Rybkin, Lebed's successor as council secretary. The presidential press service could not immediately confirm the appointments. Berezovsky, 50, is a controversial figure with business interests ranging from car dealerships to television. He sits on the board of the biggest state television channel and is also a mathematician. Mayorov, 41, has commanded troops in the northwest military region since 1992, Tass said. The Security Council, headed by Yeltsin, groups senior government ministers, including those of defence and the interior, and officials of the Federal Security Service (FSB), successor organisation of the Soviet-era KGB. Yeltsin sacked Lebed, a reserve general with his sights on the presidency, earlier this month for insubordination. Rybkin is a moderate communist with a proven track record of loyalty to the president.
ECAT	Thai central bank governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi said on Monday an economic austerity package proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could be painful but the government would try to ease its impact. "Economic stabilising measures will not always produce only positive results. They could have some impacts. We are tackling domestic problems and will try to minimise the impact," Chaiyawat told reporters.   He did not say how the government would minimise the impact of the austerity measures. Chaiyawat said the government and IMF officials have reached agreement on key basic points in the package, of which clearer details are expected to be finalised by early next week. Finance minister Thanong Bidaya told reporters earlier discussions were still going on with the IMF but the basic framework of a package would be presented and was expected to be approved by cabinet on Tuesday. Thanong would make a nationally-televised address on Tuesday night to explain the package. Asked how much in loans Thailand would seek from the IMF, Chaiyawat said: "If we managed (to) tackle our problems quickly, we will need less money which will partly include a standby credit that has no negative implication for the country." The governor said the package was designed to send a signal to the international community that Thailand has moved to boost market confidence and to stabilise its financial sector. He said talks with IMF officials in the past week had produced very satisfactory results. He did not elaborate. Neither he nor Thanong commented on reports that Japan would provide loans through the Export-Import Bank of Japan in cooperation with the IMF. Japanese government sources said on Monday that Tokyo would decide on a financial support package for Thailand within the next two weeks. The Japanese financial newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun said on Sunday the Exim bank and the IMF had put togeter an $8 billion emergency loan package for Thailand to boost the economy. -- Bangkok newsroom (662)-6520642

GCAT	Israel on Wednesday released a Jewish settler who had been detained without trial ahead of the Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank town of Hebron. Noam Federman, who lives in a fortified enclave in Hebron's heart with about 400 other Jewish settlers amid the town's 100,000 Palestinians, vowed on his release to continue to fight against Israel handing over land to Palestinians. "Detention did not break me," Federman, a leader of the outlawed anti-Arab Kach movement, told Israel's Itim news agency. "I am returning to Hebron...Detention did not change my opinion and I will continue to fight for the Land of Israel." Itim said Federman, who before his detention had vowed to bring thousands of Jews to Hebron to roam sections of the town set to come under Palestinian rule and thus thwart the redeployment, had been in detention for 2-1/2 months. Israel handed 80 percent of Hebron to Palestinian rule last week. It still controls the centre of town where the Jewish enclaves are located. Israel captured Hebron along with the rest of the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. The town, sacred to Moslems and Jews as the burial place of their forefather Abraham, has long been a flashpoint of violence between the sides. In one of the worst incidents, settler Baruch Goldstein in February 1994 massacred 29 Arabs at prayer in the town.

CCAT	Credit Lyonnais Belgium, a unit of France's Credit Lyonnais, said on Tuesday it would offer free current accounts to customers from February. "As of February we will have accounts for current transactions which will be totally free of charge," said Yves Delacollette, the bank's director of retail operations, told a news conference. Delacollette estimated that Belgium's leading banks charge their customers on average about 3,000 Belgian francs a year in transaction and management costs.   Delacollette said CLB would also send bank statements to its customers free of charge, once a week. The sole condition for a free bank account is that customers have at least 500,000 Belgian francs of savings or investments with CLB. The bank has 220,000 customers who have, on average, one million francs of savings or investments deposited at the bank. Delacollette said CLB hoped to open about 10,000 free bank accounts this year. "In theory we could have a much higher number but the inertia on current accounts is very high," he said. -- Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6810, Fax +32 2 230 7710
GCAT	An Indian court on Wednesday granted former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao legal protection against arrest in a seven-year-old criminal forgery case until October 14.   Delhi High Court Judge S.K. Mahajan said the pre-emptive, or anticipatory, bail would last until a lower court holds a hearing into the forgery case on October 14. Last week a court issued a warrant to arrest Rao in the case. The warrant was temporarily suspended pending Mahajan's decision on Rao's request for protection against arrest. Mahajan said Rao could apply for ordinary bail at the October 14 hearing, when he was scheduled to be formally charged with forgery and two other counts. The forgery case dates from 1989. Federal police have charged Rao and five others with using false documents to defame a rival politician. Rao, who quit as Congress leader last month, has not commented publicly on the case.
GCAT	Fewer Albanian protesters are marching each day in this southern town but demonstrators and local opposition leaders said they would press on despite fearing a police crackdown was imminent. Some 400 protesters marched along the destitute town's main street chanting "Down with the government" in a sixth day of demonstrations sparked by the collapse of dubious pyramid investment schemes. Security forces continued to keep a low profile. Some 40 uniformed policemen watched from the sidewalks, led by the town's police chief clad in a white trench coat. But locals said many civilians loitering on the streets were secret policemen or employed by the ruling Democratic Party, the focus of protesters' outrage after the collapse of investment funds. One middle-aged man wearing a black jacket was overheard to mutter to a bystander: "Why don't they give us the orders." State television showed pictures of the local leader of the key opposition Socialist, Petro Koci, as protesters carried him on their shoulders during Sunday's march. Authorities accused him of inciting the marches. "There is a lot of pressure on us," Koci told Reuters in an interview at his party headquarters. "We receive threatening phone calls by criminals who are supported by the Democrats." "We have to be very careful, especially in the evening it is difficult to go out. Sometimes (at night) we do not stay at our homes," he added. Assurances by local security forces that they would let protesters go ahead while calling on them to remain peaceful did little to quell widespread fear of imminent police action. "There is serious tension in this town, not only because of the police but because of some special groups organised by the Democratic Party. People are afraid of them," Koci said. "The presence of foreign media is a very important factor in preventing police violence. They are afraid of witnesses," he added. Protesters regularly cheer assembled foreign camera teams, waving into their lenses and pleading with them to broadcast their plight around the world. The 36-year-old Koci was arrested last month and detained for three days after an angry crowd set fire to the local town hall. He said he had been summoned to see the Fier police chief again on Monday but had declined the invitation. The local chairman of the country's ruling Democrats told Reuters last week his party had organised "special groups" to protect the protesters from "violent extremists". But demonstrators said threats were not enough to quell the month-long popular unrest which has posed the most serious challenge to President Sali Berisha's rule since he came to power five years ago. "We are determined to go all the way," said Agron, a man in his mid-twenties. "We won't give up before this government resigns."
CCAT	Germany's minister for aerospace added his voice on Tuesday to industrialists calling for France to privatise its national company, Aerospatiale, as part of much-needed industry consolidation. "We can't have a restructuring of European industry if we don't have something that is close to a privatisation process. I think this is very important," Norbert Lammert, parliamentary state secretrary at the Federal transport ministry and coordinator for German aerospace industry told reporters at the Paris air show. Aerospatiale is the French Airbus partner Executives at Airbus partners British Aerospace Plc (BAe) and Daimler-Benz Aerospace have used the air show to urge the privatisation of Aerospatiale, to help speed up the conversion of Airbus into a single corporate entity -- which is seen as a big step in consolidating European industry. Lammert said the French Socialist party had been hostile to privatisations in the recent parliamentary election campaign so he did not expect a sell-off "in the next few weeks". But he added, "I think there will be political support. We should also have political agreement to support the industrial process". The fourth Airbus partner is Casa of Spain, which is also state-owned.

MCAT	Early calls on CME lean hog futures ranged from 0.200 cent per lb lower to 0.100 higher while pork belly futures were expected to open steady to 0.200 cent lower, livestock analysts said. Some analysts look for pressure in hog futures following steady to lower cash hog indications and lower wholesale pork prices late last week. Packers should keep bids down in view of the drop in cutout values, they said. USDA reported pork cut-out values fell $0.59 to $0.66 per cwt on Friday. However, others look for a further upward correction as they see tighter hog supplies through the summer and likely stronger cash markets as packers compete for available supplies.   Pork belly futures could see some carryover support from futures gains posted on Friday but most analysts look for pressure linked to weaker cash belly price quotes on Friday. Continued tight storage supplies were seen as supportive but demand for cash bellies will have to improve to provide further buying incentives, sources said. USDA quoted fresh pork bellies in the $83 to $85 per cwt level for 14-16 lbs. ((Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725))

ECAT	Santander brokerage firm said on Friday it had raised its estimate of Mexican 1996 Gross Domestic Product growth to 4.5 percent from 4.2 percent.   Economists Enrique Ramirez and Hector Chavez said they also increased their third quarter GDP estimate to 7.4 percent growth from 5.9 percent. They said the change was mostly due to higher estimates for industrial production. "Given impressive growth in July and August industrial production, we have revised our third quarter estimate for the sector's output to 14.9 percent from 8.0 percent," they wrote in a report. "Given that we still believe the economic recovery will slow slightly in the final quarter of the year, we are maintaining our 4.7 percent fourth quarter GDP growth forecast," they said. -- David Luhnow, Mexico City newsroom +525 728-9565
GCAT	A Chilean human rights panel has uncovered a further 899 cases of people who died or disappeared during General Augusto Pinochet's rule, bringing the total to nearly 3,200, officials said on Thursday. The report was the final step in a six-year investigation into political repression under the military regime which ruled Chile with an iron grip from 1973 to 1990. "The most serious result of the deep and painful conflicts experienced by Chilean society in recent years was...human rights violations," said board president Alejandro Poblete who presented the report to President Eduardo Frei. The Reconciliation and Compensation Corporation said the new cases were in addition to the 2,298 victims named in an official 1990 investigation into human rights violations during Pinochet's government. The new figures bring the number of victims of political repression to 3,197, of whom 2,095 are known to have died and 1,102 are officially classified as "disappeared" -- meaning no trace of them has been found since they were abducted. Investigations into human rights violations have been a frequent source of friction between the country's civilian authorities and the powerful armed forces since Chile returned to democracy in 1990. Despite ceding power to civilians that year, Pinochet remains commander-in-chief of the army. Interior Minster Carlos Figueroa said the government was looking into setting up a permanent body to defend human rights and would set up a special unit to take up the search for the bodies of people who have disappeared. "The families of human rights violation victims can be reassured that they will continue to be helped in their search for the truth about their loved ones," said Figueroa. Most victims were left-wing opponents of Pinochet, many of whom were killed and tortured by the regime's feared security services. An amnesty law dictated by the armed forces in 1978 has meant that few cases have been tried with only a handful of military officers behind bars for human rights crimes. Pinochet, now 80, came to power in a bloody coup in September 1973 which overthrew Marxist President Salvador Allende. The lower house of Congress last week voted to create a national holiday, Day of the Disappeared and Detained People, to be celebrated on August 30 to commemorate those who died during the Pinochet years. The bill's fate will be decided in the Senate, where majority pro-military rightists have said they oppose it.
MCAT	MGE spring wheat futures ended mixed, with nearbys gaining on commercial buying tied to continuing transportation problems caused by winter weather in the northern U.S. Plains, traders said. Another blizzard hit the area Wednesday, making roads impassable and tying up grain movement, traders said. "They had interstates closed in North Dakota and Minnesota again. That's causing more problems. We're taking all our stocks out and we're not rebuilding them," one trader said. MGE spring wheat settled 1-1/2 cents per bushel lower to 3-1/2 cents higher, with March up 3-1/2 cents at $3.89-1/2. Commercial buying came from Continental, which bought 1.2 million March bushels, and from Cargill, which bought 700,000 March. General Mills and Bay State, which both have large milling interests, each bull-spread at least 400,000 March/May. Traders said the March/May spread was bid at 15-1/2 cents, premium March, at the open but traded as wide as 17 cents. The MGE estimated Wednesday's spring wheat futures volume at 13.9 million bushels, down from 17.6 million Tuesday. MGE barley futures closed unchanged to one cent per cwt lower, with March down one cent at $6.69. ((--Greg Frost, 816 561-8671))
CCAT	Two more companies may be interested in bidding for FoxMeyer Drug Co in an auction of its assets scheduled for November 6, a company official said on Friday. "One interested player has been in and we expect another one next week," Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Peiser told a meeting of creditors. A Reuter reporter also attending the meeting. The company, a unit of FoxMeyer Health Corp, filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors on August 27.

GCAT	Seven people have been shot dead in inter-clan fighting in South Africa's troubled KwaZulu-Natal province, homeland of the country's nine million Zulu people, police said on Monday. Four men aged between 40 and 60 were killed about midday on Sunday by a gang of men armed with AK-47 assault rifles in Nongoma, in the north of the province, police spokesman Vish Naidoo said. "Three people were shot dead and another was wounded this morning (Monday) in what we suspect is a revenge attack," he told Reuters. The Sunday killings occurred as President Nelson Mandela, making a speech in KwaZulu-Natal, repeated an appeal for peace in the region. "The motive for the attacks is believed to be related to the ongoing factional fighting in the area," Naidoo added.
GCAT	U.S. Open champion Ernie Els feels the world's top players have answered the challenge of Tiger Woods emphatically -- by winning golf tournaments. But the South African stressed that beating the sensational young American was not his particular aim in events where they both play. Just when it seemed he was in a bit of a slump, Woods confirmed his talent on Sunday by winning the Western Open near Chicago -- his seventh triumph in just 10 months as a professional. With the victory, he regained the top spot in the world rankings, with Greg Norman, Els and Colin Montgomerie right behind. "Yes we have responded," Els said on Tuesday, on the eve of the Loch Lomond World Invitational. "Just look at the last few weeks. I won the U.S. Open, Greg won in Memphis and on Sunday Colin won in Ireland," Els said. "But we must not get away from the fact that playing the game of golf is not just about beating Tiger Woods," he added hastily. "He's playing tremendous golf and he has one hell of a record already. But it is not us against Tiger or Tiger against us. "It's us playing the game and trying to put the best score on the board. At least that's the bottom line as far as I'm concerned. "My goal is to try and beat the golf course and the field, not just Tiger Woods," Els said. Norman answered the same question by saying he did not react to a good player but to good play. "When you get the best players playing together, a good player will always make another good player lift his game," Norman said. Woods is not playing at Loch Lomond this week but the other three right behind him in the rankings are, as is world number six Tom Lehman, the reigning British Open champion.

GCAT	Serbia plans talks with ethnic Albanians to calm tensions in the province of Kosovo which have been overshadowed by opposition demonstrations elsewhere in the republic, political sources say. The independent Belgrade newspaper Dnevni Telegraf said Serbian officials and Albanian leaders had discussed implementation of an education agreement in the Albanian-majority province which was signed in September 1 year but not put into effect. Serbian officials refused to deny or confirm the meeting would go ahead. But political sources in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, said the talks were expected to resume urgently despite the instability elsewhere in Serbia caused by the annulment of opposition victories in municipal elections. In 1989, Serbia abolished Kosovo's autonomous status, charging that its Albanians, outnumbering Serbs nine to one, were preparing to secede. Serbs regard Kosovo as the ancient cradle of their culture. Since 1989 the Albanians have been quietly dissenting in the impoverished, rocky southern region. They have peacefully boycotting Serbian authority and pushed for greater self-rule. A solution of the Kosovo problem was sidetracked for years by efforts to end the devastating war in Bosnia. When the Dayton peace treaty held in Bosnia, the spotlight moved back to Kosovo. "The international community has explicitly warned the Albanians that Yugoslavia's internal and external borders cannot be changed. This has helped us as well as them to shed their illusions," said Bosko Drobnjak, a senior Serb official. "However, an atmosphere for dialogue created last year was not welcomed by hardliners. This resulted in terrorism." Both Serbs and Albanians say that 15 Serbs and 14 Albanians were killed in clashes in Kosovo in 1996 -- more deaths by ethnic violence than in Bosnia's first postwar year. The latest target was the radical Serb rector of Pristina University, Radivoje Papovic, who opposed the education deal Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic struck last September with Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. The agreement, under which Albanian students would return to schools after boycotting them six years, was described as historic but never got off the ground because of delays blamed by each side on the other. "We welcomed the deal with profound relief. We believe it was the most delicate problem of all," Drobnjak told Reuters. "We favour a step-by-step approach to solving the dispute. We must abandon our entrenched positions and compromise. "But if all we keep hearing from the Albanians is "We want independent Kosovo' then all dialogue is senseless." "Albanians will never again at any cost accept living under Serbia's rule even if they get autonomy," said Blerim Shala, editor of the leading Albanian weekly Zeri. Albanian parties, Rugova's LDK and the Parliamentary Party (PP) led by Adem Demaqi who spent 28 years in old Yugoslavia's jails as a political prisoner, urge Kosovo's independence. Where Rugova advocates peaceful means to achieve his goal Demaqi wants to radicalise the drive for a break from Serbia. Paradoxally, Demaqi is more moderate in his final goal -- a Republic of Kosovo within Yugoslavia. But LDK vice-president Fehmni Agani told Reuters the LDK could accept a Kosovo republic as a compromise solution. Their hopes were boosted by the international High Representative in Bosnia, Carl Bildt, who urged Albanians' demands for their own republic within Yugoslavia to be met. But all agree that neither Milosevic nor the Albanians could put such a proposal forward. "It is the international community which must slap the deal down at the table like in Dayton," Shala said. Western diplomats say that by granting the Albanians their republic Milosevic would solve many of his problems with the Serbian opposition coalition Zajedno (Together) which has been protesting on the streets for 75 days against the election annulments. "This would allow Milosevic to become the president of a new Yugoslavia and amend the constitution, giving him greater powers which grateful Albanians would gladly endorse," a senior Western diplomat said. "This would also enable him to regain his standing in the international community which will forget the mess he made with Zajedno in one stroke."

MCAT	Jakarta stocks are expected to be steady on Tuesday following the unveiling on Monday of a fresh economic deregulation package which cut tariffs on 1,600 items and curbed loans to the property sector, brokers said. The measures would generally improve market sentiment as they aimed to increase the economy's efficiency, they said. Coordinating Minister for Economics, Finance and Supervisor of Development Saleh Afiff said the 1,600 items covered 1,461 manufactured products, 136 agricultural products and three items in the health sector.   "Sentiment on property sectors could be mixed following measures contained in the deregulation package," an analyst with Hongkong-based brokerage firm said. The analyst said the market needed time to digest the measures and their impact on property companies. "It seems that firms which have a big land bank will have competitive advantage over those who don't," he said. Brokers expected sentiment on Astra International to be firm on expectation that it will benefit from the deregulation package.   They said food manufacturer Indofood and confectionary Mayora would benefit from the government move to allow sugar producers to import raw sugar, dismantling the monopoly held by state commodities regulator BULOG. Plantatation firms Bakrie Sumatra and London Sumatra are also expected to get market attention following a revision of the export tax structure for palm oil and products under the deregulation package.

CCAT	The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) will vote next month whether to allow all customers to choose their electricity supplier as of 1998, or to retain the existing phase-in plan, a commissioner advisor said Tuesday. A draft proposal before the commission calls for abandoning plans to phase in open access over as many as five years in order to offset the market power of existing monopoly utilities. State legislation passed last year called for all California customers to be able to choose their electricity supplier no later than January 1, 2002. At a regular meeting on Tuesday the CPUC decided to hold the proposed decision until April 9, so that comments can be filed through March 21. The state's three major investor-owned utilities, Edison International's Southern California Edison Co, PG&E Corp's Pacific Gas & Electric Co, and Enova Corp's San Diego Gas & Electric Co have argued for the phase-in plan based on practical and commercial logistics. The CPUC is scheduled to vote on the change April 9. ((--D Beasley, Los Angeles bureau + 1 213 955 6761))
CCAT	British Airways World Cargo plans to increase its wet lease freighter service between Hong Kong and London to a daily frequency when the territory's new airport opens next year, the airline's area manager for Greater China, Chris Chan, has told Reuters. BA is also planning to step up its three times a week freighter link from Hong Kong to London Gatwick to four times weekly later this year, Chan said in an interview. It now operates Boeing 747-200 freighters wet leased from Atlas Air in addition to sizeable belly capacity aboard 14 Boeing 747-400 passenger flights a week to Heathrow. Wet leasing involves the supply of an aircraft with crew, fuel, supplies and supporting services. The proposed daily freighter service from Hong Kong could be switched to Heathrow where BA is building a new dedicated terminal provided suitable slots become available, Chan added. "We are hoping to start the fourth weekly frequency late this summer and a daily service from next year as we continue to expand. Three years ago we started with zero now we have three freighters a week with the prospect of more to come," Chan said.

GCAT	The European Commission said on Thursday it planned to propose legislation to reduce late payments on commercial transactions in the European Union. It said all EU governments should enforce minimum requirements, including a statutory right of creditors to interest on late payments. "Increasingly long payment periods have serious consequences for all European firms, whose cash-flow, profitability and competitiveness are undermined," the EU executive said in a statement. Only a limited number of EU countries took action following a 1995 Commission recommendation on the subject, it said. Small and medium-sized businesses were particularly hard hit, with deliberate delays hurting their competitive position as suppliers to large companies, it said. The Commission, which published a report on the question and asked for comments, cited a survey showing wide variations across the European Union in both contractually agreed credit periods and late payments. Contractual periods in 1996 averaged 19 days in Finland and 21 in Norway, but 75 days in Greece, 68 in Spain and 65 in Italy, it said. Average late periods ranged from six days in Norway and seven in Sweden and Denmark to 41 days in Portugal, 22 in Italy, 20 in Belgium and 19 in Greece, it added. "All efforts should be made to establish a climate in Europe where payments are made on time, and tackle the problems as a matter of urgency," EU Enterprise Policy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis said in the statement. Papoutsis said he would organise a hearing in October and propose legislation by the end of the year.

ECAT	Swiss M0 money supply grew at a rate of nearly seven percent on an annualised basis in May versus the fourth quarter of 1996, Swiss National Bank Chairman Hans Meyer said.   In May, the seasonally adjusted monetary base was nearly 4.5 percent above the target path set by the SNB, he said in the text of a speech at an SNB news conference. But he said the SNB's monetary policy was not as expansive as it appeared by viewing M0. Part of this was due to strong growth in large-denomination notes in circulation, which currently was around 700 million francs higher than what SNB models had projected. Meyer also said that sight deposits held by commercial banks at the SNB had expanded more strongly than expected and were around 400 million francs above the projected level.   In view of these deviations, there was some doubt as to the reliability of figures about the monetary base. "Monetary policy in any case is not as expansive as the strong growth in this aggregate seems to suggest. If it were to be adjusted to eliminate the expansion from these unexpected factors, then it would be roughly one percent above the medium-term target path," he said. The SNB targets growth in M0 of one percent per year over a five-year period. The current period extends to the end of 1999. -- Zurich newsroom +41 1 631 7340

MCAT	UK gilts could struggle to maintain the new highs reached late last week after a U.S.-inspired rally, with little of the upcoming week's domestic data likely to be supportive, analysts said on Monday. "Gilts are looking a little vulnerable and a chunky retail sales number on Wednesday could reverse their recent good performance," said Kevin Adams, gilts analyst at BZW. Analysts said the yield spread between 10-year gilts and U.S. T-notes of 100 basis points in particular looks unsustainable.   "That spread is as narrow as it has been for a while. Given the feeling now prevalent that the U.S. economy has slowed down of its own accord, that spread could push back out," Adams said. U.S. Treasuries forged ahead on Friday after a muted increase in retail sales activity and consumer prices in August eased fears of a near-term U.S. rate rise. U.S. bonds gained nearly two points and gilts a point. "Gilts were dragged up by the U.S. on Friday, but unless we get some good news of our own I can't see it lasting," said a gilts salesman. August PSBR data due on Tuesday offers most hope, he said.   "The market got a very good figure for July and is expecting something less favourable this time, but I think it may be pleasantly surprised." The consensus forecast suggests a borrowing requirement of 4.1 billion stg in August after July's repayment of 1.7 billion. But the rest of the week's data may underline the British economy's strength, especially in the consumer sector, and give gilts a rough ride. August retail sales data is forecast to show a 0.5 percent rise and a year-on-year rise of 3.5 percent compared with 2.2 percent in July.   And M4 figures due on Thursday are forecast to show broad money growth stuck stubbornly at 9.0 percent in August, the upper limit of the government's monitoring range. But BZW's Adams said the market may get some support from Europe even if the data and survey's show renewed economic strength. The German ifo survey due later this week will be a focal point. "Bond markets could react positively to a strong figure because of Germany needs to see stronger growth to ease its fiscal problems," said Adams.   The meeting this weekend between EU finance ministers in Dublin will help focus the markets' mind on the Maastricht convergence criteria for European monetary union. Among the issues addressed will be the stability pact on fiscal decifits and the possibility of automatic fines for divergent economies. Gilt futures clung to Friday's gains in early Monday trading, the December contract stood at 108-00. But the gilts salesman said if the future breaks above 108-00, he has a batch of sell orders to place in the market.   "There are a lot of investors seeking to move a bit shorter and 108-00 is the level they want to sell at," he said. The yield curve has been steady over the last week with only the five-year area cheapening slightly. But one trader at a GEMM said the best area remains 10-years. "That will avoid any problems at the short end if interest rate expectations radically alter after the retail sales data," he said. And the gilts market could be undermined further if the FTSE index of 100 leading shares continues to make new record highs. "There has been a lot of shifting out of gilts and into equities over the last three months and that shows no signs of abating," the salesman said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7715
ECAT	Following is a summary of the views on monetary policy of the six members of the UK Treasury panel of independent forecasters: KATE BARKER, CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY "During (the period) since 1992, there has still been a tendency towards conflict between the Chancellor (of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke) and Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George which has at times called into question the credibility of policy. The concern is that this would be more damaging when the economy moved into an above-trend period in which the inflation threat were more severe. Serious consideration should be given to moving towards greater independence for the Bank of England in the setting of interest rates. The CBI recommendations for this year's budget therefore include a slight tightening of fiscal policy, with tax reductions of at most one billion stg (and arguably nil, if the PSBR data does not show a clear improvement from the prior year), including some reduction in business taxation, as the personal sector is already in robust short-term health." She forecasts GDP growth of 3.1 percent in 1997 and a 3.5 percent increase in domestic demand, with RPIX falling to 2.4 percent.   PROFESSOR TIM CONGDON, LOMBARD STREET RESEARCH "The achievement (of medium-term financial stability) of the early and mid-1990s is in jeopardy. The economy is once again on the threshold of a business cycle which will lead to higher inflation in the late 1990s. The period of stability has come to an end. The right answer on the monetary front is to raise interest rates and to sell government debt exclusively at the long end (ie. away from the banking system).On the fiscal side, the PSBR should be reduced by tax increases and /or expenditure cuts. The monetary measures are far more important than the fiscal, as fiscal action has probably has little effect on national income except in the short run." He forecasts GDP growth of 4.2 percenrt in 1997 with domestic demand growing by 4.6 percent. RPIX will hit 2.5 percent in 1996 but edge up to 2.9 percent by 1998, he said.   GAVYN DAVIES, GOLDMAN SACHS "There is a prima facie case for tightening macro policy now. Ideally this should be done through fiscal policy, but it is not realistic in present political circumstances to expect a tightening greater than 0.4 percent of GDP built into the pre-budget baseline; indeed it is questionable whether even that can be delivered. Thus, the main burden may well fall on the monetary side. There must be a strong presumption that base rates will need to rise in the next 6-12 months, if not sooner. The eventual extent of the rise depends partly on timing, but is unlikely to be any less than the 150 basis points which successfully stabilised the inflation rate in 1994-95." Davies forecasts GDP growth of 3.4 percent in 1997 with domestic demand growing at 3.2 percent. RPIX will fall to 2.4 percent in 1997 and edge up to 2.6 percent in 1998.   PROFESSOR PATRICK MINFORD, LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY "All this talk (of rate rises) is entirely premature. Consumer spending is growing moderately well...the problem remains in manufacturing. The case for cutting interest rates now remains. If in due course the economy returns to rude growth, thoughts can then turn to raising them. But we are months if not years away from that situation. We should push tax rates as low as possible consistent with "sustainable' public finances: effectively public borrowing steady at about 2.0 percent of national income. That bald arithmetic implies taxes could in principle be cut by 12 billion stg. Given the uncertainties surround public spending plans (particularly those of a possible Labour government) any such figure is too large. However, it could reasonably underpin a rolling programme of planned tax cuts by this government, committed as it is to these spending plans. A 4.0 billion stg tax cut and a standard rate of 22 pence would be a sensible start to such a programme this year." Mindford forecasts GDP gowth of 3.1 percent in 1997 with domestic demand growing 2.9 percent. He forecasts RPIX at 2.0 percent in 1997 and 2.2 percent in 1998.   BRIDGET ROSEWELL, BUSINESS STRATEGIES LTD "We have incorporated into our baseline forecasts an increase in interest rates in the second quarter of 1997 of 0.25 percent (this is based on rates standing at 5.75 pecent) followed by further increases through the rest of the year leaving base rates at just over 7.0 percent by the end of 1997. This outome...is the sort we think appropriate. It seem to us not necessarily to be desirable to try and force inflation down below the current rates that we are forecasting in what is likely to be the fastest growth year in the current cycle and therefore one in which inflation is likely to be accelerating. We have assumed that the most likely outcome is that there will be tax cuts in this budget of around 2.5 billion stg, although in our view there is little justification for such cuts. This is especially the case in the area of consumer spending where growth is likely to be strong." She forecasts GDP growth of 3.3 percent in 1997 with domestic demand growing 3.6 percent. RPIX will fall to 2.4 percent in 1997 and edge up to 3.1 percent in 1998, she said.   MARTIN WEALE, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH "Our forecast shows a chance of about 45 percent that inflation will be 2.5 percent per year or less by the end of next year, and beyond that the situation is likely to deteriorate. It would be a pity to put up taxes and then find that they had to be reduced again. But the risk is the other way round. To leave taxes unchanged in the hope that the fiscal position can be corrected in other ways over the medium term can easily turn into an excuse for doing nothing about the budget deficit; this would let debt and interest payments increase, adding to the magnitude of the eventual adjustment. Provided interest rate policy is set with fiscal adjustment in mind, there is no reason why tax increases should lead to a slowdown in economic activity." He forecasts GDP growth of 3.4 percent in 1997 with domestic demand growing 3.4 percent. RPIX will be 2.7 percent in 1997 and edge up to 3.0 percent in 1998. -- Rosemary Bennett +44 171 542 7715
ECAT	The Bundesbank said on Wednesday that although German economic growth had paused in late 1996, this was not a change in trend and conditions for continued growth appeared good. In its February monthly report the German central bank said structural reform was now needed to give the economy a boost. Proposed reforms to the German tax system were a step in the right direction but had to be implemented quickly. The bank rejected suggestions that it could itself take more action to stimulate the economy. A more economy-oriented policy would hurt the central bank's credibility, unsettle markets and leave structural problems unresolved, it said. "The stimulus within the German economy did not continue towards the end of 1996," the Bundesbank said in its economic review of the winter months. "However the calming in economic activity is not to be seen as the same thing as a change in the trend," it added. Noting that the demand and production patterns seen could at first glance appear similar to the economic weakness which took hold in the second half of 1995, the central bank said that this was not the case as general conditions were much improved. "On a closer look it becomes clear that the important economic environment has improved considerably since then," the report said. "This is particularly true for exchange rates, wage agreements and for interest rates, which are now at a historically low level. This gives justification for the expectation of an acceleration in growth in 1997." The central bank welcomed government steps to improve the competitiveness of German companies through tax reform and reform of welfare payment systems and urged Bonn to implement such reforms quickly to help stimulate investment. Noting that investment was the weakest element in the current economic upturn, the Bundesbank said, "The early creation of certainty (on reform) could help considerably to increase the willingness of companies to invest and thus to create new jobs." It added that any such changes would of course take some time to feed through into the labour market. The German central bank noted that the current historical lows in capital market rates had raised the risk of volatility on bond markets, as developments since the end of last year had shown. "In this environment it is important not to allow any doubt to arise as to the firm stability orientation of monetary policy and as to the lasting consolidation of state budgets ... so as not to provide a floor for speculative exaggerations" the centr al bank said. The Bundesbank also noted that a more reactive monetary policy, as had been urged upon it as a means of combating unemployment and weak spending, "could on the other hand easily prove itself counter-productive because it could lead to loss of credibil ity and higher capital market rates." "Quite apart from that, the current economic problems in Germany, which are overwhelmingly structural in origin, can only be solved by economic and political reforms and not with a policy of cheap money," the report concluded.
CCAT	StaffMark Inc said it is acquiring Baker Street Group, a professional staffing company based in Houston in a merger deal. Terms of the transaction, which will be accounted for as a pooling of interests, were not disclosed. Baker Street Group, with 1996 revenues of approximately $11 million, is its thirteenth acquisition, StaffMark said.   StaffMark, a staffing services company with more than 160 offices in 20 states, Canada, and the United Kingdom, said its latest acquisition will have a positive impact on its earnings per share for 1997. StaffMark, which went public in the last week of September 1966, was up 1-3/8 to 24-7/8, a new high, in midday trading on the Nasdaq.

ECAT	Hong Kong's economy is expected to grow  at a healthy clip into 1998, with any negative impact from measures  taken by the post-handover government to cool the property market  likely to be modest, analysts said. "The property market will definitely have an impact on consumption,  and this year the economy has been mainly driven by the domestic sector,"  said George Leung, economic adviser to Hongkong Bank. But the impact  should be mild, he said. Economists polled by Reuters on average expected the territory's gross  domestic product (GDP) to increase by 5.64 percent in 1997 and 5.57  percent in 1998. Consumer prices were expected to rise 6.59 percent  this year and 7.0 percent next year. The forecasts compare with GDP growth of 4.7 percent for all of 1996,  and inflation of 6.0 percent the same year. Hongkong Bank said in a report issued on Thursday that while both  investment and consumer spending were expected to expand strongly  in the second half of the year, growth may be slower than in the first  quarter due to a cooling off in the property market. In its report, Hongkong Bank raised its forecast for 1997 GDP growth  to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent, based on a better-than-expected performance  in the first quarter driven by strong domestic demand. It trimmed its inflation forecast to 6.4 percent from 6.8 percent,  owing to a sharp drop in food prices in the first half of the year. Economists have estimated first quarter growth of about six percent.  Government figures will be released on Monday. "Spending is going to remain on an uptrend with moderating inflation  and rising real income and that is going to offset the external drag  from the trade deficit," said Chi Lo, regional economist at Deutsche  Morgan Grenfell (Singapore). In his first policy address following the July 1 handover, Hong Kong  Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa announced plans to boost housing supply  as a way to moderate real estate price rises and make homes more affordable. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule on July 1 after more than 150 years  of British colonial rule. Economists said that as long as the government used supply-boosting  rather than demand-crimping measures to deal with the housing problem,  the effect on growth should be slight. "We expect the government to pursue increasing supply as the main  measure for curbing the market rather than using any tax measures,"  said DMG's Lo. As a result, "the underlying trend for asset markets in Hong Kong  which include the property and the stock markets, is still up, and  that goes into our baseline assumption for GDP growth," he said. Ken Chan, senior economist at Nikko Securities, said a modest decline  in property values would be welcomed. "If the decline is limited to 10-15 percent it is kind of healthy  so you wouldn't expect a negative impact on next year's growth," he  said. The economist said Nikko has forecast slightly lower growth  in 1998 because of an expected decline in private consumption. HSBC's Leung said that barring the adoption of any draconian measures  to curb speculation, he expected property prices to rise again next  year, though by a smaller magnitude than in 1997. Property values had risen 30 percent during the first half of 1997. Leung said his forecast of 5.3 to 5.7 percent growth next year assumed  that the government will stick with a long-term policy of increasing  housing supply. "If we see a lot of drastic moves in October, then the forecast would  be another story," he said. Chief Executive Tung will deliver an address  to the legislature in October, when he is expected to elaborate on  his housing goals. The economists also said they expected the Hong Kong dollar to be  little changed at end-1997, despite recent volatility in the wake  of currency instability in the rest of Asia.
GCAT	Cyclone Gretelle uprooted trees and cut power lines on Tuesday in the Mozambican capital Maputo as it passed close to the country's Indian Ocean shores. Powerful winds reaching 56 km/hour hit the southernmost Maputo and Gaza provinces, the National Meteorological Institute reported. In the capital gale-force winds brought down trees in the streets and caused power cuts, but there were no reports of injuries or large-scale crop losses. The institute cautioned however that wind speed could rise to 76 km/hour later in the day. "Precautionary measures should be taken," the institute said in its warning. Cyclone Gretelle has reportedly left more than 30,000 people homeless and more than 100 dead or missing in Madagascar, west of Mozambique, and has been labelled the worst there in living memory. South African weather forecasters warned on Monday that the cyclone would cause heavy rains and high seas along the southern African coast.

MCAT	U.S. millfeed prices were mostly steady to lower, pressured by bountiful supplies of newly-harvested soft red winter and hard red winter wheat for milling, millfeed dealers said. Carolina sources said soft red winter wheat was locally priced 10 to 15 cents per bushel less than corn, plus high quality of this year's wheat made it an attractive feed ingredient. USDA on Friday estimated the U.S. winter wheat crop at 1.78 billion bushels, up 20 percent from a year ago.   Grain dealers said both the hard red winter and soft red winter wheat harvests were producing grain with high test weights, low moisture and very little disease. Much of the harvested wheat was going to flour mills rather than to export. Also, many mills were running through the weekend in some areas, dealers said. ((Chicago newsdesk 312-408-8720))

CCAT	Operating profits at Japan's 10 biggest commercial banks are expected to fall in the current financial year, partly due to lower profits from bond sales, the chairman of the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan said on Tuesday. The 1996/97 financial year ends in March. Shunsaku Hashimoto, who is also president of Sakura Bank Ltd, one of the nation's biggest banks, told reporters that plans to separate the Finance Ministry's inspection and supervisory functions seemed to be gaining support. Japanese politicians are currently working on bills to reform the Finance Ministry, which has been criticised for its lax handling of the banking industry.   Hashimoto said the Finance Ministry's planning and supervisory functions are different from the inspection function. "If inspection is to be separated (from the supervisory function), it is important to consider how to maintain closer relations between the inspection function and the planning and supervisory functions," he said. Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said earlier this month that the government would aim to have its bills on ministry reforms pass through parliament at the next regular session, which begins in January. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic and Sakigake parties have agreed to spin off the supervisory function of the Finance Ministry into an independent body. A ministry source said recently that MOF wants a bank inspection body that is semi-independent and not totally outside its jurisdiction. On the banks' forecast earnings, Hashimoto said: "When we see the commercial banks' earnings on an annual basis, operating profits are expected to be lower (for 1996/97) from a year earlier because of a decline in profits from bond sales and (low) interest rates."   Last Friday, the 10 biggest commercial banks announced their interim earnings. Their combined operating profits -- pre-tax profits from banking business -- fell 36 percent from a year earlier to 1.19 trillion yen in the first half of 1996/97.
ECAT	Albania said on Tuesday it wanted to meet donors and international investors as soon as possible in a bid to kick-start an economy throttled by months of anarchy. Finance Minister Arben Malaj said he had had recent meetings with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. "We have it confirmed from Italy that it will invite donors, possible donors and others to an international conference," he said at the annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London. He did not specify the likely timing of the meeting. An Italian-led multinational force, 6,000 strong, began deploying in Albania on Tuesday to protect aid convoys to the impoverished country. About 300 people have died in months of violence since the collapse of the get-rich-quick pyramid schemes which wiped out the life savings of many ordinary people. But Malaj said there were signs that normal civic life was returning to the country. "Soon Albania will be an attractive country for investors," Malaj said. The government would give priority to encouraging foreign investment in the oil and gas sector, chromium mining, tourism, textiles, agriculture and infrastructure, Malaj said. While a sharp slowdown in the economy as a result of the fighting meant financial compensation to foreign investors in the country was not possible, the government was hoping to pass a law soon which would allow the import of plant and equipment free of duty and tax. Weeks of looting and violence have led to widespread damage to buildings and businesses in the country and the breakdown of government authority. Private foreign investment had reached $95 million by the end of last year from $45 million three years earlier, Malaj said, adding that the country had enjoyed good support from international investors since the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The EBRD, set up in 1991 to assist central and eastern Europe in the transition to market economies, said the projects it had been supporting in Albania before violence erupted had been carefully chosen and had not suffered unduly to date. "They have not been fundamentally interrupted either physically or in terms of cashflow," said Olivier Descamps, the Bank's representative for Albania. He said the international financial community wanted to start negotiations involving the IMF, World Bank, the European Union and Italy and Greece as soon as law and order had been restored in Albania. "The aim is to stabilise the economic situation and gather bilateral grant money for the short-term needs of the Albanian people. They will then need aid and rebuilding money, a Bosnia-type effort," Descamps said. Malaj said the EBRD was backing eight projects in Albania, three in the state sector and five in the private sector.

GCAT	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday rejected criticism of his suspension from peace talks of an army general who met opposition leaders behind the government's back. The Defence Ministry on Friday suspended Major-General Oren Shahor as head of the Israeli team in talks on civilian issues with the Palestinians until an investigation is completed. In his first public comment on the affair, Netanyahu said: "We are talking about an officer -- I think this is a unique situation -- who was making contacts with the heads of parties secretly." In the remarks broadcast by Israel Radio, Netanyahu said Shahor had failed to report to "those authorised" at a time of sensitive negotiations when protecting information was vital to their success. Netanyahu said the parliamentary opposition, which reacted harshly to the suspension, had a right to be updated by himself or via other suitable channels. "But here we have a different situation," he said. Shahor drew political fire after an Israeli newspaper published a photo on Thursday showing him leaving the home of former Labour Prime Minister Shimon Peres and said he also had met former Labour cabinet minister Yossi Beilin. The officer had been a peace negotiator under Peres. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators discussing civilian issues related to implementing Israel's long-delayed troop withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron have said they have nearly wrapped up a deal. The sides still differ over security arrangements in the town, home to 100,000 Arabs and 400 Jews.

MCAT	Nov 19 - U.S. stock index futures closed higher and near new all-time highs set late in the session in S&P 500 and Value Line index futures. Strength in cash stocks, which also rose to new highs late, linked in part to firm bonds, fueled the late rise in index futures, traders said. They also noted some index arb activity in S&Ps as premiums widened on the rise. -Derivatives Desk(312)408-8750/E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com   Premiums widened on the afternoon advance in index futures, with at least three light arbitrage buy programs triggered in the December S&P 500 contract when the premium over the spot index widened over 3.40 to 3.60 points, traders said. Futures had slipped in early afternoon dealings when the bond market fell on the weak auction results, traders noted. However, the S&P 500 contract managed to stay above technical support which they pegged at about 737.00 in the Decmeber contract.

ECAT	Shanghai wants to create 10 to 15 new Sino-foreign joint ventures a year to help rebuild its light-industry sector, one of the backbones of the city's economy, the China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday. The newspaper said new projects in the city this year would include a $28-million-beverage factory and a $20-million-cosmetics factory. It gave no details. "From now on, we will launch 10 to 15 big joint ventures every year to expand production," the newpaper quoted Han Ruyuan, director of the Investment Section of the Shanghai Light Industry Holding Company, as saying.

GCAT	Iranian-sponsored peace talks between Uganda and Sudan hit a deadlock on Saturday when the two African countries failed to agree on a joint statement. "The talks have failed but they have not completely failed. There is still room for negotiations," said Eriya Kategaya, Uganda's foreign minister and deputy prime minister. He said Sudan refused to include in the statement a clause about Ugandan schoolchildren allegedly abducted in February by the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and held at a camp at Arnu in southern Sudan. "Our main concern was the violation of human rights especially the abduction of the 26 girls from the St Mary's College Aboke who are being held in Arnu," Kategaya added. Doubts about the success of the talks now in their ninth round surfaced at their outset on Friday after Sudan sent only its first undersecretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Kampala talks. There was no comment from the Sudanese representative. Relations between the two countries are strained over accusations that Sudan is helping the rebel LRA in northern Uganda and that Uganda is supporting the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in southern Sudan. Uganda denied on Monday accusations by Khartoum that it had attacked two southern Sudanese border towns in support of the SPLA rebels fighting the Sudanese government. Kampala accused Sudanese government warplanes of bombing northern Uganda in February but Khartoum denied doing so. Uganda asked Iran to mediate last year when President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani visited Kampala. Iran mediated an agreement between the two countries last September under which Uganda and Sudan agreed to resume diplomatic relations severed in April 1995 after an incident in which Sudanese diplomats refused to surrender a cache of weapons to Ugandan soldiers.

GCAT	Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov on Wednesday formally asked Union of Democratic Forces leader Ivan Kostov to form a government, following his coalition's victory in the April 19 parliamentary elections. Kostov, elected on a promise to reform the economy and fight organised crime, said he expected to present his cabinet to Stoyanov on Monday, though the draft list is already known. "Happily the majority of the economic team remains, although modelled in a different way, but it will continue its work so that there will be no problem especially in the economic sphere," Kostov said. He said the ministers would use the time until next week to work on their programmes for the next four years. Muravei Radev, former deputy chairman of the economic committee in the previous parliament, is expected to be the new finance minister, while interim deputy prime minister Alexander Bozhkov is expected to retain the industry portfolio, overseeing the restructuring of the unwieldy state sector. UDF spokeswoman Nadezhda Mihailova is expected to become foreign minister, and interim interior minister Bogomil Bonev will continue his high-profile campaign against organised crime and corruption. Kostov will create a ministry of state administration to oversee reforms promised to reduce bureaucracy and improve the flow of information. The energy ministry will be downgraded to a committee. Parliament is expected to approve the new government on Wednesday. "We will present the programme, we will seek the support of parliament, and with this Bulgaria's political crisis which started on December 21 will probably end well for all of us," Kostov said. One of the first tasks of the new government will be to introduce a currency board, a restrictive fixed exchange rate mechanism intended to improve monetary discipline and stabilise the national currency. An International Monetary Fund mission arrived in Sofia on Tuesday to finalise details of the currency board and the 1997 budget, which has been delayed by the political upheaval. Elections were held 20 months ahead of schedule after mass protests forced out the former Socialist government in February. An interim cabinet led by Sofia's popular UDF mayor Stefan Sofianski has governed since then, tackling bread and fuel shortages and bringing inflation under control.
MCAT	Russian shares rose in healthy volumes on Thursday but traders said leading shares would be stable on Friday as some investors switched their attention to less liquid undervalued stocks. The Russian Trading System 22-share index rose to 357.00 after 349.75 on Wednesday. Total market volume was a vigorous $51.7 million and many shares were at near-record levels. "I expect there will be sideways movements and perhaps weakness during the day but overall stable (tomorrow)," said Renaissance Capital trader Vladimir Chkikvadze. National power utility UES rose to $0.3056 from $0.2999 on Wednesday but off an early high of $0.3100. Regional power company Mosenergo eased to $1.348 from $1.350. Norilsk Nickel metals group rose about six percent to $6.35 from $5.97 on Wednesday. CSFB chief trader Igor Rozhkov said money which started coming in over the last two weeks was still making itself felt, although others said investors were transferring their interest to less liquid stocks which trade on the RTS-2. The RTS-2 is for less well known shares and sees far lower volumes than the main RTS. Operators said "energos", or regional power utilities, and heavy construction were doing best. "They are the definite outperformers of the market -- the price action there is just wild," said a trader with a Western bank. "People are looking for value, looking for laggers." Gazprom ADRs shot up two marks on the Berlin Stock Exchange to marks 29.20 at GMT 1530 from Wednesday's closing 27.10 after Gazprom said it would protect its plan for separate foreign and domestic share markets. Underlying Gazprom shares closed almost unchanged at $0.6439 after $0.6415. One trader said the Russian market could be in for a jolt next week if the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates at its May 20 meeting. "If they do come out of the blue and raise rates the market will be hit hard," said the trader at a Western bank. "The market is overly bullish and it will hit us hard." --Christina Ling, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520

MCAT	U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets Monday were quiet, with no reported trades, feedlot sources said. Bids were light at $66.00 per cwt and passed by owners asking $69.00 for cattle, they said. Packers reportedly were comfortably supplied with live inventory to get through this week and probably would not be in the market until Wednesday or Thursday, the sources said. Firm beef prices were expected to underpin fed cattle prices once they do start trading again, several feedlot managers said.   Prices were seen $68.00, or higher, if beef prices and CME live cattle futures remain firm, the managers said. Showlists were mostly sold out last week, which also could lend support as feedlots remain extremely current in their marketings, they said. Showlists this week in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area were estimated near 95,500 head, down 4,500 from last week, market sources said.

Funds pick the stock in early session **  Calcutta operators square positions on last day --   Bombay shares finished higher on fund purchases in index-linked stocks and aided by a technical correction, traders said. They said hectic bids in shares of India's largest commercial bank State Bank of India and truckmaker TELCO drove prices to end higher and cheered the mood. Last week, the BSE index slumped 160.70 points or some five percent to 3347.37 after the government failed to deliver anticipated tax reliefs. The Bombay bourse was shut on Monday and Tuesday for Hindu festivals.   Traders said foreign funds were large buyers in SBI shares in the early session. SBI shares have fallen more than 13 percent on the BSE and NSE in the last two months. They said operators in Bombay were building long positions ahead of SBI's $400 million GDR issue pricing next month. "Some funds who missed out at the lower levels stepped in at 250/55 rupee levels but then speculators jumped on the bandwagon and the price shot up," said a trader at a foreign brokerage. Shares of truckmaker TELCO jumped 28.25 rupees or 6.2 percent to 480.75 on the BSE and shot up 29.90 rupees or 6.6 percent on the NSE on news of higher August sales.   Traders said newspaper reports of a slowdown in TELCO's vehicle sales were likely to be proved incorrect when India's monthly auto figures are released later this month. They said TELCO was likely to see a 19 percent growth in August sales from the year ago.

GCAT	Archaeologists in the Gulf Arab emirate of Ras al-Khaimah have discovered what they believe is the largest ancient tomb found in the Arabian peninsula, newspapers reported on Monday. The circular tomb is said to be 4,300 years old and contemporary with the pyramids of Egypt. It would have stood about three metres (10 feet) tall and 14.3 metres (46.9 feet) in diameter, they said. The tomb showed the ability of the area's ancient craftsmen to select and cut high-quality limestone blocks into a perfect circle, they added. "It is difficult for modern masons equipped with 20th century machinery to achieve the results I have seen in this building," Derek Kennet, resident archaeologist at the emirate's national museum, was quoted as saying.

ECAT	Asia and Europe can find common ground in business priorities but must continue to open markets and work to understand each other politically and culturally, speakers told a World Economic Forum meeting on Tuesday. "Perhaps the most important barrier to the realisation of an Asia-Europe community remains cultural and psychological," Amnuay Viravan, Thailand's deputy prime minister, told a plenary session of the Europe/East Asia Economic Summit. "Does the wider European public appreciate the norms and differences in Asian cultures in the way that many Asians have become familiar with European customs and norms?" The European understanding of convergence had nothing to do with the imposition of a single system or the domination of one nation by another, Austria's economics minister Johann Farnleitner said. "What we see as the main topic of convergence is financial discipline and stability but under equal market access rules," he said. Amnuay said the two regions risked becoming distracted from their courtship by regional issues such as economic and monetary union in Europe, or "locked into opposing positions" before the fledgling Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) had time to develop. He said he would like progress to come from a "regional basis" instead of between individual countries. "We are entering a new era of globalisation and certainly we want to be competitive, with cooperation from our partners," he told Reuters after the session. "I think the real success of the first ASEM was to recognise the importance of open regionalism." Christopher Roberts, Britain's deputy secretary of trade and industry, told the delegates that European and Asian businesspeople shared the same needs but said convergence was a "global phenomenon" not limited to the two regions. He said the two regions had made progress towards common understanding since the first ASEM summit in Bangkok in March which brought together heads of 15 European states and Japan, China, South Korea, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Indonesia's investment minister Santoyo Sastrowardoyo said only 12.8 percent of the country's accumulated foreign direct investment comes from the European Union, adding that European countries could be doing a better job compared to Asians. "Their decision-making processes are very, very conservative," he said. "Sometimes, many times, they are left behind and miss the train." The solution, Santoyo said, was to conduct business with equality, make decisions faster and find the optimum combination of competitive advantages. Business still faced barriers to entry despite advances made at the Uruguay Round of trade talks, Peter McGauran, Australia's science and technology minister, told the session. He told Reuters after the session that governments should promote trade and open markets by bringing business groups together. "We think the worst thing you could do was have politicians and bureaucrats deciding what the priorities are," he said. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852)2843-6441
MCAT	The interbank deposit rates fell in thin trade on the money market in line with a main interest rate cut which came into force on Monday, dealers said. "Banks prefer to regulate their liquidity by selling treasury paper directly instead of bidding for funds on the interbank deposit market," said dealer. Traders said that banks' liquidity was high which reflected in low demand for government securities on the secondary market. The central bank cut its simple annual main rate to 6.96 percent from 9.76 percent, effective from July 14. Prime minister Ivan Kostov said in a state radio interview on Monday that the falling lev rates showed the currency board system was working and urged banks to lend credits to enterprising businessmen. Banks' liquidity improved after a currency board launch on July 1 after they sold marks purchased earlier at lower rates. The central bank was buying marks 995 levs and selling at 1,000 after a fixed exchange rate of 1,000 levs per mark was introduced. Overnight interbank depo rates eased to 3.0-4.0 percent annually from 4.0-4.5 percent on Friday. Spot week rates were around 4.5-5.0 percent against 5.0-5.5 percent. The average annual interbank deposit rate was 4.80 percent on Friday against 4.83 percent on Thursday, a central bank official said. -- Dessislava Popova, Sofia Newsroom +359-2 981 4145

ECAT	By Thomas Roehm, Economist at the Ifo economic research institute in Munich The upward trend in the global economy is continuing. This was demonstrated by the Economic Survey International (ESI) of about 450 economists in 67 countries carried out by the Ifo institute for economic research in April. The economic climate continues to be favourable and the current economic situation and prospects for the next six months were positively evaluated in most countries. The economic development in the first quarter of 1997 was better than expected, particularly in the USA and Britain. In Japan, too, where the mood at the beginning of the year threw up doubts as to the permanence of the economic recovery, the evaluation of the current economic situation was better. The development in continental Europe was disappointing, where low interest rates and competitive exchange rates suggested a quick recovery as early as the beginning of the year. A slight decline is expected in the USA in the second and third quarters of 1997, as the majority of companies are working close to their capacity limits and further interest rate rises are expected. In total though, the real GDP growth rate should reach a level of 2.7 percent, slightly above the previous year's rate of 2.4 percent. In Britain, the brisker capital goods demand - compared to the first quarter - should ensure the continuation of high growth for the coming half year. Of the other western European countries, the northern lights -- Ireland, Finland and Norway in particular -- continue to have favorable growth prospects and in these countries the GDP growth rate for the whole year should lie well above the western European average of 2.3 percent. The economic situation in France, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany is still unsatisfactory. Hopes for an improvement in the next six months in Germany, Italy and Switzerland rely on a strong increase in exports. As, according to the experts asked, the dollar is going to remain strong, the prospects for this are favourable. With growth rates of around 2.3 percent, the upturn in most western European countries compared to the previous year should be consolidated. The only exception is Switzerland, whose economy is likely to stagnate this year following a decline of 0.7 percent in the previous year. The majority of Asian countries are also increasingly reliant on experts. This is particularly the case for Japan, where weak private consumer demand (among other things, V.A.T. was increased in Spring) is dampening growth, but also for most of the emerging economies. Last year, several of these countries experienced cuts in growth due to the declining export demand from industrial countries. In addition, in countries like Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia domestic demand was reduced due to restrictive financial policy intended to combat signs of overheating. Now, the majority of countries are regaining their self-confidence (Korea is the only country where an improvement is not expected in the next few months). The economic climate in India has significantly improved since the beginning of the year. The Asian countries have the most favourable growth forecasts for 1997 worldwide. On average, a GDP increase of 5.2 percent is expected in Asia. In China, GDP is expected to expand strongly, provisionally by almost 10 percent. Stable prices complete the picture of the Chinese economy's "soft landing", annual inflation for 1997 should be about 6 percent like in the previous year. In Latin America as well the growth prospects have significantly improved. The economy expanded more strongly than expected in 1996. After the peso crisis in Mexico and Argentina in 1995 had caused a severe slump and pessimistic expectations, the economy in both countries was able to grow strongly again in 1996 (5.1 and 4.4 percent). While GDP growth in Mexico may decline slightly in 1997 (4.7 percent), the Argentinian economy is expected to continue to grow (5.4 percent). Venezuela should experience a recovery in 1997, the expected rate of GDP growth is, like in Brazil, significantly over 3 percent. The economic development in the central and eastern European countries remains moderate. Of the countries more advanced in transition, probably only Poland (over 5 percent growth) and the Czech Republic (around 4 percent) will be able to sustain fast economic growth. The forecasts for the Slovak Republic for 1997 at 3.3 percent growth are still significantly lower than in the previous year (GDP increased by 7 percent in 1996). A slight revival is apparent in Hungary at the moment, but a growth rate of just 2 percent is expected for the whole year. The economic development in the Baltic states continues to be steady with growth rates of 3 percent. In contrast, economic performance in Russia in 1997 is expected to fall off slightly. The situation on the financial and currency markets is still characterised by price level stability and low interest rates as well as generally favourably economic prospects. Now that the leading interest rates have been raised in Britain and then in the USA, higher interest rates are to be expected in most other industrial nations. The long-term interest rates which up until the beginning of 1997 were mostly falling, have since then started to rise again slightly in many industrialised countries. While in the USA this development was caused by growing fear of inflation, in Europe uncertainties connected with the European Monetary Union played a part. On the foreign exchange markets the strong dollar will almost certainly be able to assert itself for the time being. The experts asked increasingly classified the British pound as overvalued. In contrast, the Japanese yen shows a definite tendency to undervaluation. //The opinions expressed in this column represent those of the author only.

ECAT	Finance Minister Richard Hu will unveil a generally pro-business budget on Friday with few surprises, analysts said. "I'm not expecting any surprises," Jimmy Koh, regional economist at I.D.E.A, told Reuters. "If anything it will be pro-business so we might see another percentage point taken off the corporate tax rate to get to the 25 percent level, which is a long-term goal," Koh said. Analysts see the July 11 budget as part two of December 1996's interim budget, passed as a holding measure to guarantee expenditure plans ahead of the January 2 general election. The poll returned the ruling People's Action Party to power with 81 of the 83 parliamentary seats. Budget month is usually February in Singapore and with just seven months to go until the next one, commentators forecast little substantial change presented to parliament on Friday. "Last year saw lowering of corporate tax, flattening of the personal tax structure, changes to witholding tax and a drop in property tax. They might not jump straight in with more this time," said one tax accountant. "I think the government will want to keep something in reserve for next year," he added. Last year's tax give-aways cost the Singapore exchequer about Singapore $2.5 billion (US$1.7 billion). Analysts were reluctant to make predictions about the size of the expected budget surplus -- forecast at S$7.1 billion for the fiscal year to April 1997 in the February 1996 budget -- but they thought the level would be under pressure. "Revenues will have been hit by falling retail receipts and weaker exports so it's difficult to pin down the number," said one economist with a foreign bank who declined to be identified. Injecting vigour into the slowing Singapore economy -- seen growing at five to seven percent after years of double-digit expansion -- was viewed as a priority, as were measures to enhance regional competitiveness. Winnie Liew, tax partner at accountant Arthur Andersen, said aligning corporate and personal tax at the 25 percent level could be one option, as would be allowing consolidated offsetting of corporate tax in group accounts. "We hope consolidated offset will be allowed because it has been on the business wish-list for quite some time," she said. "There is a greater need for group offset as Singapore companies become increasingly diversified and become exposed to different parts of the economic cycle," she added. A third successive personal income tax rebate of 10 percent was thought unlikely by analysts, particularly as some 70 percent of Singaporeans fall outside the scope of its structure. Some analysts thought it more probable there might be some form of relief for lower income families in public housing. (US$1=S$1.43)
CCAT	The Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan (DIC) said on Tuesday that it is planning to set up a group with public and private sector help next month to consider measures to collect problem loans run up by failed "jusen" mortgage firms. "We think securitisation of the problem loans is one effective measure to collect them, but we have just started considering details," a DIC official said. The group could be joined by officials from the finance, construction and justice ministries along with local and foreign securities houses, but no details have been decided yet, he said.
GCAT	The Yugoslav opposition planned to boycott Tuesday's session of Federal Parliament after more than three weeks of protests failed to force President Slobodan Milosevic to accept its victories in annulled local elections. Zoran Djindjic, one of the leaders of the opposition coalition Zajedno (Together) on Monday told independent radio B-92 there was no point in sitting in the assembly which diplomats regard as a rubber-stamp for Milosevic's decisions. As Djindjic threatened the walk-out, tens of thousands of protesters continued their daily pro-democracy demonstrations into their fourth week. Monday's crowd of some 100,000 filled the city centre to renew demands that Milosevic back down on a decision to overturn opposition victories in local elections last month. Earlier more than 40,000 students also rallied, this time venting their anger at police headqarters over the alleged beating of an opposition supporter. The students were outraged by reports of a savage beating meted out in prison to Dejan Bulatovic, 21, a worker from the northeastern town of Sid who was arrested on Friday for carrying an effigy of Milosevic in prison garb. Radio B-92 said Bulatovic was sentenced to 25 days in prison for disturbing public law and order. He was one of about 100 protesters that the opposition alleged had been detained for participating in the marches. The United States notched up pressure on Milosevic to talk to the opposition by cancelling a meeting between the Serbian president and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum. A U.S. official said Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum had been scheduled to meet Milosevic in Belgrade later this week after a NATO meeting but decided to call it off. "We're cutting him (Milosevic) off little by little," said the official, adding: "He's doing it because he doesn't think it's useful to talk to Milosevic at this particular moment...It's in reaction to recent events, absolutely." Kornblum's boss, Secretary of State Warren Christopher underlined the message, issuing a stern warning for Milosevic not to use violence to put down the protests. "I would hope and expect that there would be a unified action on the part of NATO members reflecting the comments that I've just made," he told a news conference in Brussels. Christopher did not say what action he expected but appeared to be referring to a joint statement or proposal. The daily round of protests in Belgrade are the most sustained challenge to Milosevic's nine years of rule in which he has maintained a tight grip over state institutions. Despite the rallies that seem to grow with each day and the barrage of U.S.-led international criticism, Milosevic maintained an aloof image of stability and control. He dominated the first ten minutes of the state-controlled national television news bulletin, with plans to upgrade a trans-national highway system. The demonstrations rated a passing mention of "fewer opposition supporters than before who walked around Belgrade city, disrupting traffic." Milosevic's powerful wife Mira Markovic, who also leads the United Yugoslav Left (JUL) in coaltion with the ruling Socialists, also appeared in an attack on Zajedno's rallies. "JUL condemns the activity of the coalition Zajedno, reflected in street demonstrations along with violence, terrorism and jepoardising the safety of Belgraders," she said. "The consequence of such protests is material damage, destruction of the countries image, and disruption of the production process." Apart from two days of protests in which marchers smashed windows in state television and newspaper offices, Zajedno organisers have kept strict control over the rallies, limiting attacks to shouted insults and building damage to egg-stains. The police have kept a low profile but Zajedno officials are concerned that Milosevic might yet run out of patience and use force to snuff out the protests.

GCAT	Weeping crowds mourning the death of Deng Xiaoping swamped the hamlet where China's political patriarch was born, prompting authorities to send armed police to keep order, officials said on Friday. Thousands of mourners flocked to Paifang village in Guang'an county in the southwestern province of Sichuan, some falling to their knees and weeping, said an official at Deng's former residence, now a museum. "There are a lot of people crying, some of them young, but most of them are older," the official said by telephone. "Some old people have knelt on the ground and wept. Their faces were covered in tears," he said. Deng, architect of market-oriented reforms that transformed China into a rising superpower, passed away on Wednesday night aged 92. Officials at Deng's old courtyard abode, which normally saw some 100 visitors a day, were unable to handle the flood of people that broke over the hamlet after Deng's death was announced early on Thursday. "About 3,000 people came here yesterday," the official said. "Today there will be more." "It's extremely crowded in here," he said. "Anywhere there is room to stand is crowded with people." Officials sent the paramilitary People's Armed Police to maintain order at the museum, which had been converted into a makeshift shrine to Deng, he said. "Although there are a lot of people, everything is orderly," the official said, adding that no incidents had been reported. A large photograph of Deng hung over the courtyard entrance, crowned by a black banner with white characters reading "Mourn Deng Xiaoping With Sorrow", he said. "One young fellow cried and said 'Without Deng there would not be the happy life of today'," the official said. Mourners, many wearing black armbands and holding white, handmade paper flowers, filed past the photograph, bowing or kneeling in front of a table heaped with cypress branches symbolising uprightness and longevity. Some of those paying their last respects to Deng had come from distant Guangzhou and Shenzhen in the southern province of Guangdong, a booming region that owed its prosperity to his ambitious capitalistic reforms, another museum official said. "Taxis, shops, hotels...and those who have come to Guang'an for business or as tourists are displaying white flowers to show their grief over Deng Xiaoping," the China News Service said. The outpouring of sadness and reflection in Paifang contrasted with the bustling streets of Beijing, where flags flying at half-mast on the second day of official mourning were the only sign of a break from routine. The Supreme People's Court, China's top judicial body, ordered all courts to ensure strict law enforcement and to safeguard social stability, the official Xinhua news agency said. Political transitions in communist China in the past have been fraught with difficulty and the deaths of some previous senior leaders have triggered mass protests.
ECAT	Canada will likely balance its budget by fiscal 1998-99, helped by low interest rates and healthy economic growth, Toronto-Dominion Bank economists said on Wednesday. The bank made the forecast in a report on Canadian government finances. Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin has a C$9 billion deficit target for fiscal 1998-99, although it is widely seen as too conservative. Once the federal budget deficit is eliminated, TD said the federal government may deliver a sizeable tax cut, which could take effect by 1999. "The federal and provincial governments can look forward to a lower debt service burden in the years ahead, which will permit them to offer more tax cuts, and invest in key programs", Teresa Courchene, TD senior economist said in a statement. TD said the debt burdens of Canada's federal and provincial governments were on a steady downward path. The bank predicted that by fiscal 1999-2000, the federal and provincial governments were poised to record a combined surplus for the first time in more than two decades. If federal and provincial governments ran even small surpluses, TD said the combined government debt burden could fall to about 70 percent of GDP within ten years, from its current ratio of about 100 percent. The combined federal and provincial debt is expected to top C$860 billion (US$620 billion) this year. ((Jeffrey Hodgson (416) 941-8105, e-mail: jeffrey.hodgson@reuters.com))
CCAT	Spain announced on Friday that flagship airline Iberia has signed key alliances in Europe and North America, seeking to close the door on its troubled past and set the stage for its privatisation. Iberia, on the verge of collapse just two years ago due to high costs and souring Latin American investments, signed long-promised preliminary agreements with British Airways and U.S.-based American Airlines. Both carriers have an option to buy a minority stake in Iberia by December 31, kicking off the state-owned group's privatisation, state holding group SEPI said. "(This will) strengthen (Iberia's) market position at home, assuring and extending its leadership in traffic between Europe and Latin America, as well as increasing its presence in the European, North Atlantic and Asian markets," SEPI said. Both commercial deals foresee the establishment of agreements on code-sharing, frequent-flyer programmes, cargo operations and other areas where services can be improved. "The agreements, once developed, will permit Iberia to increase its offer of flights and international connections... in what will be one of the world's biggest networks of global routes," SEPI said. Iberia, which has faced a rocky road to renewed profitability, turned a profit of 3.5 billion pesetas in 1996 after narrowing its loss by 75 percent in 1995 from 41.5 billion a year earlier. "It (the agreements) can only be good news. It might be a stimulus to move the Iberia project forward," an analyst in Madrid said. At the end of June, Iberia chairman Xavier de Irala said Iberia was speaking with BA, Air France, KLM, Swissair and Alitalia on a European alliance, but apparently opted for the group that had been most exposed to fierce international competition. For its U.S. alliance, Iberia was also considering a deal with Continental Airlines, SEPI said this spring. "BA is twice the size of Iberia in terms of passenger carriers...American overall is the second largest in the world," said Kevin Fogarty, transport analyst at Daiwa Europe in London. "What (Iberia) has to gain is a truly global partnership." In December 1995, the European Commission approved an emergency state cash injection of 87 billion pesetas to save Iberia from bankruptcy, but required that the group rid itself of the bulk of its Latin American holdings. Iberia had to cut most of its 85 percent stake in Aerolineas Argentinas, whose losses had dragged Iberia deep into the red, along with its shares in Argentine domestic airline Austral and Chile's Ladeco. Iberia also had a holding in Venezuela's Viasa. Chilean airline Ladeco said in April that Iberia would sell its 38 percent stake in the carrier and shareholders in Venezuela's Viasa agreed to liquidate this loss-making airline within a year. In Friday's announcement, SEPI also said American would buy 10 percent of Aerolineas Argentinas and its local sister Austral, while Iberia would keep 10 percent in the group. -- Madrid Newsroom +34 1 585 2167
GCAT	The Chilean army has asked a sculptor to stop making toy soldiers of former military ruler Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the artist said on Thursday. "They've asked me to please stop making, selling and distributing them until the general can review them," sculptor Juan Antonio Santis said. Pinochet's admirers have been buying up the three-inch (7 cm) lead figures of the former strongman by the dozen. Santis said the army called to ask him to hold off until Pinochet approves the toy figures of the smiling general wearing full uniform and a flowing military cape. The hand-painted figures sell for $29 at a hobby shop that specialises in military models and toy soldiers. "We've been sold out of the Pinochet figurine for several days now. We've got a waiting list of people ready to buy them," said the shop owner's daughter, Janina Aragon. Santis said his work was not a homage to Pinochet, who ruled Chile with an iron fist from 1973 to 1990 and is still a very controversial figure as commander-in-chief of the army. "This is not a tribute to Pinochet but rather a recreation of a person who is historic whether you like him or not."

CCAT	France will sell a minority stake of between 30 and 50 billion francs ($5.3 and $8.8 billion) in France Telecom from May 6 in what could become the biggest French flotation ever, chairman Michel Bon said on Wednesday. The finance ministry, which had set an original minimum goal of 25 billion francs for the sale, declined to specify the percentage of the France Telecom share capital which would be sold, saying it depended on market demand. Bon told a news conference that the price range for the shares would be announced in the evening of May 5 after which retail investors would have three weeks to subscribe to shares. The final price will be announced in the evening of May 26 and trading on Paris and New York exchanges is set for June 9. "The size of this operation will naturally depend on market conditions at the time and on market demand for France Telecom shares. Today, on March 19, the initial indications are very encouraging," Bon told a news conference. "The first survey results reveal tremendous interest from retail investors... This has led the French government to consider giving this operation a much broader dimension than previously planned," he said. "If the stock market's current positive outlook is confirmed, this would be by far the largest privatisation ever carried out in France," he added. In February 1994, the government raised 35.7 billion francs from the sale of shares in oil group Elf-Aquitaine . The France Telecom receipts will provide money for other state-owned firms -- whose capital injections are meant to be funded from privatisation revenues -- and help meet a growing bill to plug holes in such companies as troubled bank Credit Lyonnais and insurer Groupe GAN . France Telecom officials said while the size of the float and split between private and institutional investors depended on the market, an "ideal" model would see 30 percent go to the market, 10 percent to France Telecom staff and a further 10 percent to ally Deutsche Telekom for a 1998 share swap. France Telecom, Deutsche and Sprint Corp of the United States are partners in the Global One alliance. Analysts have so far put a range of between 100 and 200 billion francs on the market value of France Telecom. The company will on Thursday hold a day-long briefing for analysts after which Bon said the range would be "narrowed." France Telecom said it had made a 1996 net consolidated profit of 14.5 billion francs, against 14 billion in 1995. But after non-recurrent special charges, the 1996 net attributable profit was 2.1 billion francs against 9.2 billion in 1995. Operating income climbed to 30.3 billion francs from 29.6 billion. Sales rose to 151.3 billion francs from 147.8 billion in 1995 -- making it the number four world telecoms group in sales terms after AT&T , Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan and Deutsche Telekom but before British Telecom . Full liberalisation of the French and European telecoms market will start on January 1, 1998, and rivals are already preparing to enter the French market. One is the Cegetel unit of Cie Generale des Eaux with British Telecom and Mannesmann AG . Another is a venture of Bouygues with Italy's STET .

GCAT	European Union security officials (corrects from interior ministers) agreed at a secret conference in Paris to study harmonising anti-terrorism laws and speeding up extradition procedures, a French terrorism expert said on Friday. Roland Jacquard, head of the International Observatory of Terrorism, told Reuters that France's Jean-Louis Debre hosted a meeting on October 22. The French Interior Ministry had no immediate comment on the report. "Debre secretly hosted a meeting of European anti-terrorism officials (corrects from ministers), and justice and police representatives from the United States were also present," said Jacquard, who advises French authorities on terrorist threats. He said a working group was set up on harmonising anti-terrorism laws and on speeding up extradition procedures. "The plan is for such conferences to take place every three months," Jacquard said. The October conference followed a Paris meeting held on July 30 which included foreign and security ministers of the Group of Seven most industrialised nations and Russia. They persuaded Washington to dump proposals for sanctions against what it calls "terrorist states", instead working to toughen international standards for detecting bombs and protecting aircraft and other public transport. French President Jacques Chirac has said that talks on security, crime, drugs and money laundering would figure prominently at an EU summit on Friday in Dublin, Ireland. "Bit by bit, we have to move towards harmonising legislations," Chirac said in a television interview on Thursday, adding that concrete measures would be adopted in Dublin. "Because the risk is that a criminal could slip through the net by going from one country to another and by using differences in legislations which make arrest difficult in certain conditions," he said. In Europe, extradition has been a bone of contention between France and other countries as Paris anti-terrorism magistrates investigate a wave of bombings blamed on Algerian Moslem fundamentalists which killed eight people last year. French former interior minister Charles Pasqua has accused Belgium, Germany, and Britain of offering immunity to Islamic guerrilla groups in exchange for promises not to operate on their territories. But Chirac said in ihis interview that police cooperation, especially with Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy, had been significantly reinforced. Debre has discussed harmonising anti-terrorism laws, and easing extradition procedures, at bilateral meetings with his Spanish and Italian counterparts.  REUTER
GCAT	Five Filipinos shaved their heads with scissors and razor blades and more than 30 others launched a protest fast in front of a Philippine church on Wednesday to protest against Monday's APEC summit. "This is our way of showing what APEC will do to our country. Foreign companies will come and exploit our cheap labour and deplete our environnment," housewife Jesusa Rebite, 30, told reporters while fellow demonstrators gave her and four male activists a crude shave with scissors and blades. The first one to lose his hair had a "No to APEC" written in red on his shaven head, which he showed to curious passersby as he sat on the steps of the Philippine Independence Church on Manila's congested Taft Avenue. Their fasting colleagues said they would not have any solid food for the next 24 hours. Nearby, they laid an effigy of a farmer with stakes labelled "APEC" driven into the body. The annual meeting of the 18 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum began in Manila on Wednesday, with officials laying the groundwork for the summit on Monday in nearby Subic to discuss the group's stated goals of free trade in the region.
GCAT	China cautioned Japan on Tuesday to act carefully to avoid bringing instability to the Asian-Pacific with its strengthened security ties with the United States. "We hope Japan can take lessons from history by acting cautiously and walking the road of peaceful development," Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told reporters in reply to a question on the security pact.   "The Japan-U.S. security alliance is a bilateral arrangement formed during the Cold War," the spokesman said. "With the end of the Cold War, there is no reason for this kind of arrangement to go beyond the scope of the two sides," he said. He added that limiting cooperation would avoid bringing instability to Asian-Pacific countries. Japan and the United States decided on Sunday to send emissaries to China to explain stepped up security cooperation between the two countries in a move that would give Tokyo its highest military profile since World War Two.
MCAT	A resurgence of demand from importers taking advantage of a strong Kenyan shilling weakened the currency marginally on Wednesday, commercial bank dealers said. The Central Bank of Kenya posted a commercial mean of 53.06 against the dollar, compared with 52.96 on Tuesday, while against the pound it was posted at a mean of 86.75 from 86.50. "The demand was sudden and under normal circumstances would not have moved rates, it's just that right now, the market is extremely sensitive," one dealer from a leading bank said. Dealers said the fact the central bank had indicated it would keep out of the market and allow rates to find their levels of equilibrium had made them nervous about maintaining long dollar positions without a buyer of last resort. "Over the last three days, we've kept a spread of 30 cents, which shows they're slightly anxious," one dealer said. Some dealers expressed concern that a strong shilling would hurt exporters and the shilling was overvalued at current levels. But a senior central bank official told Reuters the bank believed that given economic fundamentals, the shilling was still very undervalued. Dealers said they saw any demand as an opportunity for the shilling to correct itself and retrace its steps to 54. The money market remained tight with overnight rates quoted at 20 percent levels unchanged. --Wambui Chege, Nairobi Newsroom ++254-2 330-261
CCAT	Telecommunication vendors said on Wednesday compatibility in global digital wireless systems would protect existing investments and keep consumer costs down. Officials from four major U.S. and Canadian phone makers -- Lucent Technologies, Motorola, Northern Telecom (Nortel) and Qualcomm Inc -- said they would jointly promote a new standard digital format with that in mind. They announced joint efforts to develop specifications for next generation wireless communications standards at a CDMA congress in Singapore "If you really want to move toward a global standard and gain acceptance, you can't ignore existing investments people have made," said Anthony Hennen, Motorola senior vice president and general manager (cellular infrastructure products group). The new third generation digital system using wider-band Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology aims to be more widely used than current systems, he said. The companies hoped to see a convergence in global systems, including compatibility with a new competing standard in Japan. "We have to work together to provide a single standard instead of varying standards that drive down volume," said John Major, executive vice president at QUALCOMM. The proposed new standards using existing CDMA technology would meet or exceed the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) requirements for high speed data transport to a single subscriber, company officials said. These requirements include wireless data rates of 144 kilobits per second (kbps) at mobile speeds, 384 kbps at pedestrian speeds and two megabits per second while stationary. The more advanced CDMA system will improve voice quality by reducing static and allow for higher subscriber capacity. Cellular phones in the United States are mostly on CDMA technology, while other countries are using a variety of systems such as the global system for mobile communications (GSM). "We've seen some major announcements coming out of Japan for CDMA. They have selected the technology over GSM, to be implemented in their market in 1998," said Perry LaForge, executive director of the CDMA Development Group. He said China was conducting trials with commericial orders already in place, and markets in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan were seeing better subscriber growth. The CDMA technology is expected to be available in Singapore within the next few months, he said. LaForge said CDMA technology aided costs savings by reducing the number of base stations required to transmit signals. Fewer base stations lower infrastructural costs, real estate investment and removes the need for laying cables, he said.

GCAT	A mutinous army commander in the ex-Soviet republic of Tajikistan charged on Tuesday that the government had scuttled intended peace talks with an air raid on his positions. "Today, at 10 a.m. (0500 GMT), I was supposed to negotiate with the head of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) peacekeeping force but government aircraft bombed Kalininabad this morning," Colonel Makhmud Khudoyberdyev told Reuters by telephone. "I don't think the negotiations will take place," the 34-year-old rebel colonel said from his base near the southern town of Kurgan Tyube. But a spokesman in Dushanbe for the predominantly Russian peacekeeping force in the central Asian republic told Reuters that no talks had been scheduled. Kalininabad, some 120 km (80 miles) south of the capital Dushanbe, is close to Khudoyberdyev's headquarters. He did not say whether there had been any casualties in the air raid. The commander of an elite government armoured brigade who has mutinied twice before, Khudoyberdyev moved his armour towards Dushanbe at the weekend in the wake of heavy fighting between two warlords in the Tajik capital. He lost a strategically important aluminium smelter west of Dushanbe to Rakhmonov's guard on Monday. An armed standoff ensued and continued on Tuesday. Khudoyberdyev said he was ready to return to barracks if the presidential guard did the same. "I agree to peace talks and I want peace in Tajikistan," he said. "If the presidential guard go back to barracks, my forces will return to Kurgan Tyube". Reporters were not allowed past a government checkpoint five km (3 miles) south of Dushanbe. A senior interior ministry official at the post said it had been quiet overnight around the contested town of Fakhrobad, about 30 km (20 miles) south of Dushanbe, and that fighting had not yet resumed on Tuesday. Khudoyberdyev, regarded by Western diplomats as politically ambitious, has not revealed his goals. "I'm not trying to move on Dushanbe," Khudoyberdyev said. "Government forces provoked us by moving toward Kurgan Tyube -- we had to defend ourselves". The outbreak of fighting has no connection with Tajikistan's armed Islamic opposition, with whom the government signed a peace accord in June aimed at putting an end to four years of civil war. War and instability in Tajikistan, a mountainous country of 5.7 million people, has carved the republic into fiefdoms under the control of maverick armed groups much like those in neighbouring Afghanistan. On Sunday, Rakhmonov issued a three-day ultimatum to  Khudoyberdyev to lay down his arms or face "destruction".
ECAT	New Zealand's economic year climaxes this week with Treasurer Winston Peters' Thursday budget an entree for central bank governor Don Brash's main course on Friday -- the June Monetary Policy Statement (MPS). Peters has said he will confirm a NZ$5 billion fiscal stimulus spread over three years, while Brash is seen endorsing an easing of monetary conditions markets have already delivered. Economists said on Monday the two events should, if served according to plan, provide a pick-me-up for an economy that has been spluttering instead of cruising, as previously predicted. Brash said in the Reserve Bank's March Economic Projections the economy had troughed, but subsequent events have shown it weaker than forecast and it may only now be touching the bottom. Friday's likely easing will be followed by another easing in September, Bankers Trust NZ chief economist David Plank said. And the easing window will be opened wider, stay open longer and be closer later than previously been expected, he added. The New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's forecast is economic growth will recover from a 2.1 percent rate in 1996/97 to 2.5 percent in 1997/98 and peak at 4.3 percent in 1998/99. There is much variation in the view of how aggressively the RBNZ will tighten next year as it anticipates the growth surge. ANZ economists predict a 150 basis point tightening from the latter half of 1998 while others predict only about 20 basis points in each of the last three quarters of 1998. SBC Warburg economist Robin Clements said markets may test the bank's tolerance limits by pre-empting the September easing when they get an easing green light on Friday. "My forecast is that the economy will be picking up early in 1998 and some time through the first half of 1998 the bank will start to have a bias towards tightening rather than easing, and by the end of 1998 we will be where we are now or even tighter." The June MPS, one of the bank's quarterly set pieces used to help it steer the economy towards its 0-3 percent government-set inflation target, is expected to sanction a 50 to 80 basis point easing of interest rates from 7.5 percent set for June quarter. The RB also uses the New Zealand dollar Trade-Weighted Index as a second indicator of monetary conditions, recognising that the TWI can influence both interest rate levels and inflation. Monetary conditions, measured as a combination of indicator 90-day bill rates and the TWI, are currently 110 basis points equivalent below the level set by the RBNZ in March for the June quarter, and markets may ease even further on Friday. "We are pushing through 100 points now and there is some indication that the market considers conditions still on the tight side," said Deusche Morgan Grenfell chief economist Ulf Schoefisch. "I would expect after the statement that conditions would fall further from current levels." He expects the bank to formally ease conditions 75 basis points and to allow a range of 75 points either side of that. The RB in March forecast a steep downward track for inflation in 1998 -- to an annual rate of 0.8 percent -- and economists say pressures have diminished even further since. The labour market has softened, productivity is stronger, exchange rate strength has fed into import prices, house prices have eased and the March quarter CPI surprised on the downside. "The whole package looks much more encouraging for inflation," Warburg's Clements said.
ECAT	Pakistan needs to take "decisive" measures to stabilize its economy, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on Thursday. "There is a need for a decisive set of measures to be implemented by the government,' IMF First Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer told Reuters. "That is what we're looking for." Fischer is flying to New York today to meet Pakistan Prime Minister Benazhir Bhutto to discuss what needs to be done and the possibility of the IMF sending a mission to the country to try to work out an economic plan with the government. The IMF withheld an $80 million tranche due in June, and part of a $600 million standby loan, pending a review of Pakistan's 1996-97 budget. "We'll see whether the government can implement the polcies that are needed to stabilize the situation," Fischer said. An adviser to Bhutto told the IMF/World Bank annual meeting on Wednesday that Pakistan was working to get back into the good graces of the two organizations. Bhutto is also slated to meet World Bank President James Wolfensohn Thursday. Wolfensohn, who is flying to New York for the meeeting, termed the get-together a "courtesy call."
ECAT	South Korea again denied on Tuesday official involvement in a frugality campaign that has hit imports ranging from cars to televisions, and said it would set up an office to hear importers' complaints. The anti-import austerity campaign has angered some of South Korea's trading partners, which maintain the drive targets imports and is backed by the government. Similar campaigns in the past were encouraged by the government. But in a statement, the Foreign Ministry said the country's "dire" economic circumstances had prompted the media and civic groups to blame excessive consumption for a widening trade deficit. "It is against this background that some non-governmental civic groups, of their own accord, initiated frugality campaigns aimed at discouraging extravagant consumption and encouraging practical consumerism," the ministry said. Recent trade figures have shown a marked decrease in South Korea's imports of consumer goods. South Koreans have associated imports with unneeded luxury items. The Foreign Ministry statement said the government would designate the Division of International Cooperation of the Ministry of Finance and Economy to handle "import grievances". The Trade Ministry would also expand its Trade and Investment Facilitation Office by adding a grievance hot-line and assigning an expert to deal with importers' complaints, the statement said.
GCAT	German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel visited Bulgaria on Thursday with a pledge of support for the new government and its efforts to revive the economy. On a three-hour visit to Bulgaria's second city of Plovdiv, Kinkel assured his hosts of Germany's backing for their applications to join NATO and the European Union. "Bulgaria belongs to Europe. Bulgaria is welcome in the European Union as soon as possible," Kinkel said after talks with President Petar Stoyanov at a 19th century merchant's house in Plovdiv's old town. Kinkel pledged German support at next month's donor meeting in Brussels of the G-24 industrialised countries, which will draw up a financing package to accompany an International Monetary Fund standby accord agreed in principle last week. He declined to give a figure. Corruption and the failure of successive governments to implement reforms brought the economy to the brink of collapse. The IMF prescribed a tough fixed exchange rate regime as a last resort after previous programmes failed. Kinkel warned that measures to rescue the economy were painful but inevitable. "You will make it, it will be tough but the bitter medicine will ensure that you recover," he said. Bulgaria has little hope of entering the EU or NATO in the first wave of eastern expansion, but both groups see it as a force for stability in the Balkans, and with an eye on Albania and Serbia are keen to keep it in their sphere of influence. Kinkel said that countries which failed to make it into the first wave should not feel abandoned. "The door will stay open and we will find ways to give the feeling to those who don't make it that they are welcome and the way of course stays open," he told reporters. Bulgaria has attracted a string of prominent visitors since a 30-day protest campaign fuelled by economic hardship toppled the Socialist government last month. Bulgaria has an association accord with the EU, and one of the first decisions of the new interim cabinet was to make a clear statement of their desire to join NATO, an issue on which the Socialists had always been ambivalent for fear of upsetting their traditional allies in Moscow. Kinkel signed a technical cooperation accord with Bulgaria, and delivered a private donation of medical supplies worth 40,000 marks to the regional hospital in Pazardzhik. He arrived in Bulgaria from Turkey, where he assured the Ankara government that it had a place in Europe, but listed human rights problems, economic troubles, an armed Kurdish rebellion and quarrels with EU member Greece as serious obstacles to eventual Turkish membership in the EU.
GCAT	Anxious Pakistanis are still waiting for Saudi Arabia to list victims of a fire that ravaged a pilgrim encampment near Mecca, an official said on Saturday. "The Saudi government has told us it will furnish the latest list tonight," said the official at an emergency information cell set up near Islamabad after Tuesday's blaze which Saudi authorities say killed 343 people and injured 1,290. "We have received about 80,000 calls in the past three days," the official said. "We are working 24 hours a day." Confusion persisted over the casualty toll. The official, who asked not to be named, said 13 of an unknown number of Pakistani fatalities had been identified. Pakistan's ambassador to Saudi Arabia Shahid Amin said on Thursday that 35 Pakistanis were missing from the haj tents, but did not confirm that they had died in the fire. Saudi Arabia's Pilgrimage Affairs and Religious Endowments Minister Mahmoud bin Mohammad Safar told Amin on Friday night the Pakistani toll might be higher than first reported, the official news agency APP said. "He (Safar) informed the ambassador that on the basis of circumstantial evidence and the number of dead bodies already recovered from Pakistani haj camps and the streets surrounding them, the actual figure of casualties among Pakistani nationals may be higher than reported earlier," APP said. "However, given the stampede that took place in haj camps after eruption of fire, it cannot be said with authenticity that the dead bodies recovered from Pakistani camps are necessarily those of Pakistani nationals," it added. APP said Safar had set up a committee at the Pakistani government's request to provide more definite information about Pakistani fire victims, but this "may take some more time". Diplomats in Saudi Arabia said most of the dead were from the Indian subcontinent. The fire also engulfed the Iranian, Syrian, Lebanese, Egyptian, Sudanese, Yemeni and Moroccan sections of the encampment at Mina, near Mecca.
ECAT	August consumer price inflation that was even less subdued than expected, combined with very modest retail sales activity during the month, has called into question the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase later this month, economists said. While economists had expected consumer prices to be up 0.2 percent in August and for that Consumer Price Index (CPI) without its food and energy items to be up 0.2 percent as well, the government reported instead that the CPI and the core CPI each rose just a very slight 0.1 percent.   The two reports spurred a rally in the bond market, which is fearful that the economy is not slowing sufficiently in the second half of the year to keep interest rates from rising. The bond market fears strong growth and the inflation that growth can typically engender because inflation devalues outstanding bonds. After the data were released, the 6-3/4 percent 30-year bond, which was down 5/32 and yielding 7.07 percent in nervous trade, climbed more than a full point to 97-05/32. Its yield fell back below seven percent to 6.98 percent.   "This is very important because it's taking the Fed out of action for the September meeting," said Patrick Dimick, Treasury market analyst at CS First Boston. "It allows the Fed to be staring at a low unemployment rate and say it's ok because it's not going any lower. It provides them with an excuse to endure a low unemployment rate." Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent in August, the lowest rate in more than seven years. Other economists questioned whether the data was certain to keep the Federal Reserve from raising rates in September.   "I don't think (the CPI and retail sales data are) enough to prevent a Fed rate hike, but that's the hope that is clearly in the market right now," said David Blitzer, chief economist at Standard and Poor's, told Reuters Financial Television. "(The) CPI shows you (that) at the retail level ... you are not seeing any meaningful upward pressures," said Kevin Flanagan, first vice president and money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Pretty much any way you slice it, (the August 0.1 percent CPI) is a positive figure; it ... will probably be welcomed by the Federal Reserve."   Waldo Best, senior economist at BZW Securities Inc, said Friday's data were "definitely more favorable for the bond market than expected and that's why the market's moving very fast here." But Best said he did not think the data provided "a justification for why the Fed may hold off in September." Best called the CPI a lagging indicator "so it's not so much of a reason for them to not raise rates in September as (it is a confirmation that) they were doing the right thing six to nine months ago."   After the data, the Treasury yield curve steepened with the spread between two-year-note and 30-year-bond yields widening to 86 basis points from 80 basis points at Thursday's close and in early trade on Friday. While the chance of a Fed tightening is never completely out of the market, the Treasury market has priced in a below-50 percent chance that the central banks will raise rates, said CS First Boston's Dimick. -- 212-859-1679
GCAT	Olympic and world high hurdles champion Allen Johnson repelled the European challenge on Friday to set a year's best time at the Bislett Games grand prix. The American, unaffected by a total of four false starts before the race finally began, clocked 13.14 seconds, relegating Germany's Olympic bronze medallist Florian Schwarthoff to second place. Schwarthoff clocked 13.21 with Britain's world silver medallist Tony Jarrett third in 13.30. Jarrett's compatriot Colin Jackson, the world record holder, was fourth 0.04 of a second further back. Johnson, who said he would race three more times before the Athens world championships in August, praised Schwarthoff's performance. "We have had a lot of tough races over the years," he said. "It was a tough race, he is very strong." The German said Johnson had dominated the first half of the race. "I will try to give him a hard time at the world championships," he said. Two Commonwealth athletes set year's bests early in the meeting, first of the Golden Four series. New Zealander Beatrice Faumunina threw a national record of 68.52 metres in the discus and Australia's Olympic silver medallist Cathy Freeman clocked 49.39 in the women's 400 metres. "I am relieved," Commonwealth champion Freeman said. "I did not think I was in that shape." Canada's Olympic and world 100 gold medallist Donovan Bailey won the 200 metres from European champion Geir Moen. Bailey, slow out of the blocks, trailed Moen at the turn but pulled back to win from the Norwegian in a wind-assisted 20.14.
CCAT	British engineering firm Weir Group Plc said on Thursday that it has secured a deal to maintain a specialist workshop at a process plant on the northern coast of Algeria. The contract is worth around four million stg over two years and was awarded by U.S. firm MW Kellogg, which is renovating the process plant on behalf Algeria's state-owned oil and gas company Sonatrach. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 4019
ECAT	Chilean industrial production rose 3.8 percent in July over the same month last year, while sales in the industrial sector rose 3.2 percent in July, the trade group Sociedad de Fomento Fabril (Sofofa) reported. The July rise in industrial output marked an increase of 5.3 percent with respect to June and brought the rise for the first seven months of the year to 1.9 percent. The seven-month figure was well below over economic growth in that period and, combined with 2.1 percent drop in industrial sales in July, reflected the general slowdown in Chilean economic growth this year.   The Central Bank's restrictive monetary policies plus the dollar's slide against the peso have both taken a toll on industrial output since the second quarter, Sofofa officials said. The peso's rise reduces income for exporters while making imports more attractive. They announced the figures at a news conference. --Rodrigo Martinez/Roger Atwood, Santiago newsroom +56-2-699-5595 x211
ECAT	UK average earnings, touted by many economists as the key British figure of the week, are forecast to hold steady at an annualised 3.75 percent in July. Meanwhile, unemployment is expected to continue falling in August, with a consensus of economists' forecasts looking for a 15,000 decline. Both figures will be released at 0830 GMT on Wednesday. Although most economists did not expect a pick-up in earnings this time, the relentless fall in UK unemployment could put upward pressure on wages at some point. In July, unemployment dropped by an unexpectedly large 24,100, taking the overall rate to 7.6 percent, its lowest level since March 1991. David Philpotts, UK economist at Schroders, said weakness in manufacturing pay levels would offset upward wage pressures in the service sector, leaving underlying average earnings unchanged in July. "Nevertheless, a rise in the underlying rate to four percent is probable over the autumn," he said. Analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell also forecast a tick up in wage pressures, although not yet. "A rise seems likely in coming months to four percent, particularly with economic growth accelerating," they said in a client note. As for shrinking jobless queues, economists did not see signs of that trend abating, although the net drop in unemployment will not be as drastic as last month's. "Unemployment is expected to post another decline in August, largely due to recruitment in the service and retail sectors," Philpotts said. He added that the total number of vacancies at job centres is unlikely to be able to sustain the strength seen in July when the annual increase of 49,500 was the highest since 1987. Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International, said the jobless trend remains firmly downwards, but he was less concerned about that fuelling wage inflation. He backed the consensus forecast for a 15,000 fall in August. "There's not really any evidence that the pressure is feeding through into wages," he said. Indeed, he said the reverse could happen in the months ahead. "Historically, there has been a strong correlation between headline inflation and wage levels. Wage settlements could actually ease back in the months ahead." Headline retail price inflation has dropped from 3.5 percent year-on-year in July 1995 to 2.2 percent last month. But Marian Bell, economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, was less sanguine. She said underlying average earnings growth could push up to 4.0 percent this time around. Unit wage costs, the third prong of Wednesday's labour force figures, are forecast to show growth of 3.3 percent for the three months to July versus the same period a year ago. Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said unit wage costs tend to fall when output rises and vice versa. Given a 0.5-percent jump in manufacturing output in July, he said a fall in unit wage costs was expected. But he warned the figure tends to be dominated by cyclical swings and is unreliable as an inflation indicator. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109
MCAT	Short interest in 4,085 securities on the Nasdaq National Market aggregated 1,310,247,885 shares by December 15, compared to 1,259,221,592 shares in 4,051 issues for November, the exchange said Thursday. Nasdaq said the December short interest represented 2.60 days' average daily share volume for the period against 2.51 days in November. It said short interest in 1,401 SmallCap Market securities aggregated 56,122,061 shares for December compared to 53,610,861 shares in 1,425 securities for November. Nasdaq said the open short-interest positions it reported for each security reflect the total number of shares sold short.
GCAT	Russian President Boris Yeltsin is likely to hand over power, including the "nuclear button", for a period of 10 hours to two days when he has heart surgery, an aide said in an interview published on Tuesday. Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin chief of staff, told the Izvestia newspaper that Yeltsin was expected to issue a decree handing his duties temporarily to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin just before he has surgery. "It is a question of a document which will act perhaps for 10 hours or perhaps a day or two," Chubais said in the interview in the newspaper's Wednesday edition. Asked if this would include handing over the "red button" which launches Russia's nuclear missiles, Chubais said: "Yes." A council of doctors is due to convene on September 25 or 26 to decide when Yeltsin, 65, will have a bypass operation to improve the supply of blood to his heart. Yeltsin has not confirmed he will give up his powers temporarily but his press secretary has said the president is considering various options for doing so. The constitution says the prime minister should assume the president's duties temporarily if the head of state is incapacitated but Yeltsin has not formally named Chernomyrdin as his deputy. The constitution does not stipluate how the transfer of power should take place. "I think that at the moment the operation is to be undergone -- that is when the president cannot carry out his duties -- a presidential decree will appear legally defining how power is specifically transferred to the prime minsiter," Chubais said. "Correspondingly, after the operation another decree will appear which will repeal the previous one."
GCAT	Ultrasound examinations can detect breast cancer in some women whose dense breasts camouflage the tumours from mammography x-rays, according to a study released on Monday. "It is estimated that mammography misses about 15 percent of cancers in women with dense breasts," New York radiologist Thomas Kolb told the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. "In our study, physician-performed, high-resolution breast ultrasound detected 10 cancers that were missed by mammography in a group of 2,600 women with dense breasts, and detected them at a size and stage comparable to cancers detected by mammography," he said. Of 8,323 women in the study who underwent a mammography exam, 2,600 mostly younger women were identified as having dense breasts and were given an ultrasound exam in which echoes from high-frequency sound waves form an internal picture. The ultrasound exams found breast masses in 195 patients whose growths were undetected by x-rays, 10 of which turned out to be cancerous. "My personal feeling is that all women with dense breasts can benefit from ultrasound," Kolb said. "However, we must look at all the risks and benefits, including costs and long-term effects on survival before recommending implementation of widespread ultrasound screening for women with dense breasts." A typical breast ultrasound exam costs about $150.
CCAT	Profitability at Volvo Car, the biggest division of Swedish automotive group AB Volvo, will improve during autumn as its new S40/V40 car series replaces the older 400-series, Volvo Car managing director Tuve Johannesson said on Wednesday. "The profitability of the 400 series is useless. The S40/V40 is bringing a change of profitability that will have obvious implications," Johannesson told Reuters in an interview. He declined to give a precise forecast for Volvo car sales for the second half of 1996 after Volvo car reported a small operating profit of 378 million crowns in Q2 1996 following two quarters of losses. "The main reason is that we have achieved balance and managed to bring operating costs under control," he said. The car division's sales fell 7.0 percent to 39.83 billion crowns in the first half of 1996, but new orders for its medium-sized car sector rose 11 percent thanks to the introduction of the new series. "So far we have received 41,000 client orders for the S40/V40 and produced 30,000 of the new models. We are now over our planned rate of production for the model and are looking for total production this year of between 65,000 and 70,000," Johannesson added. -- Henrik Alberius, Stockholm newsroom +46 8-700 1250
CCAT	Hong Kong property tycoon Stanley Ho said on Wednesday he did not expect the territory's future government to launch droconian measures to crack down on the residential property market. "I am confident that the future government will be very discreet and will not be ready to take harsh measures to deal a blow on the property market," Ho, chairman of property developer Shun Tak Holdings Ltd, told reporters. The British colony reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30. The post-colonial government is expected to launch measures to curb soaring residential prices. The Bank of China said in a quarterly report published on Wednesday that the long-term cure for Hong Kong's high property prices would be to increase housing supply, but new taxes could also be imposed to check speculation. Hong Kong's future chief executive Tung Chee-hwa has said problems in the territory's pricey residential property market would be at the top of his agenda after he assumed his position on July 1. Ho, who is also president of the Real Estate Developers Association of Hong Kong, said too much government interference would be undesirable. "Too much control or interference will not do us any good," he said. "The free market must be maintained. Hong Kong is successful because we have a free market based on supply and demand. And speculation is not that serious in the sector." Developers take measures to check the participation of speculators when they put projects on the market, he said. "We do not like speculators ourselves. We hope that the market will contine to be steady and there is small growth -- and that's all we want," Ho said. The association hoped to see no interference into the free market, and was opposed to the introduction of new taxes and any executive measure similar to those launched in 1994, he said. In 1994, the government launched a package of measures to cool the overheated sector, including raising the minimum initial sales deposit on new flats and outlawing the resale of uncompleted flats before they are assigned. Ho expressed optimism over the future of Hong Kong. "I am very confident that after the handover, Hong Kong will continue to grow and I am really very optimistic," he said. "Besides, I think that many of the leaders told me that they must try to do better than the English," he added. Ho said he expected no immediate changes after handover. "I think everything will be as usual." -- Carrie Lee (852) 2843 6590
GCAT	London's ethnic minority population will rise 40 percent in the 20 years to 2011 when blacks and Asians will constitute more than half the population in two of the capital's 33 boroughs, research showed on Tuesday. The London Research Centre said that by 2011, 28 percent of London's population of 7.03 million would be from the ethnic minorities, compared with 20 percent in 1991, when 6.90 million people lived there. The Indian population would rise to 452,000 from 362,000, the black Caribbean population to 379,000 from 304,000 and the black African population to 321,000 from 170,000. In Brent, north London, ethnic minorities would make up 52 percent of the population in 2011 compared with 45 percent in 1991. In Newham, an east London borough hit by a number of racist incidents, the black and Asian population would rise to 61 percent in 2011 from 43 percent in 1991. The London Research Centre is subscribed to by all 33 boroughs and claims to be London's leading provider of research on urban affairs.
ECAT	U.S. durable goods orders in September likely rebounded from a sharp decline in August, boosted partly by aircraft purchases, analysts said. Economists polled by Reuters, on average, predicted September orders rose 2.0 percent overall and 1.3 percent without defense orders. August orders fell 3.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. The data are due to be released Friday, October 25 at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT.
CCAT	China's central bank on Tuesday dismissed a report by rating agency Standard & Poor's that the bad debts of China's banking sector could total about $200 billion. "This is totally groundless," a spokesman for the People's Bank of China said when asked to comment on a report by S&P on Monday that flawed or "impaired" loans in China's banking sector could total US$200 billion. "I think the true figure should be much lower," said the official, who declined to be identified. China does not make public the size of bad debts -- loans with little chance of being recovered -- of its state banks. The unrecoverable debts to state banks amounted to about two percent of total outstanding loans, the spokesman said. U.S. economic forecast firm DRI/McGraw Hill said last month that 20-40 percent of the estimated $600 billion in outstanding loans in China's banking sector were non-performing. In the past, China's central bank has estimated 13-14 percent of outstanding loans were non-performing while two to three percent would never be recovered. Chinese state banks used to extend loans without considering the creditworthiness of their borrowers and acting in line with policy directives from the central government. China's four big state commercial banks are the Bank of China, the Construction Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. -- Beijing newsroom (86) 10-6532-1921; Fax 6532-4978
GCAT	A Paris court on Monday struck down expulsion orders against three of 10 African immigrants who staged a 52-day hunger strike for the right to stay in France, lawyers said. Riot police ringed the administrative court as it considered appeals against expulsion orders for about 80 of 210 protesting immigrants forcibly ejected from a Paris church last week. Lawyer Anne Bremaud said the court ruled that they could not be deported in view of their health. Police had said only one of the 10 would qualify for a residence permit, but the government has said it would not expel anyone seriously ill. The 10 hunger strikers, most of them from Mali, called off their fast on Sunday after police released them. "They have started taking mashed food as they are unable to eat any solid food. They are very tired," said their spokesman, Doro Traore. An IPSOS opinion poll published by the daily Le Monde showed voters split on the government's policy to firmly enforce the hardline immigration laws while carrying out a case-by-case review of the protesters' situation on humanitarian grounds. Forty-six percent approved and 46 percent rejected it. The protesters were resting after moving their headquarters to a disused ammunition factory in the eastern Vincennes suburb. Some were enjoying the sunshine in the Vincennes park after weeks holed up in the Saint-Bernard church. Lawyers managed to get most protesters released at the weekend in a legal battle to keep them in the country, prompting some media to accuse the government of confusion. "The Great Muddle," the left-wing daily Liberation said in a headline of the confusion about the legality of expulsion orders. Police stood guard outside the court after riots broke out among sympathisers on Sunday night when the court announced that it had rejected 12 of 20 appeals against expulsion. Traore said all but 15 of the protesters were free and in the care of human rights groups. Four were deported to Senegal, Mali and Zaire on a French air force plane at the weekend. Three others were jailed for to two to three months, and a few were still held. Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre has said 30 to 40 percent of the protesters would be allowed to stay in France. His adviser on immigration, Jean-Claude Barreau, told Liberation the percentage could reach two thirds. President Jacques Chirac has pledged to stick to the strict 1993 laws, despite a furore from left-wing parties and human right groups, in order to send a "strong signal" to discourage potential immigrants from poor countries. He promised to review details of the enforcemnt of the laws, which the protesters say outlawed immigrants previously living legally in France, and promote aid to poor nations. With an eye on the anti-immigrant electorate of the far-right National Front, he said French people, regardless of their politics, felt "a growing irritation over immigration". The IPSOS poll said 46 percent of voters sympathised with the protesting immigrants, to 36 percent who were hostile. It showed the electorate divided on the 1993 "Pasqua" laws pushed through by then interior minister Charles Pasqua. One third said they should be hardened while 20 percent favoured a softening, 35 percent wanted them unchanged, and four percent repealed altogether. Eight percent had no opinion.
CCAT	Hungarian trading company Csopak Szovetkezeti Rt will pay a 10 percent dividend on 1996 earnings as against eight percent the previous year, following shareholders' approval on Saturday. Dividend payments will start on May 20. In 1996 the group posted a consolidated after-tax profit of 260.9 millon forints on net sales of 8.61 billion. Csopak CEO Gyorgy Markovszky told the annual general meeting Csopak planned a consolidated pre-tax profit of 980.8 million forints on sales of 18.75 billion for 1997, and saw an extraordinary net income of 427 million from real estate sales. He said Csopak would like to spend 250 million forints on dividends on the 1997 earnings. In an interview with Reuters earlier this month Markovszky said Csopak was going ahead with its plans to become an increasingly trading-oriented group, founded on hopes of a recovery in domestic consumption, giving up its classic role as a holding company. He also said, however, that Csopak's plans for 1997 include the consolidation of earlier acquisitions rather than going ahead with new ones. Csopak is 32 percent owned by the U.K-based East European Food Fund which acquired its stake via a private placement last December while the state-owned Hungarian Development Bank (MFB Rt) has 21 percent. On Saturday, the AGM approved the consolidation into Csopak of its four wholly-owned subsidiaries, Forum Rt, Pannoncoop Rt, Veszpa Kft and Chance-96 Kft. These mergers will leave Csopak's issued share capital unchanged. However a share swap, under which local government shareholders of household chemicals trading subsidiary Komfort Rt will receive one Csopak share for each Komfort they hold, will raise Csopak's capital by 250 million forints to 2.45 billion. The company informed its shareholders that it would apply for the requalification of its shares to the listed "A" category of the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) from listed "B". Among other differences, the "A" category carries stricter obligations on providing information. -- Emese Bartha, Budapest newsroom +36 1 327-4040

GCAT	Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic is expected on Saturday to acknowledge opposition victories in local elections and call for a coalition government, a senior political source said. "Milosevic will endorse a report by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in entirety. The statement is being written as we speak," the source told Reuters. There was no official confirmation of the statement or when it would be released, but sources expected it to be on Saturday before a meeting of the major powers' Contact Group on former Yugoslavia in Brussels. An OSCE mission led by former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez last month endorsed all claims by the the opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition. Zajedno claimed it won in 14 of Serbia's 18 largest cities including the capital Belgrade, but Milosevic's Socialists annulled the victories, claiming unspecified irregularities. Cancellation of the November 17 election results triggered a wave of street protests, now in their eighth consecutive week, which have shaked the foundations of 52 years of leftist rule in Serbia. The OSCE has given Belgrade authorities until January 16 to act on the recommendations of its mission. The decision to uphold the OSCE report and call for a coalition government was made at a meeting on Friday of senior officials from the Socialist Party and the Yugoslav United Left, headed by Milosevic's wife Mirjana Markovic, the political source said. A call will be issued for "all left and democratic forces in the country to unite and form a coalition government for the sake of (protecting) the national interest," the source said. Gonzalez' report did not mention the biggest prize Zajedno claims to have won -- the Belgrade city assembly. But if push comes to shove that will be conceded as well over the week, the source said. Conceding election victory would placate the West before it might move to impose sanctions on Yugoslavia. The Contact Group of five major powers was meeting in Brussels later in the day to step up pressure on Milosevic. "I have the impression that they are going to try to get a unified position," said a NATO source. "They will probably come out with a fairly strong statement." The United States has led the unanimous Western condemnation of Milosevic's abuse of democracy in Serbia, cutting Belgrade off from desperately-needed foreign capital. The European Union has called on Milosevic to accept opposition victories and embrace democracy and human rights. Its Council of Ministers of the European Union is expected to address the Serbian crisis at a meeting on January 20-21. Milosevic expects that conceding victory to Zajedno would end the highly embarrassing demonstrations and reduce the risk of civil war that some authoritarian hardliners pray for, another senior political source said. Serbian opposition leaders promised round-the-clock traffic jams in central Belgrade on Saturday, the 55th straight day of peaceful protests against poll fraud. "Take you cars, take your whistles and trumpets, use you car horns, make a din to be remembered and do it non-stop on Saturday," Zajedno leader Vuk Draskovic told his followers Ear-splitting gridlock is the latest in a series of imaginative ploys by Zajedno. "Take your cameras and take pictures together with the police. Record the historical moments for posterity," Draskovic told Belgraders who have been squaring off daily with hundreds of riot police. Milosevic, facing the biggest challenge to his 10-year rule, has been abandoned by part of the army, the Orthodox Church and on Friday even by his normally staunch allies at the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences. Milosevic has conceded his party's election loss in Serbia's second largest city Nis but failed to appease the West or Zajedno leaders, who vowed to continue protests until all their claims were met.
MCAT	European oil swaps fell on Thursday as oil markets were dragged lower by news that the German government planned to sell some of its oil reserves this year. The only exception to the trend was naphtha which gained $1 a tonne, support by Asian demand. Brent futures were trading some 25 cents a barrel lower by mid-afternoon and Brent CFD swaps, which have been firm in recent days, followed suit. Brent CFDs slipped a couple of cents a barrel for next week's dates to talk 13 cents under September while the following three weeks slipped about seven to 10 cents a barrel. Monthly CFDs were also under pressure talking 26 cents under the front IPE Brent for the balance of the year. Gas oil crack spreads against Brent were heard traded at $4.25 a barrel for 4Q97 compared to $4.30 and $4.35 on Wednesday. Gasoline swaps slipped $2 a tonne trading at $185 for August during the afternoon and easing to $182.50 for physical barges in Rotterdam. By the close dealers pegged levels at $184.50 July, $185 August and $183.75 September. Naphtha bucked the weaker trend, gaining $1 a tonne to $180.50 for both August and September. Dealers said the widening crack spread against Brent reflected support from Asia and some tightness of end July supply. Heavy fuel swaps were little changed from Thursday as support from the U.S. and Singapore was offset by falling Brent futures. Rotterdam barges edged up to $86.50 on the physical market and July swaps ended around $85.25 with August at $86.50. Forward levels were little changed with the fourth and first quarters at $92.50 and $96 respectively.

MCAT	The Bulgarian lev closed at 2,130-2,150 per dollar, unchanged from the morning's 2,120-2,160 but softer from Tuesday's close of 2,000, due to dollar short-covering, dealers said. "Mostly banks whose lev liquidity was boosted by payments on government securities bought dollars for short-covering, keeping pressure on the lev today," one dealer said. Small final clients also bought foreign currency to meet pending payments, traders said.   Banks pared forex positions on Tuesday in anticipation of further lev gains after the local currency advanced to around 2,000 from around 2,500 on Monday amid low dollar demand.

GCAT	Organisers of the Sydney 2000 Olympics expect a budget surplus of up to A$50 million (US$39 million) and have set up a A$150 million "rainy day" fund, organising committee president Michael Knight said on Thursday. Knight told a news conference he expected the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) budget surplus to be larger than the A$20 million estimated in 1993 when Sydney won the right to host the Games. "So a surplus of somewhere in the A$20 million to A$50 million range will come from the Sydney Games," Knight said. SOCOG's budget has grown to A$2.4 billion from the A$1.7 billion in its bid to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). SOCOG has said television rights would raise A$1.6 billion, major sponsors A$500 million, and the rest would be met through merchandising and ticket sales. Knight said SOCOG would make a direct payment of A$200 million to the New South Wales (NSW) state government to help defray the cost of building Olympic facilities. Local media and politicians have questioned the finances of the Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA), the NSW government body charged with building Olympic infrastructure. The government said in its 1996/97 budget that the cost of building Games infrastructure had risen to A$1.91 billion from an original budget of A$1.54 billion. The OCA budget does not include the building of the Olympic village or stadium, expected to be met by private investment. Underwriters of a public share float to build the main Olympic stadium said last week their float had been massively undersubscribed, leaving them with a A$214.3 million shortfall. Knight, the NSW Olympic Minister who also heads the OCA and is president of SOCOG, said a SOCOG "contingency fund" had also been established for unexpected expenses. "There will be a large figure of at least A$150 million of contingency or rainy day fund to cover any unexpected expenditures and of course, if not used up, then 90 percent of that will be refunded to the taxpayers as profit," Knight said. Full details of both SOCOG and OCA budgets will be made public in May when the government hands down its 1997/98 budget. Opposition politicians in the NSW state parliament on Thursday introduced proposed legislation aimed at forcing the government to make regular reports on the cost of the Games, including expenditure reviews and estimates of future costs. "There is growing concern that the true cost of the Olympics is being hidden by the...government and will only be revealed after the Games have concluded," said opposition leader Peter Collins. A major factor in Sydney winning the Olympic bid was that the state government would underwrite the cost of the Games. The controversial Atlanta Olympics last year were not government-backed and Games organisers forced to cover a US$1.7 billion budget struggled to break even. (A$1 = 0.78)

GCAT	The only son of comedian Bill Cosby was killed by an unidentified gunman early on Thursday as he stopped to change a flat tire on his Mercedes-Benz convertible along a California freeway. The body of Ennis Cosby, 27, was found sprawled on the pavement next to his dark green car and police said they had a witness to the attack. A white male suspect was being sought and investigators said robbery appeared to be the motive. Bill Cosby, a 59-year-old star of film and television and one of America's most popular comedians, was grief-stricken but kept his composure when told of his son's death, police said. "He was my hero," a grim-faced, puffy-eyed Cosby told reporters outside his apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The entertainer, whose TV comedy series "Cosby" is filmed in New York, appealed to the Los Angeles Police Department to "do anything possible to find and locate and prosecute the suspect," said Cmdr. Tim McBride, a police spokesman. "We have every confidence in the LAPD," Cosby said in a statement released by his publicist. "Our hearts go out to each and every family that such an incident occurs to. This is a life experience that's truly difficult to share." Cosby planned to fly to Los Angeles to make funeral arrangements, police said. Ennis was Cosby's only son. The comedian and his wife Camille also have four daughters. The younger Cosby overcame learning disabilities to earn a master's degree in special education at Columbia University's Teachers College in 1995 and was studying for his doctorate, college spokesman Roy Campbell said. He spent his last day at the college on Dec. 18 tutoring a young boy with learning disabilities and was due to return next week when classes resume, Campbell said. "He was dedicating his life to the noblest of professions -- educating our children -- and yet that same life was stolen," said former New York City mayor David Dinkins, a professor of public affairs at Columbia. The attack took place just after midnight near an exit ramp off the San Diego Freeway, about 15 miles (25 km) west of downtown Los Angeles. Cosby was heading north to a friend's house in the San Fernando Valley, police said. "He apparently experienced a flat tire, pulled his car off the freeway and was apparently shot for unknown reasons," McBride told reporters. A woman saw at least part of the attack and described the gunman as a white male, he said. Police declined to identify the witness, but a woman in a short skirt and fur coat was seen being questioned by investigators at the scene. A police source said Cosby died of a single gunshot wound. He made at least one call on his cellular phone before the attack but police refused to say to whom the call was made. McBride said robbery was the "logical motive" but noted that "it doesn't appear that anything was taken." He said there was no reason to believe Cosby was being followed or stalked, but added, "he may have been taken by surprise." McBride described Bill Cosby as "extremely upset" but "very coherent" when he was told of his son's death. Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Entertainment, called it an "unthinkable tragedy" and offered his support to the Cosby family. After police cordoned off the crime scene, the body was taken to the coroner's office and the car was towed away for further examination for clues. McBride described the neighbourhood of the attack as "very peaceful, very expensive homes, very little crime ... But every once in a while some unexplainable act of violence occurs, and this was one of them." Bill Cosby is known to millions of TV viewers as a pitchman for various products and for his role as the loveable Dr. Huxtable, the obstetrician-father on NBC's "The Cosby Show," which first aired in the United States in 1984 and remains popular in re-runs worldwide. Cosby, who has written several books including "Fatherhood", is now starring as a father and husband in a new TV series, "Cosby."
CCAT	The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) said on Thursday that it approved separate applications by telephone companies for broadcast distribution licenses. The federal government regulator said it granted applications to conduct testing and technical trials of broadcasting services to BCE Inc's wholly owned unit Bell Canada and TELUS Corp's wholly owned TELUS Cable Holdings Inc. Bell will deliver packages of basic and discretionary broadcasting services, including Canadian specialty, pay and pay-per-view services, a navigator system or "Interactive Program Guide" to highlight Canadian programming, a promotional channel, pay-per-view, and digital multimedia interactive services. Bell intends to test the packaging of certain broadcasting and telecommunications services, including a high-speed personal computer internet access service.  Services under the trial will be available to 3,500 homes in parts of London, Ontario and Repentigny, Quebec, for a two-year period ending May 31, 1999. TELUS will also offer basic and discretionary broadcasting television services, including Canadian specialty, pay and pay-per-view television, and AM and FM radio services. TELUS also may offer a package of broadcasting services and a high-speed personal computer internet access service. The two TELUS trials will involve 2,000 subscribers in Lake Bonavista, a suburb of Calgary, and 1,400 subscribers in the suburbs of Edmonton. Those trials also will end on May 31, 1999. "The trials will provide real learning opportunities about the digital environment for existing broadcasters and producers, the chance to develop, test and apply Canadian-produced multimedia content in conjunction with broadcasting content, as well as the navigational tools to support Canadian programs and services," said CRTC Chairwoman Francoise Bertrand in a statement. Last week the government commission said it threw the local telephone market open to competition while also promoting convergence between the phone and broadcast businesses.

The new discount falls five cents a barrel under the last ANS deal, done April 11 at $1.32 Crude oil for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) fell 30 cents a barrel Thursday to $19.91, on technical selling. Outright prices for ANS crude dropped 30 cents $18.43/18.63 a barrel. On a notional basis, Line 63 was talked 95 cents a gallon under ANS, or $2.37/2.27 under May West Texas Intermediate/Cushing (WTI). The grade rarely trades off WTI. Traders reported no deals in Line 63 and heavy California grades. --David Brinkerhoff, Los Angeles bureau, +1 213 380 2014

GCAT	One thousand police will be on hand at the second leg of the Italian Cup final between Vicenza and Napoli on Thursday. Police are concerned that many Napoli fans may travel north to the match without tickets. Vicenza's Menti stadium holds little more than 20,000 people and tickets have been sold out since last weekend. Both sides come into the game aware that it offers a last chance not to finish the season empty-handed. Napoli have a one-goal advantage from the first leg in Naples three weeks ago. A cup victory could represent an extra $2.5 million of revenue next season by way of participation in the Cup Winners' Cup. Victory would give the southern side their first trophy since the halcyon days of the late 1980s and early 1990s when Argentine Diego Maradona led to them to two league titles as well as to a 1989 UEFA Cup and 1987 Italian Cup win. Despite a good start to the season, Napoli narrowly avoided relegation from serie A this year and parted company with coach Luigi Simoni on acrimonious terms on the eve of the first leg of this final. "Given the way our season went it's a major achievement to have got to this final and I'm not off my head when I say that this cup could be more important than the two league titles won by Napoli", said goalkeeper Pino Taglialatela. Vicenza have guaranteed their first division survival but missed out on a possible UEFA Cup qualification. The club are currently in the hands of an official receiver following an investigation which led to the arrest last month of club president Gianni Sacchetto on fraud charges. Despite that, captain Giovanni Lopez, who missed the first leg of the final through suspension, believes his side have every chance of winning the cup. "The only thing that worries me about Napoli is their one-goal lead, as for the rest we can handle it," he said. Vicenza will be without defenders Davide Belotti and Uruguyan Gustavo Mendez, both suspended, while Uruguyan striker Marcelo Otero is injured. Napoli are without two suspended players in defender Francesco Colonesse and Brazilian midfielder Andre Cruz, while striker Alfredo Aglietti is doubtful because of injury. Teams (probable): Vicenza - Pierluigi Brivio; Fabio Viviani, Luigi Sartor, Giovanni Lopez, Massimo Beghetto; Alessandro Ianuzzi, Domenico Di Carlo, Giampiero Maini, Gabriele Ambrosetti; Roberto Murgita, Giovanni Cornacchini. Napoli - Pino Taglialatela; Roberto Ayala; Bertrand Crasson, Francesco Baldini, Mauro Milanese; Roberto Bordin, Raffaele Longo, Alain Boghossian, Fabio Pecchia; Massimiliano Esposito, Nicola Caccia.
MCAT	1030 GMT - Hungary's forint ended quiet Tuesday morning trade slightly firmer against the dollar and currency basket. * At midday, the forint stood at 196.18/23 to the dollar, compared to an opening 196.25/30. * The forint continued to move closer to the National Bank of Hungary's resistance level (NBH bid), ending at midday about six pips from the bid, compared to eight to ten pips at the opening and 15 to 20 on Monday. * Dealers said the recent spate of forex buying was over and sales would likely emerge on Tuesday. * The NBH fixed the forint/dollar at 196.17 at noon. (The forint floats within the NBH's 4.5-percent wide intervention range, against a currency basket made up 30 percent of the dollar and 70 percent of the mark.) -- Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327 4040
GCAT	The U.S. State Department on Tuesday defended last week's decision to certify Mexico as an ally in the war on drugs, saying Mexico's cooperation in the fight against narcotics traffickers was essential. Given the shared 2,000-mile (3,219 km) U.S.-Mexican border, "if we walk away from the Mexicans, we'll be shooting ourself in the foot," spokesman Nicholas Burns said, responding to criticism from Congress and elsewhere. "We need the Mexicans to win this (anti-drugs) war, and they need us. We have this symbiotic relationship with Mexico that nobody can disregard. And if we're going to win the war on drugs, we've got to have the cooperation with the Mexicans," he said. Burns also stressed that the United States is "part of the problem (because) there's a tremendous demand in this country for narcotics." President Clinton last Friday recertified Mexico as an ally in the war against drugs despite widespread corruption in the Mexican government. Decertification could have led to U.S. economic sanctions. He praised President Ernesto Zedillo for the arrest of the country's former anti-drug chief, who was charged with taking bribes from drug kingpins, and other Mexican officials. Clinton's action drew strong criticism from Democrats and Republicans. Resolutions to overturn the certification have been introduced in the Senate and are being considered in the House. Clinton could veto such a resolution if it passed Congress and it would then need a two-thirds majority in both chambers to take effect.
MCAT	Sliding front month NYMEX paper crude prices deflated benchmark cash crudes in the U.S. Gulf Thursday afternoon, but grade barrels continued to stake firmer differentials on refiner buy moves. July West Texas Intermediate/Cushing stood 15 cents weaker at $18.70-80 a barrel, figuring a 10 cents premium for cash over screen paper quotes on Exchange for Physical values. Outright prices have found technical selling pressure since morning, lopping off 10-12 cents more than August declines, leaving the July/August roll around -12 cents. Markets noticed, but failed to rally higher on a diplomatic tussle underway at the United Nations. Both the U.S. and British delegations came out in favor of imposing new sanctions on Iraq for blocking U.N. weapons inspection teams from sites in June. Further consultations will resume Friday, but the state of the dialogue pits the U.S. and U.K. against China, Russia and other key Security Council states who don't favor increased sanctions. At issue is the American and British draft resolution to reprimand Baghdad by preventing Iraqi government officials, members of the army and police and their immediate families from travelling abroad. The draft also calls for a suspension of sanctions reviews until Baghdad offers full cooperation with U.N. Special Commission inspection teams. Back in the cash crude world, traders were more attuned to the newfound strength in grade differentials. Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James moved to positive price territory against benchmark WTI/Cushing on refiner position-squaring. Refiners have spent much of June waiting for North Sea Brent cargoes to flood the Gulf, but the narrowed arbitrage and other factors squelched those expectations. Other grades firmed as well, led by West Texas Sour/Midland where deals were done at low $1.20-25 discounts to the cash marker. Still, cash traders said there are sweet West African and a slew of Latin American sours available for purchase. "There is no problem with finding the crude. People just got caught with their positioning, this isn't a huge fundamental shift," said a cash trader. WTI/Cushing Postings Plus stabilized around $1.80-85. --Patrick Connole NY Energy Desk ((+1 212 859 1620))
GCAT	A 22-year-old Israeli sewer cleaner has died choking on the same poisonous vapours that killed his father and two brothers nearly a year ago, his family said on Wednesday. Residents found Oren Levy of Matzliah in central Israel dead in a manhole on Tuesday on the same sewer in which his father Yisrael, 55, and brothers Koby and David died from fumes last September. Those deaths had shaken Oren but his mother Mazal Levy told Channel Two television: "He wanted the work of his father to go on, that all of the (business) empire which he built up for 30 years wouldn't collapse." Relatives said Oren Levy refused to use a gas mask.
MCAT	WCE canola ended down on commercial and hedge selling, traders said. "Hedges picked up, crushers bought the July, commercials bought on Chicago's firmness and canola's weakness. UGG, Cargill traded both ways. Commission houses took profits," a trader said. March futures crush profit margin rose to -22.87 from -25.32 Wednesday on CBOT soy oil, meal. Mar-May spread $0.50, Mar-July $0.40, July-Nov $36.50, May-Nov $37. Volume was 8,854 lots, or 177,080 tonnes, and 1,365 hedge lots. March canola fell $2.30 to $408.40 and May slipped $1.50 to $408.

GCAT	Edinburgh's festival month ended at the weekend with organisers claiming a record-breaking box office success for the 50th annual arts extravaganza. Ticket sales for the official International Festival passed the two million pound ($1.5 million) mark for the first time, despite cancellations of some major offerings and a mixed reception from both critics and public for much of the rest. The Fringe, the world's largest art festival, sold more than 1.5 million tickets for 1,301 different shows offered by 650 companies over four weeks. The Military Tattoo on Edinburgh Castle esplanade had even more success. It sold 99.38 percent of 217,000 tickets available for performances of precision drill, Zulu warriors, military bands, and massed pipes and drums from Scotland, Canada and Hong Kong. The Film Festival kicked off with a gala premiere featuring its Edinburgh-born patron Sean Connery and notched up a record 110,000 ticket sales in two weeks. The one-week International Jazz Festival also topped previous sales. Lord Provost (Lord Mayor) Eric Milligan said the festivals add about 140 million pounds ($218 million) to the city economy. "Edinburgh is bursting," said Brian McMaster, director of the official festival. "I don't think it's ever been so busy." "It's really satisfying to see so many people queuing up in the street to buy tickets," added Fringe director Hilary Strong. "We have sold tickets to a much wider audience than ever before." The official festival suffered several cancellations. Concerts were not greatly affected by the withdrawal of leading conductors like Mariss Jansons. But cancellation of two solo drama pieces -- Robert Lepage's "Elsinore" after equipment failure and "The Seven Sacraments of Nicholas Poussin" by Nicolas Bartlett's illness --  were costly blows. The world premiere of "Ines de Castro", first full-length opera by contemporary Scottish composer James MacMillan, was judged to fall short of his earlier promise. Critics were also disappointed in Houston Grand Opera's "Four Saints in Three Acts" by U.S. composer Virgil Thomson with libretto by Gertrude Stein. Two Gluck operas produced by dancers, one by the American Mark Morris and the other by Germany's Pina Bausch, also had a mixed reception. "I don't think dancers prancing about centre stage as the real characters sing from the wings is opera," one disgruntled visitor said as he left the Festival Theatre. ($1=.6420 Pound)
MCAT	Sri Lanka's state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has awarded its light naphtha export tender for May to Swiss trader Glencore at $1.23 per barrel below Singapore spot quotes, free-on board (fob) Colombo, a CPC source said on Friday. The tender which offered the 110,000-125,000-barrel cargo for May 2-3 lifting, closed on April 23 and bids were valid for two days. CPC received four bids for the cargo, the source said.   The bearish naphtha market has depressed prices and in its last tender, CPC sold to Japanese trader Tomen 110,000-125,000 barrels of light naphtha at a much higher price of 88 cents per barrel below Singapore spot quotes, for March 24-25 lifting fob Colombo. -- Singapore Newsroom (+65-870 3086)

MCAT	Colombia's peso ended 45 centavos lower at 1,017.45 in a market wary of possible central bank intervention to halt the local currency's recent rise against the dollar. Interbank dealers said fears of central bank intervention were prompted by a bank announcement Monday that it was prepared to jump into the market and buy U.S. currency if the peso moved above resistance at 1,015.20 to the dollar. The peso hit an intraday high of 1,014.90 in trading Monday without any sign of bank intervention.   But traders said the mere threat from the bank had established a temporary ceiling for the peso that market players were reluctant to test. The central bank has been fiercely criticized by the government and leading exporters for allowing the peso to gain sharply since June, undercutting the value of export revenues and making Colombian goods less competitive aboard. Dealers reported 299 trades in Tuesday's session for a total of $108 million. -- Javier Mozzo, Bogota newsroom, 571 610 7944
GCAT	Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Sunday issued a call to boost patriotic education and national unity as Beijing struggled to handle a renewed territorial row with Japan and separatist strife in ethnic minority areas. In a speech on the front page of the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, Jiang called for a strengthening of patriotic education to help make China more powerful. "The patriotic enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country should be turned into a mighty force to promote the reform, opening-up, modernisation and revitalisation of the Chinese nation," Jiang said in the speech. The speech was delivered to senior party officials last October, but was made public as a simmering dispute between Beijing and Tokyo over an island group in the East China Sea flared up once again. "The Chinese people have never yielded to invaders, and they have the glorious tradition of ardently loving freedom, seeking progress and guarding national dignity and state sovereignty," Jiang said. "Furious hatred of foreign invaders, boundless disdain for the nation's scoundrels who sought power and wealth by betraying the country, and great reverence for the noble-minded patriots have become our precious national character," Jiang said. Beijing last week protested a landing by a group that included a conservative Japanese legislator on the islands, which are known as the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus in Japanese and are claimed by China, Taiwan and Japan. Tokyo has tried to distance itself from the landing but the incident has fueled nationalist outrage in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and flotillas of activists from those places are expected to sail to the islands this month in protest. Tokyo has said it will step up coastguard patrols around the islands, which are administered by Okinawa. The seas surrounding the islands are rich fishing grounds and are believed to contain big oil and gas reserves. Japan has claimed the islands, located between Taiwan and Okinawa, since 1895, while China says it has owned them for centuries. The sovereignty row ignited fiery nationalist passions in Chinese communities in Hong Kong and Taiwan last year after a Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse there. The publication of Jiang's speech also came after trouble flared on the opposite side of China, in its arid, far-northwestern region of Xinjiang. Beijing has been struggling to control violent ethnic strife in the mostly Moslem region, where members of the ethnic Uighur minority clash sporadically with China's majority Han people. In February, a series of bus bombs killed nine people in the capital of Urumqi and deadly riots swept through the town of Yining near the border with Kazakhstan. Last month, Chinese paramilitary police in Yining shot dead two people and injured five when a mob of more than 100 tried to rescue rioters convicted in the Yining upheaval from execution. "Some people do not care about undermining national prestige and moral integrity and do not care about the damage to state and national interests," Jiang said. Analysts say China has tried to muster patriotic fervour among its people to help fill a moral chasm created by almost two decades of capitalist-style reforms that have eroded traditional Marxist values.
CCAT	Specialty chemicals group Albright & Wilson Plc said on Thursday that raw material cost rises have plateaued, but there is little sign of them falling. Despite continuing high prices, Albright & Wilson, the world's biggest producer of purified phosphoric acid, lifted interim pretax profit by 6.3 percent to 32.0 million pounds amid continuing strong competition. In a telephone interview with Reuters, chief executive Robin Paul said raw material costs added 40 million stg to bills in 1995 as a whole. "That has now plateaued, but there is no significant benefit from them coming back."
GCAT	From a small rented office above a discount store by a north Sydney beach, a group of party volunteers are out to reshape Australia's political landscape. Their phones ring steadily and the fax machine spews out messages of support for their leader, Pauline Hanson. On the wall is a poster of Hanson herself, wrapped in an Australian flag in a Boadicea-like pose which sums up her appeal to the country's disaffected voters. It is classic populism -- fearless Pauline will see off the invaders -- and it seems to be working. According to the latest opinion polls, "Pauline Hanson's One Nation" party has become a potent force in Australian politics less than three weeks after it was launched by the woman behind the nation's race debate which flared up last year. One poll said 10 percent of electors would vote for a Hanson candidate for the lower house of parliament and even more for seats in the Senate. Another poll said one-quarter of electors would consider voting for her party, rising to nearly 40 percent in Queensland state where until recently Hanson ran a fish-and-chip shop. Reacting to the polls, Prime Minister John Howard dismissed Hanson as a populist whose appeal would be transient. Mid-term opinion polls counted for little, he said. "It's easy to feed off unhappiness and insecurity at a time of change, but ultimately you've got to offer a rational alternative. If you can't offer it, then that support will recede," Howard said. But he would say that -- although Hanson's success could prove a valuable weapon against a hostile parliament in coming months, Howard's Liberal-National coalition could be hardest hit if her party genuinely took root. A PARTY WITHOUT A PLATFORM Despite its opinion poll support, Hanson's One Nation is not yet a proper political party. Its registration with the Australian Electoral Commission will be complicated -- more than 70 groups and individuals ranging from Aborigines to Chinese to Holocaust survivors have lodged submissions to block what they see as a racist party. It is also a party largely without policies, except for the obvious ones: stop all immigration until Australia's unemployment is solved, restrict foreign ownership, restore tariff protection and repeal a 1994 law giving Aborigines the right to claim back ancestral lands. But as its name implies, "Pauline Hanson's One Nation" does have a boss, a shrill red-headed single mother of four known to her staff as "the leader" and to her fans simply as Pauline. Hanson won international fame last year after her maiden parliamentary speech in September. After being ditched by Howard's Liberals for comments seen as racist, she won what had been considered a safe Labor seat with a massive swing. The speech itself, in which she warned Asian immigrants could swamp Australia and complained of a "reverse racism" that favoured Aborigines, went at first largely ignored. But media interest ballooned and Hanson and the "race debate" came to dominate front pages and news bulletins for weeks, attracting wide international interest and warnings from Asia that Australia could not afford to turn in on itself. THE SELLING OF PAULINE In One Nation's headquarters in Manly, a popular seaside suburb in north Sydney, Hanson's party is being organised and promoted by David Ettridge, a marketing specialist who has worked as a fundraiser for a charity helping children in Africa. Ettridge, 51, has been portrayed in the Australian press as the new power behind Hanson's throne. It was he who managed to turn the Pauline Hanson Support Movement -- her fan club -- into a fledgling political party. An approachable man with a quick sense of humour, Ettridge appears an unlikely right-wing puppet-master. His work with the charity World Vision "makes it very hard for anyone to call me a racist, to say that Pauline Hanson is associating with racists". And he is clearly on a buzz. Ettridge says the first batch of 10,000 membership applications printed up for the party have almost all been sent out and a Pauline Hanson home page on the Internet has received thousands of hits. Ettridge says the task over the next 18 months is to transform protest votes into lasting political allegiance. The party was eager to test itself in a by-election and would soon be making up a shortlist of candidates. The pollsters themselves say the polls cannot be given too much weight. Jim Alexander, chief executive of AGB-McNair -- whose poll for the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper said one in four Australians would consider voting for Hanson's party -- pointed out that 60 percent of people said they would not ultimately vote for it. Ettridge says Hanson has all it takes to become a real party leader and those who predicted earlier this year that she would fade away have been proved wrong. "At the same time that Canberra is self-destructing, with the integrity of politicians at an all-time low, Pauline is a fresh face, she speaks her mind, she identifies with mainstream Australia, and she speaks the truth," he says. A straw poll on the streets of central Sydney appeared to back him -- many passers-by attacked Hanson but others praised her for saying what she thinks while other politicians safely stick to the party line. "I have a proverb," says a Sydney florist who refused to give his name. "Show me an honest politician and I'll show you a liar. Pauline's not a politician, she's a real person."
MCAT	The dollar advanced, forging a 41-month high against the mark before midday as the German currency was sapped of strength on the crosses, traders said. "The move is almost completely fueled by talk of a soft euro currency and concern that there will be broad inclusion in the European monetary union," said Mike Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco Group Ltd. A mark/yen decline to a new 23-month low of 63.99 tested key support and exacerbated mark selling pressure. Dollar gains were mostly a by-product of active cross-trading, dealers said.   The dollar was quoted at 1.7585/88 marks at noon compared with its open at 1.7540/50 marks and Monday's close of 1.7530/40. It broke through 1.76 shortly after noon. Sterling/mark remained strong and underpinned the dollar. A surprisingly strong rise in British inflation and the likelihood of a minimum 25 basis point rate hike lifted the pound and some expected a peak above 3.00 before week's end. "It's been really one way price action for a while and it looks like there's nothing to stop it for the time being," said James Powers, vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Westdeutche Landesbank Girozentrale.   "It's difficult to buy sterling at these levels, however, it just seems to go higher," Powers said. In midday trade, the dollar held above its opening level of 112.60/70 yen to trade at 112.65/75. Despite an improving bid, dealers said bias was to sell dollars toward 112.00 and ahead of Wednesday's release of Japan's current account data. Comments from Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara that Japan's foreign exchange goals had not changed signaled a favored 110-120 dollar/yen range and helped the dollar early, but fell out of focus in U.S. time, dealers said. The dollar rose as high as 113.45 yen after the remark.   "We expect to find some bids down at the 112 level," Powers said. "For the most part it seems that the interest is to sell on rallies. The dollar went up a big figure after Sakakibara's comments and it probably shouldn't have, now we're right back down around the 112.50 level. In other markets, the dollar rose slightly against the Swiss franc at midday to 1.4635/45 from 1.4630/40 at the open. It was weaker at Canadian $1.3741/46 at midday from C$1.3770/75 at the open.

GCAT	Franklin Roosevelt wished Winston Churchill happy birthday and Joseph Stalin joined in the fun. What a birthday party! What a setting! Churchill would splutter on his cigar to see it now. The residence of the British Legation in Tehran, venue of Churchill's 69th birthday party in 1943, is nowadays a sad shadow of its former grandeur. A wildly luxuriant Wistaria has damaged the structure, mortar is crumbling and, within, ornate plaster is in need of restoration. The roof needs attention and the guttering too. The clock in the bell-tower, built by the same company that made London's Big Ben, has not struck in years. The residence, built in 1870 during Iran's Qajar period, wears an air of grimy neglect like an aged aunt who can no longer afford to look after herself properly. Local restorers have examined the fabric and an expert is due from London next week. The cost of restoration runs to 400,000 pounds ($650,000) for a proper job, one of the few diplomats left at what is now the British Embassy told Reuters. The leaders of the three main allied powers fighting Nazi Germany met at the Tehran Conference for the first time. Subsequent meetings were at Yalta and Potsdam. The British prime minister had met the American president in Cairo, but it was the Soviet supremo's first visit outside his country since he assumed power some two decades earlier. Substantive meetings at the Tehran Conference were held across the street in the Soviet Embassy. They settled the date and scale of the Anglo-American landing in France and an associated Soviet offensive, and determined resources to be devoted to the Italian, Balkan and Burmese fronts. Stalin said the Soviet Union would enter the war against Japan once Germany was defeated. They also discussed the future shape of Germany and Eastern Europe, and a framework for keeping the peace between the great powers after the war. The now-famous photograph of the three allies sitting together was taken on the steps of the Soviet Embassy. WHAT A BIRTHDAY PARTY On November 30, Churchill's birthday, he hosted a formal dinner for nearly 40 guests, all political and military advisers of the three, at the Legation. The cook had to scavenge around Tehran to find 69 candles that would fit on the birthday cake. "Stalin, arriving under heavy guard, was in the best of tempers, and the president, from his wheeled chair, beamed on us all in pleasure and goodwill," Churchill wrote later in his memoire "The Second World War". "This was a memorable occasion in my life. On my right sat the president of the United States, on my left the master of Russia...When the time came I proposed the health of our illustrious guests, and the president proposed my health and wished me many happy returns of the day. He was followed by Stalin, who spoke in a similar strain." Many informal toasts followed according to the Russian custom, Churchill noted. "It must have been after two in the morning when we finally separated...I went to bed tired out but content, feeling sure that nothing but good had been done. It certainly was a happy birthday for me." On their last day in Tehran the three leaders signed an agreement guaranteeing post-war territorial integrity and economic assistance to Iran. GLORY DAYS IN THE PAST The residence is set in sprawling gardens on Ferdowsi Avenue in the heart of the Iranian capital with a lily pond and large crows swooping down from tall pines, planes and poplars. An additional wing built in 1963 with all the architectural character of a cheerless dormitory at a second-grade university once rang with the chatter of arms salesmen and oil executives during Iran's business boom in the pre-revolutionary days of the Shah. Embassy staff took refuge in the residence basement from incoming Scud missiles during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988. The residence has not been lived in since 1987. Since the Shah's overthrow in 1979 by Shi'ite Moslem clergymen who abolished the monarchy and declared an Islamic Republic, diplomatic relations between Tehran and Western capitals have been uneasy and the British mission has declined in importance. Relations were downgraded after the republic's founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini imposed a fatwa, or religious ruling, in 1989 calling on Moslems to kill British author Salman Rushdie for blaspheming Islam in his novel "The Satanic Verses". The charge d'affaires is now back in London, sitting things out in a state of diplomatic stalemate like the rest of the European Union ambassadors while each side waits for the other to make a move over German court charges of high Iranian involvement in political assassinations. It seems unlikely there will be any more birthday parties at the residence for awhile.

MCAT	Croatia's benchmark call money rate fell 50 basis points to 10 percent on Thursday on the unusually high supply of kuna funds, dealers said. "We've seen a strong rise in supply of kuna funds, and because of that the interest rate on call money loans fell to 10 percent from 10.5 percent," Jasenka Blagaic told Reuters. Blagaic said there was over 85 million kuna of fresh funds on offer against the demand of 13.5 million, which was fully met in the morning trade. Of those, call money loans accounted for 13 million, and the rest was one two-month loan granted to a savings bank at 18 percent a year. The overnight trade totalled 30.2 million, as one bank borrowed to maintain its mandatory reserves and one had shortfalls. -- Davor Huic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075
MCAT	Thai financial markets ended a stormy week on a positive note on Friday as some investors appeared to digest a major revamp of the troubled finance sector and withdrawals from weak finance companies slowed. But analysts cautioned that despite the turnaround after four successive days of hard knocks, the road ahead remained rocky. "It could well drag on for a few more months. We might see some Thai macroeconomic indicators improve, but this is a different microeconomic problem that will linger on until investors are totally convinced," said the head of research at a foreign brokerage who declined to be named. The stock market finished up 2.19 percent as bargain hunters bought cheap banking and finance stocks that brokers said may have been oversold this week. The baht firmed late, rising to 25.920/930 against the dollar from 25.948/970 earlier in the day. "In the afternoon, there was a lot more selling of dollars as the market became more settled in response to measures taken to help the finance sector. People feel the action might do good," said a Siam Commercial Bank dealer. In a sweeping restructuring, Thai authorities on Monday ordered 10 finance firms, hard-hit by a liquidity crunch, to raise capital by a total of 8.25 billion baht ($317 million). They also told banks and finance companies to raise provisions for bad loans, primarily to the depressed property sector, to 115 percent and 120 percent respectively from 100 percent. Some analysts said a statement by IMF managing director Michel Camdessus expressing confidence in Thai authorities' handling of the economy had helped. "I see them taking steps to address one of the vulnerabilities of the Thai economy... I am confident that the measures and the programme for the future will have the potential to carry the economy back on track for sustainable growth," Camdessus said in Hong Kong. Camdessus's words were "a strong and encouraging statement", a Hong-Kong based Peregrine Investment executive said. A run on deposits this week from the troubled finance firms slowed to about 3.5 billion baht in withdrawals on Thursday compared with a total of 10.4 billion baht cleared on Tuesday and Wednesday, he said. "The market seems to have calmed down, and investors have come to realise that the measures imposed by the Bank of Thailand will eventually strengthen the sector," a central bank official told Reuters. Analysts said the bitter pills prescribed to financial institutions would be hard to swallow, but had the potential to cure the illness. "The measures, especially on the sub-standard assets, will usher a long and painful adjustment period. But at the end, we think the authorities did the right thing," said Suphavudh Saicheau of Phatra Thanakit Plc, one of Thailand's biggest finance and securities firms. "Many finance firms might see zero profit for this year and next. And those small companies who cannot meet the requirement will eventually be taken over, leading to a more solid and healthy sector," he said. The troubles were exacerbated by slow economic growth and a liquidity crunch caused by the Bank of Thailand's policy of maintaining high interest rates to deter speculation in the baht, which was hit by devaluation rumours last month. Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan said on Friday that his ministry would issue zero-coupon bonds to raise funds to help sick finance firms. ($1 = 26 baht)
CCAT	Iomega Corp. said Thursday it plans to apply its computer storage technology to handheld consumer electronics in a way that could lower the cost of saving and transfering data to such devices. The reusable data storage system, to be known as "n-hand," could be used in digital cameras, computer game devices, cellular phones and handheld personal computers known as digital assistants. In cameras, for example, the technology could function as a removable "digital film" that would replace existing chemical photographic film. "Our n-hand technology ... has the potential to change the way consumers use portable electronic devices," said Kim Edwards, president and chief executive of the Roy, Utah-based company, in a statement. "We are bringing personal computer-like storage to portable devices," added George Meyer, Iomega's director of marketing for new business, in a telephone interview. The n-hand disks are expected to be priced at less than $10 for a 20-megabyte disk, and could be available by the second half of 1997. Iomega said the n-hand disks are about half the size of a business card. Several industry analysts said they believe Iomega's technology could help propel digital cameras into the consumer mainstream within a matter of years, by freeing users from the fixed capacity of existing flash memory storage and by substantially reducing the overall cost of such cameras. A digital camera could store from 50 to 80 images on a single $10 n-hand disk, Iomega said, depending on image resolution. Consumers now pay hundreds of dollars for a flash memory card capable of holding the same number of images, it noted. Jim Porter, a data storage analyst with market research firm Disk/Trend Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., said the Iomega technology could cut the cost of storing photographs by a factor of 20 times. A Kodak digital camera costing $499 currently could be priced as low as $300 within a matter of years, he said, reflecting the elimination of more costly digital storage methods. Iomega's plans pose a theat to makers of flash memory chips that are used to store digital information in such small electronic devices currently. Leading makers including Sandisk Corp., Intel Corp. and Toshiba Corp. In addition, the Iomega system could help accelerate the current digital transformation of the camera industry, leading to a decline in revenues that cameramakers receive from conventional silver halide-based photo film and equipment. "With 'n-hand' you have a digital camera that you can treat like a regular camera," Meyer said, referring to the replaceable nature of the Iomega high-density floppy disk system. "This technology can make digital cameras much more competitive with regular ones," he said. Besides lacking a low-cost removable storage medium, digital cameras offer inferior picture quality but image resolution is improving rapidly, analysts said. This could lead to explosive growth of the new cameras in coming years. Shares of the company closed up $1.375 to $25.375 on active trading on Nasdaq. On Friday, Iomega's stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
ECAT	Spain's Industry Ministry predicted an economic pick-up in the second quarter, Minister Josep Pique said on Tuesday. "We can be assured of a recovery in industrial activity in the second quarter (when) industrial production will grow 4.8 percent year on year," Pique told a press conference. He said the recovery shown in the last industrial survey extended over all subsectors, along with an increase in capacity usage. Production capacity use in the first quarter was 77.4 percent, versus 77.1 percent in the previous three months and 76.1 percent in the first quarter of 1996. Pique said this figure may rise to 80 percent in the next few months.
MCAT	Spot power prices in the most of the U.S. West lost ground Thursday due to a lack of buying interest from utilities, trade sources said. "A lot of marketers are long, but no utilities are buying," said one trader. He noted that recent high natural gas prices led many utilities to hold off from selling forward. "They wanted to run as little gas as possible and to max-out their coal, nuclear, and hydro resources." Next-day Palo Verde firm, peak power was last trading near $23.00 per megawatt hour (MWh), down from $24.00-25.00 on Wednesday. Firm, off-peak Palo Verde was quoted near $13.25. Northwest prices, however, were said to find support from the Bonneville Power Administration's decision to raise next-day offers by $1.50 to $2.00 per MWh for Friday. Next-day California-Oregon border firm, on-peak power was last quoted $25.00-26.00 per megawatt hour (MWh), unchanged from Wednesday. Off-peak COB was quoted near $18.50. Mid-Columbia firm, peak was quoted $23.50-24.00, down from $25.00-26.00 on Wednesday, as some Northwest utilities sought to undercut Bonneville's offers. Cash COB for December was quoted $25.40-25.80, compared with $23.00-$23.50 on Wednesday. Palo Verde for December was quoted $24.00-24.50, up from $21.75-$22.25. --Los Angeles bureau + 1 213 955 6761
GCAT	A peaceful end to Peru's hostage crisis remained elusive on Monday, as the Peruvian government and rebels failed to reach agreement despite a Cuban offer of asylum for the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas. Government negotiators met MRTA representatives at a Red Cross safe house for the eighth time since the siege began 76 days ago, but talks guarantors said afterward both sides were just digging in behind their bargaining positions. "The commission of guarantors can indicate that both sides are completing their proposals, which without encompassing agreement will clearly establish their positions," Canadian ambassador Anthony Vincent -- one of three guarantors -- told reporters in a prepared statement after the meeting. The downbeat communique was a dash of cold water after a surprise trip by President Alberto Fujimori to the Dominican Republic and Cuba raised the possibility of a Caribbean asylum for the 20-odd hostage takers in a deal to end the siege. The MRTA's European spokesman provided further pessimism by saying the rebels were not interested in asylum. Monday's meeting was carried out in a "cordial" atmosphere, Vincent said, but MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa did not attend. He was represented by his second-in-command, Rolly Rojas. The presence of Cerpa was seen as a positive sign when he first left his stronghold in the captured Japanese ambassador's residence to take part in the fourth round of talks. The talks will continue on Wednesday, Vincent said. Fujimori earlier told a news conference in Havana that Cuban leader Fidel Castro had agreed to grant the guerrillas asylum if all sides agreed to a way out of Latin America's longest-running hostage siege. "Cuba is willing to cooperate in the framework for this asylum but not to participate as a mediator," Fujimori said. Peruvian media reported the Dominican Republic may take six rebels. But the MRTA's international spokesman said the guerrillas would not be lured out of the residence by promises of asylum. "We are not thinking about leaving Peru," spokesman Isaac Velasco told reporters in Pamplona, Spain, where he was attending a book presentation. The heavily-armed Tupac Amaru guerrillas stormed a cocktail party at the residence on Dec. 17. They captured hundreds of hostages, but released most of them to keep 72 heavyweight bargaining chips. Their main demand is the release of 400 jailed comrades. Fujimori has ruled this out, but hinted at other concessions.

CCAT	India's political crisis will hit a keenly-awaited $350 million issue of global equity by the country's largest refiner, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), as crucial reforms are put on hold, analysts said on Thursday. "The Indian government will need to address two key issues before IOC can tap the GDR market -- settlement of oil pool dues and a reforms agenda for the downstream oil industry," said analyst Avadhoot Sabnis at securities firm James Capel B&K. "Given the current political scenario, no action is likely in the immediate future, and the GDR looks delayed until the third quarter of 1997/98," Sabnis said in a note to investors. India was plunged into political chaos on Sunday when the Congress party withdrew crucial support for the ruling coalition. Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, who heads the 10-month-old United Front government, is due to face a vote of confidence in parliament on April 11. "The government is not taking a decision on the price hike. Unless you do that you cannot launch the issue," said Jaspal Bindra, head of corporate finance at UBS Securities. Analysts say an oil price hike is unavoidable to reduce the oil pool deficit, a subsidy the government pays oil firms to compensate them for selling oil in the domestic market below global prices. The oil pool deficit is currently estimated to total around 158 billion rupees ($4.4 billion). Analysts said IOC's issue -- which was due to be launched soon after last month's jumbo offering by the state-run Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd -- would be the only significant casualty of the government's ambitious divestment plan. "If things settle down and the budget gets passed I don't see the divestment programme taking a hit," Bindra said. "It all depends on how quickly the political crisis gets resolved. The only one to suffer immediately will be IOC." India plans to raise $1.3 billion in 1997/98 (April-March) by selling shares in state-run firms including IOC, Gas Authority of India, Modern Food Industries and India Tourism Development Corporation. "From a policy perspective, the one near-term issue which will be affected is that the petroleum price hike will be delayed," said Arup Raha, senior economist at U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong. Raha said it was unlikely that the country's economic reforms programme which marked India's gradual conversion to a free-market economy would be affected. "The current situation is more of a conflict between personalities rather than policies," he said. "If you take a step back and look at the overall picture, regardless of which party comes to power, the economic agenda is set." ($1=35.85 rupees)

GCAT	North Korean leader Kim Jong-il celebrated his 55th birthday on Sunday, but the occasion was overshadowed by the surprise defection of his top adviser, talk of a power struggle and a worsening food crisis. North Korea's state-run media heaped praise on Kim Jong-il and state television, received in Hong Kong, showed happy crowds attending firework celebrations, apparently on Saturday night. Tokyo-based Radiopress news service, which closely monitors North Korean broadcasts, said earlier it detected no "festive mood" in Pyongyang with no major events planned except a gymnastics display by several thousand young people. North Korea's state-run radio stations abruptly cancelled their scheduled live coverage of the event without explanation. Korea watchers in Tokyo believe Kim was forced to scale down birthday functions mainly because of severe food shortages caused by two consecutive years of flooding. "There has been some bad news for North Korea, such as the defection of a top official. But more than anything else, food shortages must be the biggest factor," Shinya Kato, an expert on North Korea at Radiopress, told Reuters. Other analysts say the North Korean leadership could risk a backlash by staging lavish events for the birthday. "It's dangerous to invite tens of thousands of hungry citizens to the North Korean capital," said Nozomu Akizuki, professor of Northeast Asian diplomacy at Tokai University. "You have to remember that people down there are really starving. They could even challenge Kim Jong-il," he said. The defection of top Pyongyang ideologue Hwang Jang-yop has only added to the reclusive Stalinist state's woes. Hwang, 73, was a pillar of the North Korean establishment and a senior aide to Kim Jong-il. He and an aide took a taxi to South Korea's consulate in Beijing on Wednesday and asked for asylum. Hwang remains trapped in the compound as negotiations continue to bring him to Seoul. The defection -- Pyongyang has called it a kidnapping -- has dragged China into a heated row that has bred fears of renewed tension on the Korean peninsula and possibly a disastrous collapse of the communist North. The climate worsened on Saturday when another North Korean defector was shot and seriously injured near Seoul and South Korea said it suspected North Korean agents. A senior Japanese government official said Hwang's defection could set off a power struggle that would lead to more defections, a refugee flight and the ultimate collapse of the communist regime. "Now everyone in North Korea's ruling structure is going to be suspicious of everyone else, as well as their own future, and that could prompt a really destructive power struggle," the official said. Meanwhile, the North Korean media lavished praise on Kim Jong-il and tacitly denied that there was any power struggle in Pyongyang. "Political stability (in North Korea) is founded upon the lofty power of our comrade Kim Jong-il whose leadership position is trusted and supported by our people," North Korea's official newspaper Rodong Sinmun said in Sunday's editorial. Although North Korea's domestic media made no mention of Hwang's defection, a top North Korean official suggested that there were "separatists" in North Korea. "He (Kim Jong-il) has guided all the patriotic forces at home and abroad..., containing the line of confrontation, war and division pursued by the domestic and foreign separatists with the line of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity," Kim Ki-nam, a top ruling party official, told a Pyongyang meeting late on Saturday. Kim Jong-il, supreme commander of the country's 1.1-million-strong military, has yet to be formally confirmed in two key posts held by his late father Kim Il-sung -- general secretary of the ruling Workers' Party and state president.
GCAT	The United States late on Friday vetoed a Security Council resolution drafted by its European Union allies calling on Israel to abandon plans to build a new Jewish neighbourhood in mostly Arab East Jerusalem. The vote was 14 in favour, with only the United States voting against. As one of the council's five permanent members, its negative vote killed the resolution, drafted by Britain, France, Portugal and Sweden. The veto followed a council debate on Wednesday and Thursday in which virtually all the nearly 50 speakers condemned Israel's plan to build 6,500 homes for Jews on a tree-covered hill between East Jerusalem and Bethlehem that Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East war. The site is called Har Homa by Israel and Jabal Abu Ghneim by the Palestinians. Israel regards the entire city of Jerusalem as its undivided capital while the Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. U.S. ambassador Bill Richardson criticised the Israeli action, both during the debate and after casting his veto, saying it undermined trust and confidence so badly needed in the Middle East peace process. But he said the council was "not an appropriate forum for debating the issues now under negotiation between the parties." "Furthermore, this resolution makes sweeping statements concerning the legal status of Israeli settlements, which the parties themselves have agreed are to be treated as a 'permanent status' issue in the talks that are about to resume," said Richardson, whose country is the main sponsor of Mideast negotiations. "I am sorry to say that this resolution would not help move us forward towards our common goal," he added. The veto was the 71st by the United States in the 52-year history of the United Nations. It was the first cast by Richardson, who last month succeeded Madeleine Albright, now U.S. secretary of state, as the American U.N. representative. Richardson told reporters earlier he had tried to get the council to reach consensus on a statement, which carries less weight than a resolution, but that "regrettably, one member of the council did not even permit a discussion of that alternative option." A council source said the member was Egypt. The Palestine Liberation Organisation's U.N. observer, Nasser al-Kidwa, speaking after the veto, said: "In view of the failure of the council to fulfil its obligations, we would request from the members of the United Nations to agree to a meeting of the General Assembly in an emergency session." There is no veto in the 185-member Assembly, whose decisions are not binding. The council resolution would have called on "the Israeli authorities to refrain from all actions or measures, including settlement activities, which alter the facts on the ground, pre-empting the final status negotiations, and have negative implications for the Middle East peace process." It would also have called on Israel to abide scrupulously by its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians in time of war, which bars settlements in occupied territory, and would have urged all parties to press ahead with the peace process. The last U.S. veto was in May 1995, to block a resolution calling on Israel to rescind the expropriation of 131 acres (53 hectares) of Arab land in East Jerusalem. The last time any of the five permanent council members cast a veto was in January this year when China killed a resolution to send U.N. peacekeepers to Guatemala. China objected because of Guatemala's ties with Taiwan, but at a later meeting allowed the peacekeepers to be dispatched. Russia has used its veto 116 times, Britain on 30 occasions, France 18, and China 3.
CCAT	Rank Group Plc said on Monday that it regarded the potential returns on a proposed deal with Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc as inadequate and did not plan further talks on the issue. Trump Hotels said earlier that it had ended talks with Rank to purchase an equity interest in and to change the theme of Trump's Castle in Atlantic City.   "We explored the possibility of rebranding Trump Castle with Hard Rock branding, but having explored fully, frankly the returns as we perceived it just weren't going to meet our criteria," Rank spokeswoman Susan Donovan said. "So we decided not to pursue it any further," she added. Trump said it has pursued alternative re-theming options for Trump's Castle and a decision was expected shortly. --Brian Killen, London newsroom 44 171 542 7972

GCAT	A leading Russian newspaper on Tuesday questioned the Kremlin's haste in promoting without public debate a treaty creating a union with neighbouring Belarus, reflecting liberal concerns about the pact. "They are deciding the fate of Russia behind the backs of the people," liberal daily Izvestia said in the lead headline of its Tuesday editions. "Was it agreement or conspiracy prepared in the corridors of power?" Under the treaty, expected to be signed on Wednesday, the two ex-Soviet states would remain independent but coordinate their foreign, economic and military policies closely. An updated draft of the treaty obtained by Reuters on Monday night was confusing and left many questions unanswered. President Boris Yeltsin gave the green light to the treaty on Monday, and was expected to sign it on April 3 with his Belarus counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, Russian media reported. Russia, a nuclear state of nearly 150 million people, has been working on forming a "community" with its less wealthy western neighbour of about 10 million under a deal signed by the two leaders on April 2 last year. "There will be a union of two states rather then a single state," Valery Serov, Russia's deputy prime minister who co-authored the treaty, told a news conference. The potential transformation of Russia was rushed so quickly that even Yeltsin's allies complained about the lack of debate. "The government's mistake is that it has rather quickly and secretly worked out the agreement and presented it for ratification," Sergei Belyayev, a leader of the pro-government Russia's Choice fraction of parliament, told NTV commercial television. "That's why there emerged more questions than answers." Even Serov's remarks suggested that Russians were confused about the most basic issues related to the treaty. "Some people are asking: 'In what country will we wake up on April 3?'," Serov said. "The answer is: In the very same country you went to bed." Russia's embrace of Belarus comes at a time of increasing international isolation for Minsk. In recent weeks Belarus has cracked down on political dissent, and last week ordered the expulsion of a U.S. diplomat. It has also tried to limit foreign television reporting. Some Russian liberals said they fear the authoritarian Lukashenko, who has lagged far behind Moscow in economic reform, could gain a slice of power at the Kremlin's expense, posing questions about democracy, stability and human rights. Above all, liberals fear Lukashenko could gain jurisdiction over some decisions affecting Russia under a nine-member Supreme Council which will oversee the Russia-Belarus union. However, previous accords on integration have had few practical implications. The latest plans are ambitious, speaking of a union with a joint legal system, joint running of energy, transport and communications systems and a common customs policy. It would also prepare for introducing a single currency. Yeltsin, 66, believes forging better ties with Belarus is a sure political winner since many Russians are nostalgic for the Soviet Union which fell apart in 1991. It could also deflect some attention from Russia's economic woes. But Kremlin sources said Russian officials haggled over the draft in last-minute talks late on Monday. They said liberals, led by first deputy prime ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov, had tried to prevent Yeltsin's approval of the treaty and that divisions had opened in the government. "If the document needs corrections or more work, it's better to do it without hurrying it, so that mistakes are not made," Nemtsov told NTV on Monday night.

MCAT	U.S. Treasuries moved narrowly by midday Tokyo on Tuesday as the market cautiously awaited the release of U.S. retail sales data on Wednesday for clues to whether the recent downward trend would continue, traders said. Light short-covering was detected in thin Tokyo trading, but lingering selling pressure following the bonds' steep fall on Friday was keeping trade in a tight range, they added. A trader at a Japanese brokerage house said market players were hesitant to take biased positions ahead of the data while trying to find out if Friday's nosedive was a temporary retreat from the recent strong rally.
MCAT	A report on the U.S. housing market, an anecdotal account of the nation's business conditions, and a two-year Treasury note auction will be the landmarks of Wednesday's U.S. government securities trading session, market participants said. The December U.S. housing starts report, due at 0830 EST/1330 GMT, is expected to show that starts slipped in the last month of the year after surging in November. December housing starts occurred at an annualized rate of 1.47 million in December, economists said in a Reuters poll.   That rate represents a decline from an annualized 1.514 million starts recorded in November. "Housing starts should be down a little from last month," said Lee Youngdahl, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. "There are no great shakes there. We had a big pop (up) in November. We'll probably unwind a little of that in December, but it's still a healthy level of housing activity." If housing starts fall more sharply than the market expects, "that would be seen as a reason to extend Tuesday's rally," said Chris Rupkey, vice president and economist at Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi.   Bond prices rallied on Tuesday after testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan struck the bond market as straightforward and not alarming. The 6-3/4 percent 30-year bond finished at 96-11/32, up 17/32 to yield 6.79 percent. At 1400 EST/1800 GMT, the Federal Reserve will release its Beige Book, a periodic account of business conditions around the nation based largely on anecdotal observations gathered in the various regions of the Federal Reserve system. "Traditionally, the market doesn't respond much to the Beige Book," said Rupkey.   "The Beige Book shouldn't pose any great surprise," said Youngdahl. "There still will be claims that growth remains moderate, that wage pressures are roughly in check. The Beige Book is kind of a non-event in the scheme of things." The biggest suspense for the session is focused on how much demand the market will generate for the $17.5 billion in two-year notes the Treasury will auction on Wednesday. "The two-year note will be important," said Rupkey, "The pricing will tell us a lot about what people expect for Fed policy in the next two or three months -- certainly through the March 25 FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting."   The two-year notes scheduled for sale on Wednesday ended with a 5.99 percent yield on a when-issued basis on Tuesday, 74 basis points above the 5-1/4 percent Federal funds rate. "If people were really concerned about a tightening in the next two or three months, this spread would be about 100 basis points," Rupkey said. With a closing bond yield of 6.79 percent on Tuesday, a challenge of the 6.75 percent level may be near, Rupkey said. "If we get through that level, it will cause more people to...bet that the next direction is up," he said. Youngdahl was more dubious.   "In terms of the two-year note, six percent to me does not represent significant value considering the fact that the Fed might be engineering one or two (interest rate) tightenings before spring is out," said Youngdahl. Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc, said that with Greenspan's testimony ended and bonds left unrattled by it, the two-year note sale could go very well. "The increase in prices we saw on Tuesday suggests a bit of an upbeat mood in the market," said Moran. "I think it will be a good auction at current levels." Dealers indicated that Federal funds would open between 5-1/4 percent and 5-5/16 percent on Wednesday. (( -- North American Treasury Desk 212-859-1679 ))
ECAT	The consumer price inflation rate in Hong Kong fell to 4.9 percent in August, its lowest level in nine years, the government said on Monday. Consumer Price Index (A), the territory's most widely used inflation measure, fell sharply from the 6.1 percent increase recorded in July. "This is the lowest inflation rate recorded since July, 1987," the government said. Inflation fell across the board and was reflected in a decline in all three of the main indices, CPI(A), CPI(B) and the Hang Seng CPI. The composite CPI also fell, to 5.4 percent in August from 6.2 percent in July. "Looking forward, this is a plus. Hong Kong is getting its costs under control," said Andrea Cheng, economist with Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong. Comparisons with the inflation rate at this time last year are unavailable following a rebasing of consumer price indices earlier this year. Food and housing costs showed the sharpest decline, although price increases in durable goods, meals bought away from home and miscellaneous goods also fell. Economists said the figures confirm that an economic recovery is in the wind, but warned its pace will be slow. "A slow rate of inflation is a reminder that it will be a slow recovery," Cheng said. "You have to remember that inflation is a lagging indicator and this is more a reflection of a weak economy in the second half of 1995 and the first half of 1996." Eddie Wong at HG Asia said housing costs will continue to depress the inflation rate for the next six to 12 months because of a peculiar Hong Kong feature called rental reversion. Housing costs, typically a major component of most Hong Kong people's pay packets, lag economic conditions by up to two years because that is the usual term of most rental agreements. "The economy is picking up quite rapidly but housing costs are lagging because of rental reversion," Wong said.

CCAT	British railways operator Railtrack Plc is expected to announce later today that it has appointed Gerald Corbett, former finance director of Grand Metropolitan as its new chief executive. Industry sources said Corbett, aged 45, would replace current chief executive John Edmonds who is due to retire six months early this autumn. Corbett was widely tipped for the job in British newspapers at the end of last month, just days after he left Grandmet in the shakeout of top executives following its proposed merger with Guinness. --Greg Mahlich, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
ECAT	Following is a selection of economists' reactions to German industry orders data for February. The data showed a 0.2 pct month-on-month rise versus a 2.7 percent gain in January. ARMIN KAYSER, Economist at Swiss Bank in Frankfurt "It is quite small. The markets had been expecting a somewhat better figure. But nevertheless the numbers confirm that, stripping out all the volatility that is caused by construction, the upward trend is quite steady. This bodes well for the economic recovery in the time ahead. It looks like most of the strength is confined to the industrial and export sectors."   THOMAS MAYER, Senior economist, Goldman Sachs. "The figures are a very pleasing development after the strong growth in January. "The two monthly figures together confirm the impression that the weakness in the fourth quarter is over and that the upwards growth path in 1997 will continue."   ADRIAN SCHMIDT, International economist at Chase in London "They were a bit weaker than the market had anticipated. But they were not that bad. In general, over two months, domestic orders are down a bit and foreign orders are leading the way, but capital goods orders in total have been fairly solid. We had a sharp rise last month so a moderate figure this month is no big deal." -- Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756532
MCAT	NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures were expected to open higher Wednesday following Tuesday's late rally and news that a nuclear unit tripped off line in Louisiana, industry sources said. June over-the-counter trade ranged from $2.33 to $2.35 after settling to the upside Tuesday at $2.309 per million British thermal units. In ACCESS, June last traded 0.1 cent higher at $2.310. "There was a little pullback last night in ACCESS. They're just using any excuse to move higher," one trader said, referring to the outage at Entergy Corp's River Bend plant.   The 936 megawatt River Bend nuclear unit is expected to remain shut for one to two weeks for repairs. Also boosting futures were early cash prices at the Henry Hub, La., in the low-to-mid $2.30s, indicating a gain of at least five cents from Tuesday. Technically, traders pegged resistance in June at the $2.385 contract high. Support was first seen at $2.20, with major buying likely at $2.05 and then along the up trendline around $2.03. In Tuesday's cash market, Gulf Coast swing prices rose another two cents to the low-$2.20s. Midcon pipes were up a similar amount to the low-$2s. New York city gate gas firmed about five cents to the low-$2.50s. Expectations for today's weekly AGA inventory report are about 25-70 bcf of injections, versus a gain of 53 bcf a year ago.

CCAT	Slovenian petrol distributor Petrol said on Monday its 1996 net profit is expected to be 30 to 40 percent below last year's profit of 2.8 billion tolars ($20 million). "Profit will fall mostly because of low petrol prices.... higher exchange rate of U.S. dollar, and increased prices of crude oil abroad," Franci Percic, deputy executive of Petrol told Reuters. The dollar is currently quoted at 140.4 tolars compared to 129.6 tolars at the beginning of 1996, while the annual retail price inflation rate reached 8.6 percent in November. Petrol prices in Slovenia are among the lowest in Europe with 76.2 tolars ($0.54) per litre of unleaded petrol. In November, the government refused to lift petrol prices by the demanded 11 to 20 percent. Petrol prices were already raised twice this year by about nine percent, but the government said it would consider a significant price increase at the beginning of 1997. In spite of the problems Petrol faced in 1996, it expects turnover to jump eight percent to 103 billion tolars ($735.7 million). "In the next year we plan to invest about 85 million marks (7.7 billion tolars) mostly for construction of petrol stations on newly constructed motorways and for building new petrol depos," Percic added. Petrol, which completed its privatisation process in November, is still 15.63 percent state-owned. Percic said Petrol was most likely to list its shares on the Ljubljana bourse in 1997 but did not provide an exact date. -- Novica Mihajlovic, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439

ECAT	China has reaffirmed that it still views as taxable interest on loans to foreign financial institutions in this country from offshore banks, officials and state media said on Friday. China's State Council, or cabinet, has recently issued a directive due to questions about the collection of such tax, the Shanghai Securities News said. "There is nothing new in it (the directive), the rules are already in effect," an official of the State Bureau of Taxation told Reuters in Beijing. "We just want to clarify the situation because some foreign bank branches in China have started to borrow funds from overseas," he said. The tax on interest -- which is in addition to income tax -- is usually 20 percent of the interest total but Beijing would extend a favourable rate of 10 percent to lenders in countries which have a reciprocal tax agreement with China, the official said. Overseas banks extending loans to foreign banks or other financial institutions in China should bear the tax but since many do not have offices in the country, banks in China were asked to pay on their behalf, the official added. China's state banks should also pay tax on interest from foreign loans, though they could enjoy tax reductions or waivers if their loans from abroad were on favourable terms. He said this was aimed at encouraging cheap loans for Chinese companies, though he declined to give further details.
MCAT	Uganda's bourse has finally got a name and trading floor and should begin operations in around two weeks, market officials said on Wednesday. The bourse will be called Uganda Securities Exchange Ltd. Its offices and trading floor will be in the Uganda Commercial Bank building in the capital's commercial district, according to Elly Rwakakooko, chairman of the Stock Exchange Council. Rwakakooko said all legal formalities had been completed and what remained was the signing of documents to make the company a legal entity which should then start business by latest in mid-May. "Certainly by mid-May we should have been a legal entity to start business. There now is no impediment," Rwakakooko said. But market analysts said the new bourse was likely to have little or no business when it opened because the government has sold a controlling shareholding in companies it wanted listed to core investors who may not want to trade the shares. Uganda's Capital Markets Authority has previously named Uganda Grain Milling Co Ltd, Uganda Consolidated Properties Ltd and National Insurance Corporation as the first to be listed. That appeared not to be in doubt, said Rwakakooko. In addition a number of private companies had talked to him about possible flotation of part of their shares on the bourse. "There could be business soon because other than government companies, there are five other companies which want to offload shares on to the market," Rwakakooko told Reuters. "We are also convincing (the) government to let us trade in government securities, treasury bills and bonds," he added. Last month, the Capital Markets Authority licensed seven brokerage companies -- African Alliance Uganda Ltd, PMC (MBEA) Investment Ltd, Stanbic International, Dyer & Blair, Greenland Finance, Crane Financial Services and Uganda Commercial Bank. Rwakakooko did not give an indication of which companies were expected to be the first to be listed on the securities exchange or what levels of growth were anticipated.
MCAT	Delhi shares closed lower on selling by foreign funds and Unit Trust of India, the nation's largest mutual fund, ahead of the end of the settlement on Friday, brokers said. The Delhi bourse benchmark index dropped 4.13 points to close at 772.58.   "Today's activity was mainly of squaring up nature, mostly attributed to tomorrow's ending settlement," said Bharat Bhushan of brokers Nu-Era Security. Reliance Industries fell 2.55 rupees to 271.25.

MCAT	Croatian stocks closed mixed on Thursday on lower turnover and analysts expected relatively slow trade with some gains in blue chips in the days ahead. "This will be so until the political situation becomes more clear," said Zoran Ilic of Consult Invest brokerage. But he expected an increased interest for food processor Podravka and confectioner Kras to push their prices up. Only three of eight active issues rose, four fell and one was flat. Turnover shrank to 2.6 million kuna from 7.7 million. Podravka was the most active stock with 1,510 shares sold, inching up eight kuna to 228. Kras gained 10 kuna to 410, with 652 shares traded. "These two will play the major role on the market," Ilic said, predicting that trading with drugs firm Pliva and Zagrebacka Banka entirely depended on developments in London. Both were on the losing side in Zagreb as their GDRs dipped in London. Pliva lost 430 kuna to 13,020 and only sold six shares. Zagrebacka edged down four kuna to 1,000, with 1,326 units sold. Its E-series were flat at 430 kuna on volume of 76. Top gainer, climbing 40 kuna to 1,050, was hotelier Laguna -- the only issue in its group to resist the downward trend while two other stocks, Istraturist and Suncani Hvar, fell. Ilic predicted possible further losses in hotel stocks during the coming Christmas season. Istraturist was the top decliner, down 40 kuna or 22.2 percent to 140 on volume of 170 shares. Suncani Hvar inched down eight kuna to 50, with 323 shares sold. Second tranche of public debt refinancing bonds traded at five percent above par, down from 5.35 percent last week, on turnover of 2.6 million kuna.
CCAT	China property developer Shenzhen Zhenye Co Ltd said on Thursday it would make a three-for-10 rights offer at 12 yuan per share. Zhenye has set a March 27 deadline for registering the rights offer, and the company's A shares would go ex-rights the following day, the company said in a statement in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times. It said it has appointed Shenzhen J&A Securities Co as chief underwriter. Analysts said the issue was aggressively priced because Zhenye's stocks were trading at 15.87 yuan per share, up 1.05 yuan, at 11.05 a.m. (0305 GMT). "J&A must be very confident about Zhenye's future," Song Bin, analyst at Central-South Securities Co, told Hong Kong-based newsletter China Securities Bulletin. A spokesman for J&A said it set the price at this level because Zhenye needed the expected 480 million yuan rights proceeds to buy land and other property companies. "If investors looked at where the proceeds are going, they would know the company has bright prospects," J&A spokesman Chen Jintang told China Securities Bulletin.   Zhenye said it would channel the funds into residential projects and the acquisition of two property firms. Zhenye has 135.62 million outstanding shares made up of 51.23 million legal person shares -- or shares held by government-related institutions, and 84.39 million A shares, the statement said. Zhenye reported net profit of 70.32 million yuan for 1996, up 55.09 percent from 45.34 million yuan the previous year, on strong sales of its property projects in Shenzhen. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)
CCAT	Frontier Corp said on Tuesday that it expects to report fourth quarter earnings per share from recurring operations in the range of $0.30 to $0.34 in the fourth quarter. According to First Call, the consensus estimate for Frontier's fourth quarter is $0.40 a share, compared with $0.36 a share the previous fourth quarter. The company said it expects long distance revenue in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $400 million and below current analysts' expectations.   Frontier said that the quarter will also be hurt by additional selling, general, and administrative costs incurred to better position the company for future growth. According to the company, long distance revenue in the fourth quarter has been affected by a disappointing response to the company's re-marketing of its "dial-around" service. It said that long distance revenue has also been hurt by faster than expected migration off the company's network by the company's largest wholesale customer and slower growth of enhanced services with the customer.   A delay in prepaid calling card program distribution and lower customer retention primarily in the wholesale and consumer segments was also cited. Frontier said it had anticipated that increased revenue from prepaid services would begin to have a positive impact on revenue in the fourth quarter, but it now anticipates that the revenue impact from previously signed contracts will be realized beginning early in 1997. The company said it is targeting earnings growth from recurring operations to be around 10 percent for 1997.
GCAT	France flew fresh troops into the Congolese capital Brazzaville on Monday and airlifted more than 350 foreign nationals out of the city, where rival political and ethnic militias fought for a fifth successive day. Bodies of dead fighters and civilians killed in crossfire lay untouched on the streets where they had been shot. Western military sources said there seemed to have been a slight decrease in the level of combat, but both small arms and mortar fire continued in different parts of the city. "The positions of the two forces are roughly where they were on Thursday, with each side holding part of the city," one said. Fugitives from the pre-election fighting say it appears to be more widespread than in 1993, when 2,000 people were killed in clashes between political and ethnic militias in the capital following disputed parliamentary elections. French troops evacuated foreigners to their military base and four French military Transall planes left the city carrying about 90 people in each and heading for Libreville in Gabon. Diplomats said around 300 French and other foreign nationals were waiting to be evacuated at two hotels in Brazzaville. A new contingent of 150 French troops arrived in the former French colony's capital on Monday to join 450 already there. The French defence ministry said it was increasing to 800 the number of troops it was sending -- up from 500 initially planned. A spokeswoman said 400 soldiers were flying from mainland France and another 400 from Chad. "We'll have 1,200 men on the ground tomorrow," she said. Fighting in the run-up to a July 27 presidential poll pits soldiers loyal to President Pascal Lissouba and their militia allies against ex-president Denis Sassou Nguesso's political militia. Lissouba's government accused Sassou Nguesso on Sunday of trying to stage a coup. Sassou Nguesso pleads self-defence. He says Lissouba fomented the violence to postpone the election. Sassou Nguesso told Reuters by telephone he remained open to dialogue but not with Lissouba accusing him of staging a coup attempt. "I am open to all negotiations, but I reject negotiations on an erroneous basis," he said. Sassou Nguesso said he had respected a night truce at the request of Bernard Kolelas, Brazzaville's mayor and head of a committee trying to mediate. "We saw that Lissouba's militias were not respecting the ceasefire, so we responded," he added. Sassou Nguesso said his forces controlled the northern suburbs and part of the city centre and would do all they could to help France evacuate foreign nationals. In the Bacongo district, the fiefdom of Kolelas's militia, which has so far been neutral in the fighting, witnesses said a shell had landed killing one person. One shell landed across the Congo River in Kinshasa, capital of Laurent Kabila's Democratic Republic of the Congo, exploding in the garden of a Nigerian diplomat. There were no injuries and minimal damage, witnesses said. France's decision to send more troops followed the Saturday death of a French soldier in a firefight and reports from French nationals who fled the city of hostility towards them there. South African oil and chemicals company Sasol Ltd said it had evacuated its four staff because of the violence. There was no clear idea of numbers of dead or wounded. Clashes began on Thursday after soldiers enforcing a ban on private militias surrounded Sassou Nguesso's house. Sassou Nguesso, a former Marxist military leader, was named president in 1979 but voted out of office in 1992 after the advent of democratic reform. Kolelas was runner-up to Lissouba.
MCAT	German equities treaded water at higher levels in afternoon electronic trade on Tuesday, with dealers looking around for significant new data to help the market find new direction. At 1422 GMT the IBIS DAX index stood at 3,342.96 points, up 14.55 points or 0.44 percent, stuck in the middle of a narrow trading range which saw it reach a high of 3,357.75 points and a low of 3,325.75 points. "It's all a bit drifty this afternoon. We had a busy morning with lots of corporate data, but this afternoon the index is virtually unchanged," said a Frankfurt broker.   The strongest gainer in afternoon IBIS trade was Deutsche Lufthansa AG, which was up 1.07 marks, or nearly five percent, at 23.10 marks in late trade. Dealers said that there was positive sentiment in the market on the course of the airline's privatisation programme, while other dealers said that there were technical reasons for the share's upward mobility. Also performing strongly in late electronic trade was chemical giant Hoechst AG, which was up 1.93 points, or nearly three percent, at 66.90 marks.   Dealers said that Hoechst stock had underperformed its counterparts in the chemical sector for some time, and was undergoing a delayed reaction. They said the stability of the dollar also helped. it reported a 54 percent jump in first quarter pre-tax profits to 181 million marks on sales rising almost as strongly to 1.03 billion marks. Preference shares in SAP were up 6.40 marks, a rise of 2.20 percent, at 297.50 marks, in late trade. Electronics giant Siements was also higher.   Siemens was up 1.05 marks at 90.80 marks, off earlier peaks, amid high market expectations of strong first-half 1996/97 figures when the group reports on Wednesday. The market was further underpinned by a stronger opening on the Dow Jones Industrial index, while weaker-than-expected inflation figures from North Rhine-Westphalia underpinned sentiment. -- Clifford Coonan, Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
MCAT	Australian markets, like markets around the world, will be dominated this week by the outcome of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday. There is little of interest locally to distract markets from Fed watching. Wednesday's appearance by new RBA Governor Ian Macfarlane the key scheduled event on the domestic calendar. U.S. Treasuries and U.S. dollar trade was subdued on Friday ahead of the FOMC meeting with traders having either squared up or already taken their positions. The Dow Jones index closed stronger, up 20.72 points, ending three days of losses. Ahead of the FOMC meeting, trade is expected to be cautious. The outcome remains in doubt, with a hike of 25 points seen as the most likely outcome, although many analysts expect any hike to be held over until the November meeting. The local highlight is Wednesday's maiden speech by Ian Macfarlane as RBA govenor. Macfarlane will be appearing in Canberra with ex-RBA head Bernie Fraser and UK Treasury Permanent Secretary Sir Terence Burns on a panel to be chaired by Treasury Secretary Ted Evans. The topic of the panel is "Fiscal and Monetary Policy Indeterdependance and Central Bank Independence," and Macfarlane will delivered a prepared speech. While the U.S. is expected to raise rates, if not this week then in November after the Presedential election, local sentiment still favours another rate cut this year. One data release that may receive greater than usual attention given the market's bullish mood on rates is Thursday's job vacancies data for the three months to August released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). "The ABS's quarterly job vacancy series provides the most statistically reliable guide to future employment growth," Commonwealth Bank economist Tim Moloney said. "To date markets have paid it less attention than they prehaps should," he said. The stalling in the labour market was a key factor behind the RBA's decision to cut rates on July 31, and markets grow more confident of another rate cut with each sign of continuing labour force weakness. The data is expected to show a fall of about five percent, but forecasts range up to a 10 percent fall. Car registrations data for August are due on Friday. Forecasts centre on a rise of 3.9 percent for the month. BONDS: (Friday: 10 year bonds 7.97 percent, 3-year 7.08) Local bonds should start the week on a cautious note ahead of the FOMC, with the potential to continue their recent out-performance of the U.S. market. With the absence of any major local data this week, the market will be focussed on the FOMC meeting. The U.S. bond market has talked about nothing else in the last few weeks as it debated whether the Fed will tighten policy, and in that time local bonds have generally shown a tightening bias on a spread differential basis. The Australian/U.S. 10-year bond yield spread touched its lowest level in over two years last week at 106 basis points. Analysts believe that given Australia's current positive fundamentals it can ride out any storm from the U.S. if the Fed does hike rates on Tuesday. Some economists also believe that a 25 basis point rise in U.S. interest rates may even be taken positively by U.S. Treasuries as it would be seen as a pro-active move by the Fed to contain inflation. "A rate hike would show that the U.S. is very serious about inflation," said State Bank of New South Wales chief economist Hans Kunnen. Such a response would also help the local debt market. "If U.S. bond yields fall, Australian bonds will follow," Kunnen said. "With inflation low in Australia and the economy stalling, bond dealers need little encouragement to buy." AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR: (Friday: US$0.7915/20, NY $0.7912/17) The Australian dollar will start the week above US$0.7900 after holding reasonably steady in New York trade, but it remains vulnerable to the downside after failing to break past resitance at US$0.7950. As with other markets, the lack of domestic data means the major event of the week is the FOMC meeting. If the Fed does hike by 0.25 point it would trim the local dollar's yield advantage and leave it very vulnerable to a possible easing in domestic policy later this year. However, dealers felt that as long as the hike was only 0.25 point, the AUD's yield advantage would still be enough to attract Japanese investor demand and should therefore limit the dollar's downside to US$0.7865 or so. If the Fed restrains itself, there was scope for the currency to re-test 80 cents again, although analysts reckoned world commodity prices were not yet buoyant enough to justify levels much above there. Macfarlane's comments on Wednesday will be dissected for any clues to his stance on monetary policy -- he is thought to be more of a hawk on inflation than his predecessor. AUSTRALIAN STOCKS: (Fri: All Ordinaries 2240.8, down 6.3) Wall Street's 20.72 point rise on Friday, ending three days of losses, should be supportive of local markets, although the All Ordinaries has under-performed the U.S. recently. The All Ordinaries lost 11.5 points over the week to Friday. While the FOMC will also give the local market a lead, metal prices remain the key for the market. "The resources are likely to be the stronger influence over the short term as commodity prices are being watched very closely," one Sydney-based broker said. Copper fell again on Friday, ending under the US$1,900 per tonne support level in LME trade. Aluminium also touched a 2-1/4 year low of US$1,403, and although it managed to end at $1,412, traders said it was likely to fall below US$1,400 soon. BHP chief executive John Prescott said in a weekend tv interview he would not describe himself as bullish on the copper price. "I think it's fallen a bit further than it would have had it not been for (the) Sumitomo incident, but we have to learn in these circumstances to live with lower copper prices for some time and I'd regard any short term spikes as just that." Brokers said lack of local data and the end of the reporting season were seen keeping trade fairly quiet this week. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
ECAT	Hungary is back on track to resume economic growth in 1997 while maintaining tight monetary policies after two years of stagnation, ING Barings said. "In our view, increased political consensus and determination to remain on track with economic reforms should continue in 1997/98 and Hungary could potentially join the ranks of the 'soaring eagles' of Central and Eastern Europe," ING Barings said in a research report on Hungary. It said GDP growth would be driven by "higher export growth, a moderate recovery in private consumption and stronger investment". But the report cautioned that "over the medium term, the Hungarian economy shows considerably lower growth prospects than other Visegrad countries. "Despite annual productivity growth of over 10 percent, low domestic savings and investment ratios, in addition to reduced public spending, continue to limit the country's growth potential." The securities firm said that after a drop in real GDP growth to 0.5 percent in 1996, the economy could grow by a moderate two percent in 1997 and 3.5 percent in 1998. At the same time, a shock austerity programme introduced in March 1995 to tackle inflation, soaring budget deficits and the current account deficit, has begun to bear fruit, ING Barings said. It predicted that year-on-year inflation would be just below 20 percent for 1996 and could dip to 16 percent in 1997. Meanwhile, as economic growth recovers, the current account deficit could grow from 4.0 percent of GDP in 1996 to 4.8 percent of GDP in 1997. @ "Improvements in the invisibles will partially offset the widening trade deficit, which is expected to increase to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1997 from 5.1 percent of GDP in 1996," the report said, citing growth in tourism as a major contributor to improvements in the current account. The report said cuts in government spending were in part offset by high social security costs. It also said Hungary's spending targets for this year would be adversely affected by a 50 billion forint transfer from the government to the central bank to compensate for losses related to the bank's sterilisation actitivities. @ "Offsetting these items, however, will be higher-than-expected corporate and import tax receipts in the central budget which, supported by a relative improvement in the cost of debt servicing, will result in a central budget deficit of 150-170 billion forints, well below the targeted 232 billion." The report said Hungary's competitiveness within the region, which had been cast into doubt by relatively high wages, had been restored by a cumulative real wage fall of 15 percent since early 1995. @ -- Michael Roddy, Budapest newsroom ++36 1 327 4040
CCAT	Investment house Williams de Broe said on Thursday that it has bought 14 percent of one of the leading dairy products firms in the Baltic state of Lithuania, Rokisku Cheese. Williams de Broe Baltic equities chief Petri Karjalainen said Rokisku was the leading cheese maker in the Baltics and Russia. He would not reveal the price of the shares. "We are very excited with its prospects for exports for its cheese products, which are first class," he told Reuters. He said the company hoped to export to the other Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia, Russia and the United States. The company was formed in 1964, privatised in 1991-93 and was now 100 percent privately-owned. The other investors in the company are all local Lithuanians, Karjalainen added. He said the Williams de Broe investment would give the company a tax break as any foreign investment over two million dollars earned tax privileges in Lithuania. Williams de Broe last year bought a stake in Estonian drugs firm Tallinn Pharmaceutical and is active in all the Baltic stock markets. -- Riga Newsroom, +371 721 5240
ECAT	Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said on Tuesday the federal government would no longer be borrowing any new money in the financial markets by 1998/99, which, he asserted, would mean a balanced budget by international standards. "The OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) measures deficits on a national accounts or borrowing requirements basis. By this measurement -- the same measurement as is used in the United States, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy -- our budget in 1998/99 will be balanced," Chretien said in a speech in Montreal.   Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin has forecast a deficit of C$9 billion in fiscal 1998/99 (April-March), but a zero borrowing requirement for that year. In his speech, Chretien said that by getting Canada's fiscal house in order his government had created an investment climate with low interest rates and low inflation. He said that should give investors the confidence they need to create jobs and get a good return for their money.   Chretien appealed to potential investors to help Montreal, Canada's second largest city, back on its feet economically. He said Montreal has always been a symbol of Canada at home and abroad, but it is suffering economically because of a flight of businesses and investment. "Today...Montreal is in trouble. There is too much unemployment, too much poverty. When Montreal is in trouble, the province of Quebec is in trouble and so is all of Canada," Chretien said. The threat of another referendum on Quebec separation soon after the next provincial election "is not conducive to maintaining or attracting investment to Montreal today." Quebec's separatist government has said it intends to hold another referendum on sovereignty, but not until after the next provincial election, which could be held as late as 1998. -- Reuters Montreal Bureau 514-985-2434
CCAT	BOC Group Plc launched on Thursday a breathable, liquefied version of air which could create temporary cold stores in minutes and provide super-cold conditions for testing aircraft engines. BOC said the product, which is a mixture of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen, was the first gas of its kind that could be breathed safely and represented a major breakthrough. Food retailers had already shown great interest in the gas, which would allow companies to turn anything from giant warehouses to small rooms into temporary chilled stores without using massive refrigeration equipment, it said. "If you need a cold store for one day a week or two hours a day then there is some technology to do it," said BOC managing director of technology Deb Chatterji. Possible uses for the gas, which was developed in Britain and the United States, were endless. "The only limit on this is the limit of our imaginations," he said, adding that annual sales could eventually "be north of 20 million pounds ($32.40 million) and south of 200 million pounds". BOC had originally wanted to find a way of enabling refrigerated lorries to keep their loads cool over "multi-drop" deliveries, which meant finding a gas that someone entering the back of the lorry could breathe. People cannot breathe liquid nitrogen, the current mainstay of refrigeration. A number of companies including Air Products and Chemicals Inc of the U.S. are believed to have studied the complex storage problems created by liquefied air, which has a temperature of minus 191 degrees centigrade. However, BOC is the first to launch the gas commercially. It has already been tested on poultry farms, where it dramatically cut death rates caused by high summer temperatures. BOC said it could eventually be used to air condition spaces like rock concert venues and to create extreme-temperature test chambers for the aerospace and other high-tech industries. Britain is being used as a commercial test-bed for the gas, and BOC said it would make a decision about expanding production and overseas marketing at the end of the year. --London Newsroom +44 71 542 7717 ($1=.6172 Pound)
CCAT	Kazakh Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin said on Wednesday that the creation of a new state oil company in place of the former Soviet republic's energy ministry would not affect existing joint ventures. "In no way can this even be suggested," Kazhegeldin told a news conference in the Kazakh capital Almaty, responding to investors' fears that the new state company, Kazakh Oil, might adversely affect the operations of existing ventures with foreign oil companies. Investors in the oil-rich Central Asian state have been worried by a shake-up in the government, in which Kazhegeldin appeared to have lost out in a struggle with the country's oil barons over the pace of privatising the energy sector. Of particular concern was the creation of a new state-owned oil company, Kazakh Oil, in place of the ministry of oil and gas. Kazakh Oil would hold 40-50 percent stakes in all energy ventures. The former oil and gas minister and new head of Kazakh Oil, Nurlan Balgimbayev, and oil enterprise directors oppose foreign control of the industry.   Kazhegeldin said existing deals with oil majors like Chevron Corp, Amoco Corp and Mobil Corp would not be affected by the restructuring. "The government had many different holdings and we are now putting them under the control of one company," the prime minister said. -- Chris Bird, Almaty Newsroom +7 3272 509410
GCAT	Refugees from Zaire, including unaccompanied children, are crossing the border into Zambia in a steady trickle but it could swell to a flood if there is a fight for the city of Lubumubashi, U.N. officials said on Wednesday. An officer of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, said the agency would brace for up to 10,000 refugees if government troops and rebels clashed over Zaire's second largest city. "We anticipate that, in the worst possible scenario, around 10,000 Zaireans could cross the border from around Lubumbashi," UNHCR protection officer Ron Mponda said. "On the other hand, the influx of refugees could remain at the same level as now," he added. Mponda said there had not been a significant increase in the number of Zaireans crossing the border from Lubumbashi since rebels started moving closer to the city. "They are still coming in in trickles," Mponda said. Recent arrivals from Zaire included 17 unaccompanied children, and a number of fleeing government soldiers. "The number of soldiers that has come in is less than 100, and most have handed over their arms to the local authorities," Mponda said. Zambia has granted some 3,000 Zaireans asylum since the rebels started their campaign in eastern Zaire in October 1996. Several hundred Zaireans who crossed the border were granted passage to safer areas in Zaire.
MCAT	CSCE world sugar futures climbed to the day's high on late-session speculative short-covering, but the May contract failed to rally to its overhead target. Still, today's close just below the high of 10.92 sets the stage for additional gains next week, market sources said. May ended up 0.14 cent to 10.90 cents a lb, having ranged from 10.92 to 10.77. The back months settled 0.07 and 0.11 cent higher. Volume was estimated at only 10,890 lots compared with Thursday's official 20,214 lots. Trade buying in the May/July spread and outright local buying in May was cited throughout the session. "We've been down for a few days with plenty of opportunity to wash out the tremendous spec long position, but the short covering has been overwhelming," a broker said. The failure of May to sink below support on Thursday sparked early gains. While several players had anticipated a run-up to 11.00 cents, scale-up trade selling provided firm resistance at the highs. After attempting to overcome 10.89 cents several times during the session, the May contract slipped over the key level late in the day. The trade continued to provide resistance at each point higher and limited the rally at 10.92 cents. Analysts said near-term resistance in May can be found at 11.00 cents and then at the recent high of 11.09 cents. Prices are expected to hold their current trading range amid a dearth of fundamental news. Longer term, the May contract is seen falling to 10.50 cents on ample world supplies. Players await the commitment of traders report released tonight. ((Suzanne Rostler, New York Commodity Desk, 212-859-1640))
MCAT	Kate Kelland European debt futures breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday as the prospect of higher interest rates in the U.S. was pushed down the line, analysts said. While German Bund futures led the way with a 23 basis point jump higher at the open, French and Italian debt futures powered through to set new contract highs. "There is a bit of relief out there," said Jonathan York, a futures broker at Cater Allen on London's LIFFE floor. "There is a good atmosphere and things are looking quite nice for now," he said.   Analysts said the respite for U.S. debt -- which gained on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve decided to keep U.S. monetary policy on hold -- may be shortlived, but they said European bonds may be able to bask a little longer. "The fact that they haven't raised rates in the U.S. is slightly inflationary at the long-end, said Norman Beauchamp, head of derivatives at Cooperative Bank in London. "Once the initial euphoria has gone, the U.S. (market) will come down." After a strong opening, German Bund futures held their ground in early trade. They were trading 22 basis points higher at 98.39 by 0719 GMT.   French December notionnel futures set a new contract high at 124.40, crashing through the previous 124.26 record with the first trade of the day, while Italy's December BTP contract replaced Tuesday's record high with another at 119.90. British gilts had a slightly more moderate start as domestic political concerns kept a cap on their gains. December gilt futures were 7/32 higher at 107-22 by 0733 GMT. Players said positive sentiment was evident on the LIFFE trading floor, since many had said before the key U.S. policy-setting meeting on Tuesday that any move on interest rates would be a very close call.   The latest poll of views, conducted by Reuters on Tuesday, showed that a slim majority of economists -- 31 of 55 surveyed -- had expected the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to raise the 5.25 percent federal funds rate. U.S. December T-bond futures gained almost one full point to a high at 109-00 on the news, but later recoiled to close 17/32 higher at 108-20. By 0746 GMT on Wednesday the futures contract was quoted 4/32 down at 108-16 in automated trade. "If you take away Fed tightening for now and it gives a slightly softer tone to the dollar, European bonds can certainly do well in the short term," said economist Andrew Bevan.   "Really this is another nail in the coffin for talk of higher interest rates in Japan and even of Bundesbank policy starting to turn," said Bevan, Goldman Sach's senior bond economist in London. But analysts said the outlook for European debt further out and towards the end of this year was less chirpy. "The U.S. market will come to the conclusion that the Fed is behind the curve," said Bevan. "And when that happens it is going to be difficult for European bonds too." -- Kate Kelland, International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 8682
CCAT	Most U.S. commuter airlines have implemented higher safety guidelines that mirror those followed by major carriers, the Federal Aviation Administration announced Friday. Thirty-three out of 39 commuter carriers have adopted the new guidelines in an "unprecedented timeframe," the FAA said in a statement. The remaining six carriers are working with the FAA to certify their total 13 aircraft under the higher safety standards. "This rule sets new standards that will help us keep pace with the rapidly growing commuter segment of the aviation industry," acting FAA administrator Barry Valentine said. "This industry's outstanding performance demonstrates its commitment to safety." Under the FAA's new commuter rule, turbojets and passenger planes with 10 or more seats are operated under the same safety guidelines. Previously, there was a separate set of rules for commuters with 10 to 30 seats and another for planes with more than 31 seats. The higher safety guidelines adopted in December 1995 include certified dispatchers and dispatch systems, safety officers, ground deicing programmes, operations and flight attendant manuals and carry-on baggage programmes. The new safety standards are expected to cost air carriers about $75 million over 15 years. The cost to passengers is projected at 30 cents per ticket on planes with 20 to 30 seats and 62 cents per ticket on planes with 10 to 19 seats.
MCAT	The Bank of Italy said it called a 6.5 trillion lire repurchase tender for today for government securities to be resold on April 1. At the previous five-day operation for 8.5 trillion lire on March 12, the minimum accepted rate stood at 7.41 percent and the average rate at 7.42 percent.
MCAT	U.S. Treasuries were steady in quiet London trade on Friday after an early tick down on the softer dollar, traders said. Analysts expected little upside to the market ahead of Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting (FOMC), the prospect of which was keeping ivestors firmly sidelined. "The Treasury market may have to make a concession between now and next Tuesday," said Phil Tyson, international economist at HSBC Markets here. "So the additional upside to the market is limited given the scaling back of tightening expectations recently...and I would favour a downside bias ahead of the meeting." By 0955 GMT, the 30-year T-bond was at 96-31 to yield 6.86 percent, from 97-00 in Tokyo and 96-30 at the New York close. One dealer said there had been some demand for five-year paper, which was at 100-16, unchanged from Tokyo and up from 100-15 in New York. "We took a little down trade early on because of the dollar, but trade is very light," the dealer added. The dollar came under renewed pressure in early European trade after a bout of short covering overnight. By 1007 GMT, dollar/yen was at 115.40/50. Tyson said he still expected the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point next Tuesday. He said Thursday's 31,000 drop in jobless claims suggested the U.S. labour market was fairly tight. "So this leaves us comfortable with our expectation of a 25 basis point rise in interest rates next week." Tyson said April housing starts data due at 1230 GMT would likely have little impact on the market. He expected the data to come in at 1.5 million, slightly higher than the consensus estimate of 1.43 million. "There won't be any huge impact on the market, but it will help our view of a more downward bias to the market next Tuesday," he said. The University of Michigan May consumer sentiment index is due at 1400 GMT. Forecasts were for a slight tick up to 101.6 from 101.4 previously. By 1031 GMT, the June T-bond future was unchanged at 110-10 in automated trade. -- Jennifer Scott, International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 8682

ECAT	Following are comments from U.S. economists after the Labor Department reported that November producer prices rose by 0.4 percent after a 0.4 percent rise in the prior month. Experts had expected producer prices to advance by 0.3 percent in November. DAN SETO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, NIKKO SECURITIES CO INTERNATIONAL INC: "The core performance was actually pretty good. We had a 0.1 percent increase, so I suspect that after some initial fluctuations, the market will probably come to find comfort in this number."   WARD MCCARTHY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, STONE & MCCARTHY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES INC: "The report is not too bad. The overall rate was a little spunkier than expected. Car prices were at the heart of it. The core rate showed its lowest year-over-year rise since July 1994. That's indicative of generally soothing inflation numbers."   RAPHAEL MARRONE, MONEY MARKET ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE MORGAN GRENFELL: "Its a good core number, that is what the market will be looking at. It will discount the (overall) number which was up 0.4 percent. Energy was up 2.3 percent, so that is the main contibutor. "The report showed inflationary pressures in the pipeline are minimal. The overall outlook is that producer price inflation is well-behaved and any pressure that is out there is narrowly confined to the energy sector."   MICHELLE LAUGHLIN, CHIEF TREASURY MARKET STRATEGIST, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES INC: "It's a neutral number -- still consistent with a fairly benign inflation outlook. "We didn't see a reversal in auto prices as we had feared. So you end up with a number close to trend. "Energy prices continue to be a little bit of a problem. I think we'll some moderation, but it might not happen until we get into early 1997. We continue to see a pickup in oil prices into December, so it continues to be a nagging problem."   DAVID WYSS, RESEARCH DIRECTOR AT DRI/MCGRAW HILL: "Generally, the core rate should be the headline, it's not but it should be, and that is up 0.1 (percent), which should be good news for the market. "The core rate is up 0.6 percent on the year; I mean there is no inflation out there except for food and energy. And the big energy price increase I believe is temporary -- oil prices have soared. "It should be good news bond market."   DAVID SLOAN, SENIOR ECONOMIST, I.D.E.A. INC: "The rise (in the November PPI) is led by energy. Elsewhere the figures were pretty soft. Given that oil prices have come off their highs, there's little to be alarmed about in these figures. The core PPI was up 0.1 percent, which is pretty good given the fact we got a 0.5 percent rise in car prices, which are volatile. Excluding cars, there's very little inflationary pressure (in the core PPI). "On the three-month trend on core PPI, really the trend in the core rate is running at an increase of less than 0.1 percent a month. "The PPI at the crude stage of production was up 0.8 percent but ex-food and energy, prices at the crude (early) stage of production were down 0.3 percent. As far as the intermediate stage of production, there's little inflationary risk there as well." -- N.A. Treasury Desk, 212-859-1660
GCAT	Stress, cold and diarrhoea have hit hundreds of impoverished Thai protesters who are camping outside Government House in the capital demanding social justice, relief officials said on Thursday. The sick are among 10,000 villagers who streamed into Bangkok from northeast Thailand last Friday and vowed to remain in make-shift shelters on two roads flanking Government House until their demands were met. "About 300 patients turn up for first aid daily," a nurse assigned to look after the villagers told Reuters. She said more than 10,000 pills had been handed out daily to the sick. "At least six people who suffered from stress have been experiencing psychiatric problems and two of them were sent to hospital for treatment," she added. Some of the villagers, who also cook food on the streets, complain they face severe problems with water and toilet facilities. The government has provided some mobile toilets but villagers said the facilities were inadequate. "Hundreds of people have to line up for a few mobile toilets every morning and it is getting worse because a neighbouring turf club closed off its toilets to us," said Kamsaeng Meekratok, a protester from Khonkhaen province. The club, near Government House, allowed the protesters to use its toilets for a while but has now posted a sign saying the facilities are closed for renovation. "Maybe the villagers have already filled up its toilet and that has forced the club to shut it down," Kamsaeng said. But despite the hardships, the villagers have pledged to push ahead with their marathon protest. Organised by a movement called the Assembly of the Poor, they want to be released from indebtedness to the state-owned Agriculture and Cooperatives Bank, higher prices for their tapioca and settlement of land disputes with the government. The Assembly's delegates met Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh on Monday and have held several rounds of negotiations with government officials this week. But there is no sign of an end to the dispute. "The problems being discussed are complicated and it involves many state agencies and law. So we need some time to reach agreement," said Chingchai Mongkoltham, minister in the prime minister's office, who is chairing the talks.
ECAT	India's inflation rate is well under control and the nation's central bank is carefully monitoring prices, a senior Finance Ministry official said.   Finance Secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia said in a statement in Paris which was released in New Delhi on Wednesday that monetary and credit policy for 1997/98 (April-March) seeks to contain M3 growth within a target band of 15 to 15.5 percent. Money supply growth as measured by M3 is currently running a little higher than projected because of the continued buoyancy of reserve inflows, Ahluwalia said. "But inflation is well under control, and the Reserve Bank of India is carefully monitoring developments on a continuous basis," he said.   "Furthermore, there is the welcome sign of a downward trend in the rates of interest," he said. "While inflation was on a downward trend in 1995/96, the rates of interest were slow to adjust and, in real terms, the rates of interest had become somewhat high creating problems for businesses as well as problems of adverse selection in the allocation of bank credit," he said. "I am happy to report that the real interest rates have come down significantly since October 1996," he said. Ahluwalia was speaking at the India Development Forum in Paris which ended on Wednesday. --New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024

ECAT	Russia's 1997 gross domestic product is likely to be unchanged on 1996 levels and annual inflation will fall to 11 percent from 22 percent, a senior government official said on Thursday. State Statistics Committee First Deputy Chairman Valery Dalin told a news conference that by the committee's estimates 1997 industrial production volume would be unchanged or one percent higher than 1996 levels and GDP would be unchanged. He said annual inflation would amount to 11 percent. The 1997 budget foresees a 12 percent inflation rate. The government, which until recently had been forecasting growth of up to two percent this year, now concedes that the economy will not grow significantly until 1998. Dalin said the situation in the first four months of 1997 was stable. "Stabilisation and depression are one word for the same phenomenon," Dalin said. "But stabilisation has a more optimistic feel." In the first four months of 1997 GDP was unchanged year-on-year. Dalin said industrial production, trade and transportation volumes rose by 0.5 to one percent, while agricultural production fell by six percent and construction volumes fell by four percent year-on-year. Investment fell by eight percent, he said. Dalin said tax arrears had fallen to over 60 trillion roubles by the end of April from 118.8 trillion roubles at the start of December, 1996. Dalin said the committee had changed its estimate for the share of the shadow economy in GDP to 25 percent from 22 percent, but said changes had not had a material impact on the GDP figures. Earlier this year the committee reported modest year-on-year growth rates in GDP, which economists said was partly due to the shadow economy estimate revision. --Julie Tolkacheva, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520

MCAT	--------------------------- Oct 18 ------------------------- *Banks stay within Central Bank's desired range ------------------------------------------------------------ The Philippine peso closed lower on Friday at 26.273 pesos to the dollar from 26.271 due to an interest rate arbitrage play for the weekend, traders said. "This is the usual weekend play," said a foreign bank dealer. The dealer said banks were selling dollars for same-day delivery so they could have the pesos that earn higher interest during the weekend. At the same time, banks bought dollars for delivery Monday to cover the dollars they sold.   The peso, however, was pulled down as banks took into account the swap points as a result of the interest rate differentials between the peso and the dollar during the weekend, traders said. The peso fell to a day-low of 26.279 pesos before recovering some ground at the close due to inflows of money for portfolio investments, traders said. The day's average was 26.275 from 26.265, with turnover falling to $104.50 million from $177.50 million. The Central Bank was not seen intervening in the market as it traded within its desired range of 26.24 to 26.28 pesos, dealers said. - LILIAN KARUNUNGAN (632) 841-8937

CCAT	IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said on Monday it had assigned the Russian bank Unexim (United Export Import Bank) with long-term BB, short-term B, individual C/D and legal 2T ratings.   (Following is the full press release.) LONDON, June 2 -- IBCA, the European credit rating agency, has assigned the following ratings to the major Russian bank Unexim (United Export Import Bank): Long-term BB, Short-term B, Individual C/D and Legal 2T. This is the first 2T Legal rating that IBCA has so far given for any Russian bank, and reflects Unexim's importance in the banking community and economy, as well as its size and connections with the government. Unexim has a special place in the Russian banking system, being one of the major lenders to the Russian government, regional administrations and several major industrial companies. It is currently involved in attempting to ease the payment crisis in Russian industry where companies are often unable to pay neither each other nor their taxes, thereby creating budgetary problems for the Russian government. The bank is also involved in promissory note schemes issued to companies, most of which are guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance. IBCA notes that asset quality has been acceptable compared with many Russian banks', probably reflecting Unexim's concentration on larger companies, although the payment crisis and arrears makes the solvency of Russian corporates difficult to determine. The bank is accredited to the EBRD's/World Bank's FIDP Programme, has credit lines from international lenders, has received SEC recognition for custody services, and has opened a Swiss subsidiary, Banque Unixem (Suisse) SA. At end-1996, the capital ratio, calculated in accordance with Basle G10 requirements, was 13% and a share issue of USD100 million is planned for 1997.

ECAT	Romania, negotiating fresh IMF credits, is to be allowed to extend its ceiling on external debt by $500 million to $3.7 billion, the Fund's chief negotiator for the country said on Wednesday. "The ceiling on external borrowing is going to be increased by half a billion dollars," Poul Thomsen told reporters after the centrist government approved a revised budget maintaining a deficit level approved by the Fund. Thomsen, who has led a month-long mission assessing the government's reform programmes, gave no details on what the increased funding might be used for. Thomsen praised the government's achievements in reducing inflation, stabilising the leu currency, improving the foreign trade balance and increasing foreign exchange reserves. But he sidestepped questions on whether he would recommend to the IMF Board agree to release the second of five $86 million tranches under a 13-month stand-by arrangement. "As far as macro-economic policies are concerned, developments have been very positive. They are exceeding expectations," he said. He said he had to return to Washington and "convince my colleagues that we have an agreement, which is a good agreement and I expect the Board to discuss it in early September." If the Board put off the discussion until later, he said, "this is not a lack of support. It's a problem of scheduling."   But he urged the government to move more quickly to restructure or close down loss-making companies in energy-intensive sectors. "The key of sustainability is to accelerate reforms of loss-making reforms in energy-intensive sectors," he said. "We have to focus now on taking the hard and difficult decisions to start dealing with those big loss-making enterprises that are putting pressure on macro-stabilisation." Inflation is expected to have fallen to less than two percent in July from more than 30 percent in March after prices were liberalised. The central bank has announced foreign exchange are expected to rise to between $3 billion and $4 billion from $1.6 billion at end-July. But ministers acknowledge that revenues from privatisation have been low and that limited progress has been made in shutting down or restructuring lists of chronic loss-making industries and farms.

ECAT	India must speed its reforms prgramme in order to attain high growth and attract investment, a senior official of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) said on Friday. "If India is to attain the growth path of seven percent and to receive $10 billion in direct investment...it appears that renewed emphasis needs to be given to the reform programme," WTO deputy director-general Chulsu Kim told an international conference on Asian economies.   "The acceleration of reform would be necessary to overcome the recent slowdown of exports and industrial production, and overcome the serious infrastructure bottleneck faced by Indian companies," Kim told the conference. He recommended an elimination of quantitative restrictions on consumer goods imports and a further liberalisation of the foreign investment regime. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, who unveiled a market-friendly budget a week ago, said in a newspaper interview on Friday that liberalisation of consumer goods imports would help boost India's "sluggish" import growth and increase customs revenue. "It is viable and necessary to open up consumer goods imports. Opening up of imports is good in itself. It is an advance on trade policy," he said.
GCAT	President Bill Clinton said on Tuesday he had decided to postpone a trip to Latin America scheduled for May until later in the year because of his injured knee. Speaking at a White House event on health care, Clinton said he would visit Mexico, Barbados and Costa Rica in May. He had been due to visit Mexico April 11-12, but the Mexican foreign ministry said Tuesday this had been moved to May 6-7.   Clinton's visits to Barbados and Costa Rica, originally scheduled for the extended Latin America trip in May, would be combined with the Mexico trip and take place May 6-10, the White House said in a statement released after Clinton spoke. Clinton, who tore a tendon in his right knee on March 14, will visit Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela Oct. 12-17, the statement added. The Latin America trip had been scheduled for May 6-13. "Later in the year, we're going to go to South America and do that trip when I'm somewhat more mobile," added Clinton, who is on crutches as he recovers from knee surgery. "Among other things we're going to Argentina and Brazil, they're big countries, there's going to be a lot of moving around and I need a little more physical mobility," he said. "Besides, I'm hoping to ride horses and do some other things and I'm not quite ready for that as you can see."

MCAT	Implied volatilities for dollar-pair options soared as the spot greenback extended recent gains in very choppy trading, dealers said. They said the dollar's bull trend had yet to run its course and volatilities were likely to stay firm for a while. The dollar rose past last week's peaks to touch a fresh 47-month high above 121.50 yen and a 31-month high of 1.6570 marks earlier in the day before pulling back slightly. Shorter-dated options, which have higher gamma values, attracted the strongest bids due to the dollar's rapid advances.   "At this point, it just seems to make sense to be long a lot of gamma," said a trader at a U.S. bank in California. "Your time decay can be covered by intra-day delta-hedging without a whole lot of trouble in this kind of market." Delta-hedging is selling or buying of spot dollars to maintain a position delta-neutral, or immune to the underlying market's directionality. A long-gamma trader, by trying to stay delta-neutral, would be selling spot dollars at highs and buying at lows -- a profitable operation provided the spot market makes enough fluctuation to beat the steeper time decay associated with high-gamma options.   One-week volatilities for dollar/yen and dollar/mark stood at 12.2/13.2 and 11.0/12.0 percent respectively, both up by more than a full point from Monday. One-month dollar/yen stood at 10.9/11.2 percent, up nearly a full point, while one-month dollar/mark was at 10.6/10.8 percent, up 0.3 point. Both dollar/yen and dollar/mark volatility curves were fairly steeply inverted, and traders predicted they would stay inverted until the spot market calmed down. "No one is brave enough to try and short the front end right now," said a trader at a European bank in Chicago.
MCAT	Shanghai copper futures ended mixed in dull trading on Thursday with most investors taking a wait-and-see attitude, traders said. The most active April 1997 contract ended at 21,470 yuan ($2,587) per tonne, losing 10 yuan. It opened at 21,450 yuan, hitting an intra-day low of 21,400 and a high of 21,560. January rose 10 to 20,800, February fell 20 to 20,920, March was down 60 at 21,190, May increased 10 to 21,570 and June 10 to 21,600. Combined volume fell sharply to 25,560 from 105,050.   Copper opened mixed and moved around the opening levels for most of the session. Traders said investors were waiting for further market-moving news, with few daring to build large long positions. "Thin volume indicated many investors are sticking to the sidelines," a trader said. Traders said some long liquidation emerged on the market given the the lack of further rises on the London Metal Exchange last night after gains in the previous session.   "There was no further positive market-moving news after the sharp gains on Wednesday, resulting in some profit-taking on disappointment," a second trader said. "Many investors doubt if copper will maintain an upward trend in the short term with the approach of the Chinese lunar new year holiday," he added. Traders expect Shanghai copper to follow the LME's trend in the next few days due to the absence of domestic market-moving news.   Aluminium ended sharply up. January rose 380 to 14,530 yuan per tonne, February 410 to 14,810, March 260 to 15,210 and April 410 to 15,650. Combined volume rose to 3,040 tonnes from 800.

CCAT	Investors from Mexico and abroad have shown strong interest at the start of the process to sell off troubled bank assets, a source close to the deal said on Monday. "Even though we're not allowed to say how many buyers there are of the (information) packages, we can say that it has been above expectations, that the information has been bought and that a lot of foreign groups have shown a great interest in taking part," the source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. The deadline for buying the packages with details of the 150 million pesos of assets initially up for sale is June 13. They represent the opening salvo in the government's sale of some 42 billion pesos of loans bought or seized off banks during the recent financial crisis. The sale is being handled by an agency known as the Valuation and Sale of Assets (VVA). The sole winner of the first 150 million peso package is scheduled to be announced on July 9.

ECAT	Ministers from some 150 countries gather in Singapore next weekend for talks that could determine whether the world pushes on towards global free trade or slides into a new era of protectionism and competing power blocs. And signs are already flashing that the week-long meeting, the first Ministerial Conference of the two-year-old World Trade Organisation, will be far from the trouble-free encounter for which its organisers had prayed. After weeks of discussion and days and nights of often fierce argument over the text of a final declaration for Singapore, ambassadors to the Geneva-based WTO threw in their hand last Friday and passed the problem onto the ministers. Their failure means the gathering will almost certainly witness a degree of North-South confrontation that bodes ill for hopes of a fresh impulse to more freedom in world trade. At the heart of the debate are issues that have long divided major developed and developing countries -- trade and labour standards, textiles, the awarding of government contracts, or procurement, and the corruption this often involves. Others -- like national investment and competition policies designed to favour local firms, and when to get started on new global talks aimed at wider openings to agricultural trade -- cut across traditional North-South fault lines. But there is a more general disagreement -- on whether, as developing countries want, the ministers should focus on ensuring what was agreed in the 1994 Marrakesh world trade accord is being implemented rather than adding "new issues" to the the WTO's agenda as big powers would like. Also hanging in the air is the the proliferation of regional trade groupings, which could threaten the cohesion of the WTO and the global rules it was set up to administer, and of when the big absentees -- China and Russia -- might come in. Both, with nearly 30 other countries in the WTO waiting room, will be in Singapore along with the 125 current members of the body -- created in the 1986-93 Uruguay Round negotiations to replace the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero argues that the declaration should be a ringing affirmation of the ministers' determination to keep working through the organisation to bring down barriers to trade into the 21st century. He fought hard to get a text completed for the Singapore meeting -- from December 9-13 -- that would have more or less satisfied everyone and kept a common thread of accord. Ruggiero, and many analysts with him, fears that unless the free trade momentum is kept up anger among workers and farmers in North and South at the perceived effects on their jobs of the growing global market will overwhelm the politicians. The dilemma is that while North and South agree on where they ought to be heading, they differ sharply on how to get there and how fast they should be travelling. The governments of industrialised and developing states recognise they need to trade increasingly with each other  -- in both goods and the booming services that make up one third of world commerce -- to ensure their peoples' economic progress. But big power policy-makers -- especially in the United States and the European Union -- are under heavy pressure from economic and political protectionists who think tariff walls and last-ditch defence of "national sovereignty" can stave off the negative effects of globalisation. Increasingly, governments in the North feel the need to prove to sceptical labour and environmental lobbies that the WTO is not just working to the benefit of big multinational companies active across the global economy. So many richer countries, led by the United States, argue the WTO must address in some way the question of how far lower wages and scanty social protection in developing countries produces an unfair trade advantage in the form of cheaper goods. A U.S. push for the conclusion of a global deal in Singapore abolishing tariffs by the year 2000 on information technology products is partly driven by concern to show that freer trade can have a job pay-off in domestic "hi-tech" industries. Governments of developing countries face their own domestic sceptics on free trade and the value of the WTO, as protests in Manila during last month's meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) showed. And many of them -- especially the key Asian emerging economies -- feel the industrialised powers are not doing enough to meet their concerns, particularly in opening up for textiles and clothing, so refuse to budge on the "new issues." Despite U.S. and EU protestations to the contrary, they see the labour issue as a device to provide the big powers, under cover of the WTO, with an excuse to shut off access for even more their goods to the North American and European markets. They also argue that efforts by the EU to start talks on competition policy and by Canada and Japan, backed by Brussels, to discuss investment policy in the WTO are largely aimed at a total takeover of their domestic economies. There seems little room for compromise in Singapore, with key countries on both sides hinting that they would rather have no overall agreement -- and declaration -- at all rather than give in on their core demands. But one key envoy in Geneva voiced cautious optimism. "We here could not make the political decisions that were needed. When faced with the alternative, the ministers will surely find a way to keep the trading system on the tracks," he said.
GCAT	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Monday the United States would accept the verdict of Mexican voters who dealt their country's ruling party its worst setback in seven decades in power. Early results in Sunday's elections showed that President Ernesto Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) lost its 68-year grip on the lower house of Congress, and was also trounced in the first race for Mexico City mayor this century. "I think that the issue here is one in which we will obviously accept the verdict of the people of Mexico," said Albright, visiting Madrid for a NATO summit on Tuesday. "It is our custom that we respect the votes of the people in countries where they elect their legislatures or their presidents," Albright told a news conference after talks with Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes. "We also have quite a lot of experience in dealing with countries where there is divided government, including our own," she added drily. Zedillo, whose policies have been heavily backed by the United States despite major economic and drug problems in Mexico, was not up for re-election.
MCAT	China's A and B shares ended sharply higher on Monday on a rebound after recent government anti-speculation measures led to sharp losses, brokers said. The Shanghai B index surged 3.178 points, or 3.66 percent, to 90.045 on turnover of $14.593 million, as local investors spilled over from the active domestic A share market, pushing volume significantly higher than last Friday, they said. The Shanghai A index soared 53.477 points, or 3.99 percent, to 1,395.339 on turnover of 8.46 billion yuan and the SSE30 blue chip index climbed 126.967 points, or 3.21 percent, to 4,080.126. "Institutions were active, which boosted follow-up buying and pushed the market up late in the session," one broker said. "There are signs that the market has started another run-up after consolidating at around 87 points for some time," another broker said. "The B share market will see 100 points this time if there is no major negative news in sight in the near future," he said. The Shenzhen B share index jumped 7.18 points, or 4.69 percent, to end at 160.26 on turnover of HK$93.2 million against Friday's HK$61.2 million. The domestic A share index leaped 22.61 points, or 5.09 percent, to 466.52 on turnover of 8.2 billion yuan. "Investors have stepped into the market in the final weeks before the Hong Kong handover on the assumption that the government would not crack down on the markets at this important time," an analyst at China Guotai Securities said. The British colony reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30. Beijing's measures to cool the markets in early May sent the A and B share markets into a tailspin. The indices had been up more than 50 percent from the beginning of the year. "But this is a rebound from heavy losses rather than the start of a new bull run," said an analyst at J&A Securities. Analysts said they expected choppy trading in the near future as volume rises. China Merchants Shekou Port Holdings Co Ltd was the best performer on the Shenzhen B share market, gaining HK$0.42, or 9.86 percent, to HK$4.68. The A share market leader Shenzhen Development Bank, which has been under investigation for alleged stock trading misconduct, was the most actively traded stock with volume of 21.2 million shares. It rose 1.18 yuan to 34.82 yuan. Shanghai Dazhong Taxi was the best performing Shanghai B share after the firm's shareholders approved a 10-for-10 bonus issue. The stock surged $0.168, or 10 percent, to 1.848 on volume of 586,700 shares. Pudong real estate company Shanghai Jinqiao Export Processing Zone Development was the most actively traded issue. Aided by institutional buying, it rose $0.05, or 6.94 percent, to $0.77 on volume of 2.2 million shares. ($1=8.3 yuan, $1=HK$7.8)

ECAT	Pakistan can meet its budget targets in fiscal 1997/98 (July-June) only if it curbs its fiscal deficit, analysts said on Wednesday. "If the government can control the fiscal deficit within the five percent target, all other targets will follow suit," Kalim Aziz, head of research at ING Baring Securities, said. A deficit target of five percent of gross domestic product is likely to be the cornerstone of next year's budget, to be presented on Friday. This year's deficit is expected to be at least as wide as last year's 6.3 percent of GDP. Officials say the goal can be achieved through deep spending cuts and extra revenue from the economic growth they expect to flow from tax and tariff reductions unveiled soon after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif swept to power in February 3 polls. The economy, hit by slow agricultural growth and industrial recession, has shown few signs yet of responding to Sharif's supply-side measures, which will need time to make an impact. Meanwhile, analysts say, it is vital to keep the fiscal deficit in check to avert the need for expensive government borrowing and in turn restrain inflation and production costs. "If inflation is controlled it will reduce the differential between domestic and international prices and will cut the trade and current account deficits through higher exports," Aziz said. Jahanzeb Naseer, research head at Jardine Fleming Pakistan, said revenue collection would be the key factor in deciding whether the government could meet its other budget targets. He said Sharif's supply-side measures were steps in the right direction, but a contingency plan should be ready in case the government faced a cash crunch before the strategy paid off. Local newspapers say the budget will fix a revenue target of 325 billion rupees ($8.026 billion), well below last year's original target of 340 billion, but higher than actual 1996/97 collection, thought unlikely to exceed 290 billion rupees. Nadeem Naqvi, head of research at International Asset Management Co Ltd, said tax collection machinery needed to be overhauled if next year's revenue goal was to be met. A report by the International Monetary Fund has told the government that plans to impose sales tax at the retail level stand little chance of success without more preparatory work. Naqvi said the government would find it hard to slash the spending side of the budget. "With three quarters or more of revenue going into debt servicing and defence, even a nominal cut in expenditure will be very difficult," he said. Naqvi advocated a bold cut in military spending, a sensitive area given the power of a defence establishment that can point to Pakistan's standoff with India to justify its cash demands. Analysts say the government might sanction a modest nominal rise in defence outlay, slightly reducing it in real terms. Naseer said tax cuts and reductions of tariffs on raw material imports, designed to boost exports beyond $9 billion, would lower production costs and should stimulate industry to switch to production of higher value-added items. However, he said lower tariffs would immediately hit customs duty collection, a large part of total revenue. "The measures are not focused enough for an export boost in dollar terms as Pakistan has a narrow export base, mostly comprising the lower segment of textile products," Naqvi said. He said rupee depreciation would fuel inflation, which would in turn make competitive pricing of export goods difficult. Pakistan aims to bring inflation, officially estimated at 13 percent in 1996/97, down to nine percent in 1997/98. Naqvi said this would require drastic cuts in current and public development spending, from which the government might shy away due to their risky social and political consequences.

ECAT	The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment rose 0.2 of a point or 0.2 percent in August to 101.3. Bill Evans, Westpac's General Manager, Economics, said the result is a very disappointing response for consumer sentiment to the 0.5 percent reduction in official interest rates and mortgage rates which occurred about a week before the survey. "In the survey, there was some improvement in consumers' views on the economic outlook, but surprisingly, a fall in their opinions on the state of the family finances both compared with last year and over the next 12 months," Evans said.   Evans said long term trends indicate that concerns with unemployment and the economy are the key factors holding back consumer confidence. "With this relationship in place, we will be relying on a clear improvement in the labour market to spur a sustainable lift in consumer confidence, which will eventually feed through to high consumer spending," he said. Evans noted that consumer sentiment has fallen by 7.8 percent since January, while by August 1993 sentiment that year had fallen 5.0 percent. In both years there were two official rate cuts totalling 1.0 percent by end July, reaching 4.75 percent in 1993 and 5.0 percent in 1997, but mortgage rates are much lower in 1997. Evans said there is evidence from the housing market and the Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index that a recovery in the labour market is probably on the way and a lift in consumer sentiment will follow. "A further reduction in official interest rates will certainly assist this recovery without threatening inflation," Evans said.   "Consequently, Westpac believes that the Reserve Bank will move to reduce interest rates one more time sometime over the next few months, even though there may be some early signs of a stronger economy," he added. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

CCAT	Thai Airways International has switched concentrating its leased freighter on the U.S. market and started a new service to Paris, Thai's cargo director Kawin Asawachatroj told Reuters. Until last month, Thai flew twice a week to Los Angeles and once weekly to Frankfurt with its Boeing 747-200 leased from Atlas Air. With the summer timetable introduction, Thai has now reduced its trans-Pacific service to once weekly and begun a weekly freighter service to Paris as well as continuing its weekly Frankfurt link, Kawin said. Because of aircraft availablity, Thai is also delaying the introduction of a scheduled freighter service between Hong Kong and Bangkok but will increase the number of non-scheduled flights to the territory from this month when the Durian fruit export season gets into full swing. Cathay Pacific is also arranging extra freighter flights from Bangkok to Hong Kong for the Durian season. The distinctive Thai fruit is a traditionally popular delicacy in Hong Kong. Kawin said the changed route pattern should mean Thai should have ground time available to fit in a Hong Kong non-scheduled service to take advantage of a strong export market from Thailand. "We would like to go to various regional destinations but we also have to think about long haul routes. In the short term we won't be starting a scheduled Hong Kong service," Kawin said. Thai is considering how to serve Hong Kong best in the long term that that fits in with the schedule of the carrier's one leased freighter. Thai has plans to operate more than one freighter "but they are still some way off," Kawin said. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 7706 Fax +5017
GCAT	Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk authorised the country's acting head of state to formally appoint Foreign Minister Ung Huot as first prime minister to replace the king's son, the ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh. The king said in a brief message to acting head of state Chea Sim that he should sign the decree appointing Ung Huot if Chea Sim thought it appropriate. "If, in your understanding it should be, you can sign that decree of appointment," the king told Chea Sim in his message from Beijing where he is receiving medical treatment. A copy of the message was released by the palace in Phnom Penh. The constitution requires that a new first prime minister be approved by the king. "He's passing the buck to Chea Sim," said a diplomat. "We know he doesn't approve of what has happened." Ranariddh was ousted by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on July 6 after two days of battles between troops loyal to the rival prime ministers in Phnom Penh. Soon after Sihanouk said he would not sign any decrees on behalf of the new government but authorised Chea Sim to do so. He later said he would not recognise Ung Huot as first premier as the post belonged to his son. The king also said that a vote on a new first prime minister by an incomplete parliament would be invalid. But Ung Huot said on Thursday that he, Hun Sen and Chea Sim would travel to Beijing on Monday for a meeting with Sihanouk the following day. "He will be blessing us," Ung Huot said. Ung Huot also dismissed U.S. concern that his appointment was not democratic and said he expected Chea Sim to formally appoint him as first prime minister later in the day. He said more than 80 percent of FUNCINPEC members of parliament attended the Wednesday National Assembly session which approved his nomination. "If anyone says this is not democratic I say think again," Ung Huot told a news conference. More than two-thirds of the National Assembly members voted by secret ballot to accept Ung Huot's nomination as first prime minister. The assembly also voted by a show of hands to strip Ranariddh of his parliamentary immunity, clearing the way for his prosecution for alleged crimes if he returned to Cambodia. But a U.S. Embassy official said on Thursday that Ung Huot's approval by the assembly and the stripping of Ranariddh's immunity were not democratic given the atmosphere of intimidation in Cambodia. "While we respect Ung Huot as an individual, in the absence of a return by FUNCINPEC members of parliament in exile, and in the current atmosphere of intimidation we do not believe yesterday's votes were democratic," an embassy spokesperson told Reuters. "We hope that FUNCINPEC will revisit this issue when a genuinely free and open environment returns to Phnom Penh," the spokesperson said. But Ung Huot rejected the U.S. worry: "They have to get their information correct for Cambodia," he said. Many supporters of Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party fled the country in the wake of Hun Sen's bloody July 6 takeover and a subsequent crackdown on the party in which some 40 people were killed, according to United Nations human rights officials. Among those who fled were some 20 members of parliament from FUNCINPEC and a small allied party. Ninety-nine of the assembly's 120 members were present for Wednesday's votes. "The king already gave the authority to Chea Sim to sign my appointment," Ung Huot said.

ECAT	Economic confidence among European businesses and consumers improved sharply in February, reflecting stronger orders and better employment prospects, the European Commission said on Monday. In its monthly survey of economic sentiment, the European Union's executive found that confidence was "augmented strongly in February, reflecting improvements in all sectors." The February index jumped to 101.1 from 100.3 in January. In 1996 the confidence measure averaged 98.9. Among the areas showing noticeable improvement was the construction industry, where upbeat employment expectations brought the sector's index to its highest level since December 1995. In Germany, while the overall sentiment barometer rose for a fifth consecutive month, consumer confidence worsened due to growing worries over personal finances and the broad economic backdrop. Germany has been struggling under record unemployment levels, a development that is likely to have contributed to the more gloomy assessment by consumers, officials said. Another factor contributing to the February rise in EU sentiment was the ongoing increase in share prices. While the weight of share prices in the EU index is only one sixth, the sharp rise in European markets since the beginning of the year has nonetheless had a positive influence on sentiment. -- Brussels Newsroom 32 2 287 6800
CCAT	Robinson and Co Ltd, one of Singapore's oldest retailers, does not plan to diversify despite a tough trading climate, senior officials said on Thursday. "We have no plans to diversify outside retail. We want to specialise in retail and don't want to get side-tracked," chairman Michael Wong said at a meeting with the media and analysts. Wong said the group, which operates its own retail outlets and acts as agent for other chains such as Marks and Spencer, had no immediate plans to expand beyond Singapore and Malaysia. The group would be opening a new John Little store in Singapore in November, but did not plan to expand its Robinson's department store. On August 20, Robinson & Co reported a 0.8 percent drop in 1995/1996 net profit to Singapore $25.34 million (US$17.97) on a turnover of S$224.51 million. According to its 1996 annual report, the group had S$149.72 million in cash and cash equivalent. Wong said the group was evaluating proposals by various fund managers on how to optimise returns from its cash pile. "Our returns from retailing are very good...We are examining the opportunites we have. Strategy depends on which funds are more fruitful and profitable for shareholders," Wong said. He did not dismiss the possibility of the cash-rich group paying more dividends to its shareholders. Wong said the group still generated "a positive bottom line" despite vulnerability to rental fluctuations because it leased its retail premises. Chief executive officer Peter Husum said the company's strategy for Singapore had been to operate small- to medium-size outlets and a larger store or two, and it  planned to maintain this strategy. Similarly for Malaysia, the number of smaller outlets would increase as business grew. "It is very important that we are bottom line-oriented and not just concentrate on expanding turnover," Husum said. "We would continue to concentrate on the customer services element and building up our own Robinson's brand and merchandises exclusive to us," he added. "We are focusing on having a clean stock, and target to change the stock level more than four times a year." Husum said about 70 percent of the group's turnover was generated by local customers, with the  remaining 30 percent from foreigners in Singapore and tourists. Wong was confident the group's ability "to squeeze the highest returns per square foot" under Husum's leadership would protect it amid Singapore's retail slump, which saw its latest victim in Lane Crawford Hong Kong-based Lane Crawford announced earlier this month it was closing its store in Singapore's prime shopping district.

GCAT	The AIDS situation in India may spin out of control in the next few years, medical authorities and volunteers fighting the virus said on Sunday. "India has about five million HIV cases right now," said I.H. Gilada, secretary-general of the Indian Health Organisation, a voluntary organisation working against the spread of the virus in Bombay. "By the turn of the century, this is likely to go up to 20 million in a best-case scenario and 50 million in a worst-case scenario" he said. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). There is no cure for AIDS but several have been found to work against HIV. India's commercial capital of Bombay marked World AIDS day with photo-exhibitions about the dangers of the virus, marches sponsored by charity organisations and a "Race against AIDS" organised by music channel MTV and several social groups. Officials say the western Indian state of Maharashtra and Bombay, its capital, with a population of over 13 million, account for the majority of AIDS cases reported in the country. The city's notorious Kamathipura red-light district houses an estimated 70,000 prostitutes in cramped and often unhygienic conditions. "The situation is certainly grave," state health director Subhash Salunke told Reuters. "What is particularly worrying is the number of cases reporting HIV positive," he said. "The degree of HIV positivity among STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease) cases is about 30 percent," said Salunke. "The state is treating it on a top priority basis." Salunke said the state's fight against AIDS focussed on the youth. "We are targeting adolescents and college youths," he said. "We feel that a proper programme of education about AIDS can save the next generation." The state is also concentrating on counselling prostitutes and truck drivers, who constitute a major part of the visitors to Bombay's red-light areas. The current situation is largely the result of official apathy about AIDS, said Gilada. "There has not been enough official attention given to (the fight against) AIDS," he said. "People have sudenly woken up now that the situation looks like getting out of control." Gilada said that by the year 2000 AIDS patients in India alone would require three times more beds than were available for all patients at present. Yet there was some light at the end of the tunnel, he said. "In recent months we have seen that Bombay has been bypassed by smaller cities in the number of new HIV cases being reported. It appears that a sustained programme of education and high-publicity anti-AIDS campaigns does have some impact." While this offered hopes that the spread of the virus could be contained, it also threw up problems of a different nature. Gilada said funding organisations often wanted to see their work attract attention in the media. "It will be more difficult to attract sponsor funds to campaigns in rural and semi-urban areas where the scope for publicity will be less."
MCAT	U.S. debt futures were lower in light, early trade, as the tone remained short-term bearish from Tuesday's sell-off, traders said. "All the important data for the month is already out," one T-bond futures trader said, referring to U.S. May consumer and producer prices. "And I think the failure to test the upside yesterday will keep the bid light today," he said. September T-bonds fell to Tuesday's low of 111-17/32, below trendline support at 111-18/32. One firm bought 500 contracts, pushing September to 111-20/32.   Preliminary open interest on Tuesday declined with prices, but traders attributed the decrease to June T-bonds' expiration on Thursday, June 19. They also said the expiration of July T-bond and T-note options on futures on Friday could sway price action in the futures pits. In the meantime, revised data on U.S. factory orders and first-quarter productivity will be released at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT, and could generate activity. Productivity is expected to rise 2.1 percent, compared to up 2.0 percent, and unit labor costs are forecast to gain 2.6 percent, from up 2.7 percent.   However, traders said the May consumer and producer price data has already convinced the market that U.S. inflationary pressures remain tame. "Even before the numbers, crude oil and the energy complex as a whole are telling you that we're in a low inflationary environment," one T-bond futures trader said. Resistance is at Tuesday's high of 112-10/32, 112-14/32, and at 112-27/32. Support is at 110-23/32, a 38.2-percent retracement level from the contract's rally to 112-10/32 from 108-05/32.   At 0828 CDT/1328 GMT, September T-bonds were off 08/32 at 111-20/32 and December Eurodollars were off 0.025 at 93.925. ((DerivativesDesk(312)408-8750)) E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com

By 0841 GMT, the FTSE 100 was off 14.4 points to 4,341.7, well off the day's low at 4,334.3. The Dow, down 18 points when London markets closed, finished with a 92.36-point loss at 6,927.77. "The feeling is that we are very much at the top of the range and the market is going to be volatile," said one dealer. The 1030 GMT expiry of February equity index options could inject another dose of volatility into UK shares, dealers said.
GCAT	Slovenia, one of Europe's most stable and prosperous ex-communist states, faces an uncertain future following an inconclusive election which gave neither left nor right a clear mandate to run the country. A rightwing alliance, bent on unseating centre-left Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, was likely to be denied an absolute majority in parliament by just one seat. But Sunday's general election also dealt Drnovsek a difficult pack, leaving his Liberal Democrats with most votes but without an obvious coalition partner. The outcome could complicate the former Yugoslav republic's bid to join the European Union, with the right less keen than Drnovsek to join the Brussels club without rock-solid guarantees to protect such sectors as farming. "We are a little worried because the right may slow down the whole process of Slovenia's integration into the European Union," a Ljubljana-based Western European diplomat said. Markets are also worried that the right may put the brakes on an already-sluggish privatisation process and scare off would-be foreign investors. "After being the golden child of transition, people are looking more closely at Slovenia," said Heather Grabbe, European programme research fellow at London's Royal Institute for International Affairs. "Slovenia is doing well but it has a long way to go. Industrial restructuring is difficult...and the EU is paying particular attention to protectionism," Grabbe said. Whether Slovenia would hit its target date of 2001 for EU entry was an open question, she added. The rightist People's Party, the biggest winner among the three parties of the so-called "Slovenian Spring" alliance, has made clear it wants Slovenia's farmers in particular to be shielded from the full rigours of EU competition. Most parties back Slovenia's membership of the NATO military alliance in its first expansion eastwards. Unofficial results gave 45 seats in the 90-member assembly to the alliance, which also includes the centre-right Social Democrats and Christian Democrats. Final official results were expected on Friday. Chances were receding of the right being allocated an extra seat after final calculations in the complicated proportional voting system, pointing to political stalemate. Behind-the-scenes bartering has begun but the rightist alliance was holding firm just a hair's breadth from power. "A right-wing government would be unstable even if it gets a majority," Britain-based Slovenian political analyst Drago Lavrencic said. "There would be a lot of changes in Slovenia if Drnovsek goes." Drnovsek, 46, president of former Yugoslavia between 1989 and 1990, is considered an astute political operator. With 25 parliamentary seats, Drnovsek knows he cannot rule without persuading one of the rightwing parties to defect and join him in a new coalition government. If he does succeed, Drnvosek's new administration would have in any case to shift policy to the right to tackle the big spending cuts and industrial restructuring necessary for EU entry and European economic and monetary union. "If the "Spring' alliance forms a government it will be very fragile and would not last six months and would lead to early elections," said Igor Luksic, professor of politics at Ljubljana University. "But I still think Drnovsek has it in him to win parties over to him and form the next government."

CCAT	MGI Properties said on Wednesday it would book a gain of about $1.45 million or $0.13 per share in the quarter ending November 30, for the sale of a distribution and manufacturing facility in Massachusetts.   MGI said it sold a 77,400 square-foot distribution and manufacturing building in Westwood, Massachusetts, million or about $39 per square foot. It bought the building in November 1993 for $1.52 million or $19.57 per square foot, the company said. Chairman W. Pearce Coues said this was the first sale of a Massachusetts property since MGI began reinvesting in New England and was effected after the tenant in the building renewed their lease at a significantly higher rent level. In addition to the periodic sale of buildings in non-core markets, Coues said MGI might selectively sell properties located in Massachusetts, which have reached a mature value.

ECAT	The International Monetary Fund said on Friday that its executive board had authorised Vietnam to draw another tranche of about $88 million in soft loans after giving an upbeat appraisal of its economic policies. The IMF's Resident Representative in Vietnam, Michael Bell, said the authorisation came after a review of the second annual arrangement under the IMF's concessional Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). ESAFs are funds loaned by the IMF at low rates to low-income countries in return for a pledge to undertake strong policy steps, usually aimed at redressing balance of payments problems. The IMF approved a three-year six-tranche ESAF of about $530 million for Vietnam in November 1994, when it was clear that eight years of reform had already brought spectacular gains. Bell said in a statement the latest credit would bring IMF disbursements since October 1993 to well over $500 million and noted that a further two tranches of $176 million would be available in 1997 under the third and final year of the ESAF deal. He said the executive board carried out its annual review of economic policy against a background of strong growth -- an annual rate of nine percent -- and an inflation rate of less than four percent. The board said a recent widening of the external current account deficit largely reflected strong inflows of foreign direct investment. But it said external financing was sufficient and the country's international reserves had increased. "These economic conditions reflect the authorities' basically sound fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies and provide an opportunity to press ahead with essential structural reforms," he said. He said that in recent months the authorities had taken a number of reform steps, especially in the areas of state enterprises, the financial system and the foreign payments system. Donor nations and agencies are due to gather at a World Bank-chaired meeting in Hanoi next week to consider aid pledges for next year. Official media have reported that Hanoi expects pledges worth $2.8 billion at the meeting. But diplomats have said the figure was likely to be about the same as last year. Aid commitments came to $2.31 billion last year, a rise from $1.9 billion in 1994 and $1.8 billion a year earlier.
ECAT	Investors will not worry about a delay in Manila ending more than 30 years of IMF supervision, as long as the reason for the delay -- Congressional agreement on tax reforms -- is eventually sorted out, analysts said on Wednesday. But political bickering over the crucial tax reform package means a bill cannot get through Congress, as required, in time for the planned exit from the IMF programme on June 23. "What is more important is the fiscal position of the government will remain in positive territory. What is more critical is the passage of the reform programme," ING Barings Securities research head Jose Mario Cuyegkeng. "The exit will follow as long as investors are assured of the sustainability of the fiscal picture," he added. Senate ways and means committee chairman Juan Ponce Enrile said earlier the Senate, due to go into recess on Thursday and reconvene in the third week of July, would only be able to pass the tax reform bill in three months. "We cannot finish it (this week). The most we can do is try to finish it not later than end of August," he told reporters. The bill is the last of a package of major tax reforms since President Fidel Ramos took office in 1992. The bill, which aims to generate 18 billion pesos a year, would expand the number of people who pay income tax and overhaul the corporate income tax structure. The Senate is still deliberating on its bill. One already passed by the House of Representatives gives too many exemptions since Congressmen are jockeying to get re-elected in next year's elections. Analysts, however, warned that a delay in the passage of the last tax component beyond December could result in lower economic growth in later years. "Delays will definitely hamper the growth if they are too long...Initially there may be cutbacks in infrastructure spending," said Philippine TA Securities economist Rolando Valenzuela. Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said the government has not decided whether to let the IMF programme lapse or seek an extension. President Fidel Ramos said last week the government may opt for an extension. -- Manila Newsroom (63 2) 841-8937 Fax 817-6267
GCAT	Pakistan's Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar flew to the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif on Sunday in a new attempt to broker peace talks between warring Afghan factions, a government official said. He said Babar would hold talks with powerful Uzbek militia leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum, and later fly to the southern city of Kandahar, headquarters of Mullah Mohammad Omar, leader of the Islamic Taleban movement. Pakistan has called for an immediate ceasefire and peace talks aimed at forming a broad-based Afghan government. The official said the Taleban had expressed a new willingness to talk to ousted government military chief Ahmed Shah Masood, whose forces were closing in on Kabul on Sunday, just three weeks after the Taleban drove them from the capital. There was no immediate confirmation from the Taleban that they were ready to talk peace with Masood. The hardline Islamists have previously demanded that he "return all government property" -- a reference to Masood's military equipment -- before any talks can take place. "It is a big achievement to get agreement of different factions to sit together and initiate a serious dialogue to bring peace and reconciliation which seemed impossible a few weeks ago," Babar told reporters on Saturday. Despite the peace talks, Dostum's forces provided artillery support that helped Masood's fighters recapture the vital Bagram military airbase, 60 km (40 miles) north of Kabul, on Friday. The capture of Bagram was the first joint operation between Masood and Dostum. But the Uzbek commander did not commit his infantry, in an apparent sign he was keeping his options open. Last week Dostum signed a defence pact with Masood and Shi'ite Moslem Hezb-i-Wahdat faction leader Karim Khalili. Babar, thought to have close links with the Taleban since their abrupt emergence two years ago, arranged the first public contact between Taleban leaders and Dostum on Wednesday. Those talks in Mazar-i-Sharif were followed by a further round in Kandahar on Thursday. The Taleban had previously shunned Dostum because of his service in the former communist government led by president Najibullah, killed by the Taleban after they took Kabul. Babar said on Saturday that there were acute shortages of food, medicine and clothing in Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan facing the onset of winter. "It would be criminal negligence on the part of the world community if they failed to come forward and help the Afghans," he said.

Satellite beacons strapped to the hides of Marguerite and Claudie the cows and Garance the mare enable computer-based herdsmen see whether animals are better than machines or chemicals at clearing mountain pastures. The transmitters show the animals' position to about three metres (10 feet) every five seconds on a mountainside 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) up near Clermont-Ferrand, central France, which is overrun by brambles, weeds and bushes. The animals are among 36 cows and 12 horses in two separate herds in the area being used in the experiment by the National Institute of Agronomic Research (INRA). "This will allow us to see if cows and horses are complementary in their grazing habits," said Didier Micol, an INRA researcher. Farmers have steadily abandoned such upland areas as unprofitable. The dense vegetation that takes over makes the areas inaccessible to walkers and tourists. He said it would be impossible for human herdsmen to keep such close track of the animals as the satellite system, more often used to let ships pinpoint their position at sea. "We thought of putting solar panels on the cows instead of using batteries for the satellite beacons, but it was too difficult," Micol added.
ECAT	The Slovak Finance Ministry said on Wednesday that the state budget deficit grew to 17.790 billion crowns as of July 8 from a deficit of 7.2 billion for the first five months of the year.   Marian Horvath, head of the State Assets and Liabilities Department at the ministry, told Reuters that the ministry was planning to introduce several new measures to help find cheaper funds for covering state budget deficit, which he said totalled 17.790 billion crowns as of July 8, 1997. "We want to widen the range of investors allowed to take part in auctions of state securities," Horvath said. The ministry is now working on a material that should allow companies, or even citizens, to buy both state bonds and treasury bills. -- Peter Laca, Bratislava Newsroom, 421-7-521-8402
CCAT	Shares in Ceska Sporitelna a.s., the largest Czech savings bank, could become a favourite of investors if a solid party emerges to acquire a large minority stake and stresses efficiency, analysts said. But that may take a while. The secretive investment group Motoinvest, which says it has a 10-15 percent stake in Sporitelna, has been unsuccessful so far in seeking a buyer for the shares since last summer. Motoinvest -- which bought shares in Sporitelna, and another bank, Agrobanka a.s. -- has said it would divest its banking sector shares due to the hostility toward it shown by government officials and the central bank. Officials have frequently said the group was unwelcome because of its murky financial and ownership structure. "The Motoinvest case shows how an equity stake has concrete political consequence... there is no seriously interested buyer (for Sporitelna)," Jan Chudomel of Motoinvest told Reuters. The state holds a 45 percent stake in Sporitelna which gives it strong control as some 15 percent is owned by municipalities which lack voting rights. Other owners and their exact stakes are unknown. Analysts have taken issue with the efficiency of the former communist-era savings bank which now has about 1,800 branches thrughout the country, and 19,000 employees. "If a strong, trustworthy and transparent party, preferably experienced in the banking sector, becomes the new owner (of the Motoinvest stake), it will have a significant positive influence on the value of Sporitelna," said Richard Podpiera of brokerage Atlantik Financial Markets. "The current ownership structure doesn't create sufficient pressure on the increase of efficiency," Podpiera said. Josef Kovalovsky, an equities analyst at CSOB, said Sporitelna's management must move to keep its promise to cut a third of its branches, and reduce the bank's payroll. Sporitelna's management has said it would make deep cuts in staff and its branch network, but the results have yet to be seen. A spokesman told Reuters planned redundancies of 5,000 workers would be carried out over a five-year period. "A positive impact would of course be expected if there is not a disintegration of this trend (in cuts)," said Kovalovsky. Sporitelna runs over 2.4 million liquid deposit accounts, according to the bank's own data at the end of 1996. Clients' deposits, at 290 billion crowns at the end of the third quarter, constitute 80 percent of the bank's resources. Sporitelna, still the elephant on the interbank market, cut credit exposure to other banks to 20 percent of total assets in the third quarter of 1996 from 32 percent at the end of 1995. Risky loans to small banks forced the creation of an additional nine billion crowns in reserves in 1995, slashing net profit to just 263 million crowns. Sporitelna set its 1996 net profit plan at 2.1 billion crowns, but analysts are cautious, pointing out the continuing problems of small Czech banks last year. "Due to the problems in the banking sector, Ceska Sporitelna will be forced to create larger (than expected) reserves and provisions," said Marcela Gronychova of OFT Brokers. "That makes us believe that the 1996 profit will be lower (than originally forecast)." Analysts' forecast put 1996 net profit in a range between 1.8 and 2.0 billion crowns. Sporitelna's shares have fallen from the last September's height of 365 crowns to 285 in November, but climbed back to around 325 in the past weeks. The stock closed down five crowns on Monday at 315. Most analysts recommended it as a buy at up to 340 crowns. -- Prague Newsrooom, 42-2-2423-0003
MCAT	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to further ease liquidity, sparking a fall in interest rates and boosting depressed equity markets, bankers and analysts said on Monday. Heads of leading state-run Indian banks meet RBI Governor Chakravarty Rangarajan on October 19 to discuss the central bank's monetary policy for the second half of 1996/97 (April-March). The policy is scheduled to be released on the same day. "The crucial task before the RBI is to lower interest rates," said P.H. Ravikumar, senior vice-president at ICICI Banking Corporation. Interest rates for top-rated borrowers range from 15.5 percent per annum charged by leading state-run Indian banks to 18.5-19.0 percent by private and foreign banks. "Most bankers feel that liquidity will tighten in the months to come and this is keeping interest rates high," he said. "A strong signal has to be conveyed to the market that interest rates are on the downswing," Ravikumar said. "This can be achieved by a cut in the cash reserve ratio for banks," he said. The RBI has already cut banks' cash reserve requirements by two percentage points in the current year, releasing 79 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) to banks. The ratio is currently at 12 percent. Banks are currently enjoying a comfortable liquidity position. RBI data released on Monday showed a deposit growth of 279.26 billion rupees against a 30.66 billion rupee decline in advances for the banking industry so far this year. "In such a situation, if cash reserve requirements are cut further this will be a strong signal to the banking industry to bring down interest rates," Ravikumar said. "A lot is expected of the RBI this time," said K. Kannan, chairman and managing director of state-run Bank of Baroda. "I have not seen expectations of such a high order before." He said the central bank might have to assist in reviving depressed equity markets as this was critical for the government's divestment programme. The government has said it plans to raise 50 billion rupees through the sale of shares in state-owned firms. Analysts feel this is unlikely, given the depressed state of the equities market reeling under fears about political stability and an expected slowdown in company earnings for the first half of 1996/97. The Bombay Stock Exchange's top 30 share index was at 3,100 in late Monday trade, down from a 1996 high of 4,069 on June 18. It touched a record 4,628 in September 1994. "I feel the limits on bank investments in shares and debentures may be increased," said Amit Rajpal, banking analyst at Prime Broking. At present banks are allowed to invest five percent of their incremental deposits each year in shares and debentures of companies. Rajpal said this could be increased to 10 percent, increasing the funds available for investment. ($1=35.65 rupees) -- Bombay newsroom +91-22-265 9000
CCAT	Photocopier giant Xerox Corp., a longtime leader in corporate copiers, Monday unveiled its first product for the home, a $499 combination color printer, copier and scanner for personal computers. Dubbed the Document HomeCentre, the device is aimed at small and home offices, Xerox said. The company also introduced the Document WorkCentre 450c, a device that combines color printing with faxing, copying and scanning and has a retail price of $549. With its new products, the Stamford, Conn.-based company -- long synonymous with photocopying equipment for the large corporate market -- is entering a market now dominated by companies like Hewlett-Packard Co. and Japan's Canon Inc. "We are extremely confident of success," Rosemary Thomas, vice president and general manager of Xerox Channels Group's North American retail operations, said in an interview. "I would just cite what we've done in the personal copier market in the last six years, (in which Xerox) has gone from player number three or four, to number one," Thomas said. "I would expect that we're going to be the fastest-growing entity within the corporation, and, hopefully, the fastest-growing within the marketplace," she said. Xerox set up its Channels Group in May to focus on retail and dealer sales, as opposed to the company's traditional, direct sales force. Thomas said the company expects to increase its retail and indirect channel sales to $4 billion from $1 billion over the next three years. Industry analysts said Xerox's pursuit of the home retail market sales was a landmark event. "This is dramatic, (and) this could mark the beginning of a whole new Xerox," said Kristy Holch, analyst at InfoTrends Research Group in Kansas City. "If Xerox wants to continue growing, they've got to be in those (indirect sales) channels." Holch said the key question was whether Xerox would be able to leverage its famous name for the household market. "Here is Xerox, with this very office, corporate brand, trying to bring a product into the home. That brings with it a host of questions. Even if the product is the right one, is Xerox's organization set up to support that market?" The Document HomeCentre is the more revolutionary of the two new products, analysts said. It creates a new industry category, whereas the WorkCentre 450c is basically a new version of the company's old 250, which stopped production last year. "The 450c is more evolutionary, and the HomeCentre is more revolutionary, in that it is the first product specifically designed for the home, personal use market, and not for business," said Andrew Johnson, analyst at Dataquest. He said U.S. sales of personal color multifunction products should grow to 2.6 million units by 2001 from a projected 510,000 units in 1997. Johnson said he was "very optimistic" about the new products' chances of success. "They're not (known for home products), but they have great name recognition, and it's very much transferable." He added, "I don't think it's a matter of Xerox taking away any sales from Hewlett-Packard or Canon. The market is growing so fast that everybody will be very successful." The launch of the HomeCentre appears well timed, Holch said. "Certain things they've done with the product satisfy some of the requirements for the home -- like ease of use, a reasonable price and versatility." The Document HomeCentre will be available at stores in the United States and Canada early next month, Xerox said. It will be available in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year and Latin America in the first quarter of 1998. The Document WorkCentre 450c will be available at U.S. and Canadian retailers later this month, and will be in Europe and Latin America in the fourth quarter of this year. Xerox stock fell $56 cents to $74.19 in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
ECAT	East St. Louis, an Illinois town that once faced possible bankruptcy, is now facing a $1 million shortfall in its upcoming fiscal year budget, the city's financial oversight official said Tuesday. Bruce Patterson, executive director of the East St. Louis Financial Advisory Authority, said budget requests from city departments are running $1 million more than expected revenues for the fiscal year that begins Jan. 1. Patterson said the city's accounting firm has recommended the layoff of 35 employees to bring the upcoming $18 million budget into balance. The city is scheduled to present a proposed budget to the authority on Nov. 1. "Whether we find (the budget) meets all the criteria is another question," Patterson said. "Before the whole issue is done, there will be a balanced budget." A 1990 Illinois law tailored for East St. Louis' financial troubles created the authority to oversee the city's finances. The authority will continue to approve the city's budget, payments and contracts until the city ends 10 consecutive years with a balanced budget, according to Patterson. So far, East St. Louis has completed three years of balanced operations, he said. A $21 million 1994 bond issue backed by Illinois' moral obligation pledge enabled the city to restructure its debt. In addition, the arrival of a riverboat casino injected a new stream of revenue into the city's coffers. However, the city's share of tax revenues from the casino, which opened in June 1993, is showing signs of stagnation, according to Patterson. He said estimated revenues for fiscal 1997 from the casino should remain at the fiscal 1996 level of $10 million. "So the days of rising revenue and greater discretion of spending are ending now," he added. --Karen Pierog, 312-408-8647
ECAT	Argentina's industrial output rose between seven and nine percent in the third quarter compared with the same period last year, a senior Economy Ministry official said Monday. "All the industrial production data are pointing to between seven and nine percent growth in the third quarter compared with last year's," chief Economy Ministry advisor Carlos Rodriguez told reporters.   "The (industrial) sector recovery is a fact ... It is not a one-month statistical phenomenon, " Rodriguez said. Lower interest rates and higher peso deposits are also pointing to an economic recovery. "This is indicative of consumers' confidence," Rodriguez said. September's official industrial production figures are due on October 29. Argentina emerged in the second quarter from a year-long recession induced by the "Tequila effect" produced by the Mexican peso devaluation that jolted most emerging markets. -- Patrick Adam, Buenos Aires Newsroom +541b 318-0654
ECAT	Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Friday the government wanted to reform the tax system now partly because of the country's currently low inflation rate. "One of the reasons why we are embarking on it at the present time is that when you have a very low rate of inflation it is an extremely good time to be examining fundamental changes to the tax system," Howard told a meeting of pensioners.   Howard promised the pensioners that any tax changes would consider the position of people on fixed incomes. Howard announced on Wednesday his government would draft a tax reform package over the next few months, aimed at a new broad-based indirect tax and cutting income taxes. The move is widely seen as leading to a goods and services tax -- a tax on consumption -- which many economists believe would have an initial impact on inflation. The consumer price index inflation measure fell 0.2 percent in the June quarter for an annual inflation rate of 0.3 percent. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730
GCAT	South Africa will field a youthful and inexperienced team against Ghana in Pretoria on Saturday as coach Clive Barker continues to experiment with his squad. The two countries meet in the final match of the Four Nations Cup tournament with South Africa needing just a draw to win the week-long tournament. Barker, whose team won their first two matches against Kenya and Australia, said on Thursday he would start with several of the fringe players who had not had an opportunity to play in the friendly international tournament so far. Only a heavy defeat would deny South Africa the trophy, even if Australia beat Kenya handsomely in Saturday's other match on Saturday. South Africa top the standings with six points from two matches with Australia and Ghana tied in second place on three. Kenya have lost both their matches and are out of contention. "It's the perfect opportunity to give some of the others a run. There should be a few more new caps," said Barker, who has used seven new players in the tournament already. "If anything this tournament has made it a lot more difficult for me when I have to pick my squad for the World Cup qualifiers. I won't know who to leave out. I think I might just take the selection announcement week off," he joked. South Africa meet Zaire in the opening World Cup qualifying match in Johannesburg in November and the Four Nations Cup is designed as a warm-up for that game. Ghana coach Sam Arday said on Thursday he was hoping to reinforce his team for Saturday's match but would not disclose any details. His squad at the tournament has been without almost all Ghana's leading European-based professionals. Australia will be without defender Tony Popvic, sent off against South Africa on Wednesday, for their match against Kenya. Tournament rules stipulate a one-match suspension for a dismissal. Kenya are also depleted with the early departure of three key players who will be in action for club side Kenya Breweries in a Confederation of African Football (CAF) Cup match in Sierra Leone this weekend.
GCAT	Romania's presidential run-off vote on Sunday pits incumbent Ion Iliescu against centrist rival Emil Constantinescu -- two politicians with radically different views of the country's future. Iliescu, in power since the 1989 fall of communism, held a slim lead over Constantinescu in the first round of polls earlier this month, 32 percent to 28 percent. He defeated Constantinescu in the 1992 election. But for the first time in seven years of power, Iliescu looks isolated on the political scene. His leftist Party of Social Democracy, defeated in the parliamentary polls this month, is the only major force backing him for a new term. Here are profiles of the two contenders. ION ILIESCU, 66, President of Romania, is an ex-communist who won power by masterminding the ousting of Stalinist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in the 1989 revolution. He was confirmed as president by a landslide 85 percent in elections in May 1990 and re-elected in September 1992. Moscow-educated Iliescu is the candidate of the leftist Party of Social Democracy, successors of the communists. Iliescu says he offers stability and cautious economic reform to protect Romanians from the pain of change. His opponents say the man who was once heir apparent to Ceausescu is a remnant of an old order mired in corruption. They say he lacks the vision to guide Romania into the next century. Iliescu has moved to the political centre in recent years. But his foes recall the coal miners' riots of 1990 and 1991, which toppled reformist Prime Minister Petre Roman, and say it is evidence of an authoritarian streak. Iliescu, favorite among less educated rural people, won the first round with 32 percent, but was defeated in towns and the capital Bucharest, where his rival led by 17 percentage points. - - - - - EMIL CONSTANTINESCU, 56, is the candidate of the Democratic Convention (CDR), a centrist opposition alliance, which won the country's third parliamentary elections earlier this month. A geologist and law faculty graduate, he rose to political prominence because of his untarnished reputation. Although Constantinescu had little experience of top-level politics and was soundly beaten by Iliescu in 1992 he has grown in self-confidence during the 1996 campaign. Slim, soft-spoken and bearded, he was among teachers who joined students on the streets in the December 1989 revolution. He also joined a protest movement which was bloodily crushed by pro-Iliescu coalminers in June 1990. Constantinescu's American-style "Contract with Romania" promises swifter social, economic and political reforms, guarantees of the rule of law and a fierce attack on corruption and abuse of privilege. Constantinescu got 28 percent of votes in the first round, less than his CDR, which leads in the two parliament houses -- in the lower Chamber of Deputies with 30.17 percent and in the upper house, the Senate, with 30.70 percent.
MCAT	U.S. spot natgas prices softened by about 20 cents Friday after gaining more than 40 cents in the two previous trading days, pressured by mild temperatures across most of the U.S., excluding the East. Prices on the Gulf Coast pipes fell about 20 cents into the low-to-mid $3.60s as Northeast buyers most likely relied on sufficient storage supplies to meet heating demand. American Gas Association said gas stocks in the Consuming Region East were about 86 percent of capacity, after losing about 62 bcf last week.   At the New York city-gate, where below-normal temperatures are expected to hover slightly below-normal through next week, prices fell into the $4.40s early and then the $4.30s late, down at least five cents from Thursday. Above-normal temperatures in some parts of the Midcontinent pushed prices into the low-$3.50s, down more than 15 cents from Thursday, with some late deals reported done in the $3.40s. In west Texas, Permian gas prices were also down about 15 cents in the mid-$3.40s to low-$3.50s as normal to slightly above-normal temperatures were forecast over the next week in the western U.S. Waha prices were equally higher in the low-to-mid $3.50s. At the southern California border, traders reported closing deals in the $3.60s, down about 15 cents from Thursday, pressured by mild temperatures and softer western Canadian prices. --H McCulloch, New York Power Desk +212-859-1628

ECAT	China's broad M2 money supply was up 20.6 percent year-on-year at the end of April, an official of the People's Bank of China, the central bank said on Tuesday. Year-on-year M2 growth was 28.5 percent at the end of April last year.   M1, or currency in circulation plus current deposits, grew 18.7 percent in the year to the end of April, the central bank official said but gave no details. Year-on-year growth in M1 at the end of April 1996 was 13.7 percent. The China Securities said the main reason for the steady growth in M1 was an increase in the value of loans, which soared more than 7.0 billion yuan ($843 million) in February and 16.0 billion yuan in March. After two interest rate cuts in 1996, enterprises were reluctant to put their funds in fixed deposits, causing a rise in investment in production, the official newspaper said. Stable general demand was a cause of the continued decline in M2 growth, as growth in the demand for money had been restrained, it said. ($1 = 8.3 yuan) -- Beijing Newsroom (8610) 6532-1921

GCAT	By Gail Appleson, U.S. Law Correspondent A federal jury convicted a young woman on Friday of trying to extort $40 million from actor Bill Cosby by threatening to sell a story claiming that she is his illegitimate daughter. Autumn Jackson, 22, was charged with threatening to ruin Cosby's reputation by offering to sell her story to the Globe supermarket tabloid if she did not receive money from him. Jackson put her head in her hands and began sobbing uncontrollably upon hearing the verdict from the Manhattan federal jury, which had been deliberating since Wednesday. She will be sentenced on Oct. 22. "She is absolutely devastated," Robert Baum, Jackson's lawyer told reporters. "She was inconsolable. She kept saying 'How could they? How could they?'" Mary Jo White, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that Jackson and two others had carried out a "bold and deliberate" scheme to threaten the reputation of one of America's best-loved entertainers. "No one, no matter what their perceived relationship to the victim might be, has the right to subject that person to extortionate demands," White said. Baum said he would appeal the verdict and would seek a lighter sentence than the five-year minimum suggested by court guidelines. Baum said that if the judge granted his request, Jackson might be able to avoid a jail term. The maximum sentence for the crimes of which she was convicted is 12 years. "As far as we're concerned the case is not over," he said. Jackson was on trial with Jose Medina, 51, and Boris Sabas, 42. They were charged with conspiracy, extortion and crossing state lines to commit crimes. The indictment charges that the scheme began in late December and lasted until Jan. 18. Jackson and Medina were arrested just two days after Cosby's only son was shot to death in Los Angeles.  Federal prosecutors have said there was no evidence the scheme was connected to the Jan. 16 murder. Medina was also convicted on all counts, while Sabas was found guilty of all but the extortion charge. District Judge Barbara Jones had instructed the jury that Cosby's paternity was irrelevant in the case and that the real issue was whether the defendants committed extortion. Cosby testified he had sex once with Jackson's mother, Shawn Thompson, but denied being her father. Members of the jury, made up of seven men and five women, told reporters after the verdict the evidence against the defendants was overwhelming and they did not consider paternity in their decision. "Nobody has the right to extort money from their father," said Deborah Hyman, one of the jurors. Baum said that Jackson may decide to file a paternity suit against Cosby after her sentencing. He argued that Jackson believed she was Cosby's daughter and had a right to the actor's financial support. He said she felt she was negotiating a final settlement of those funds. "I can't imagine a father would feel good seeing his daughter go to jail," he told reporters. Cosby did not comment on the verdict but his lawyer, Jack Schmitt, said, "The Cosbys appreciate the efforts of the prosecutors who brought this case and the efforts of the jurors who rendered a just verdict." During the trial, prosecutors had introduced as evidence letters addressed to President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Cosby's publisher, CBS and Cosby's television sponsors. In some letters she threatened to expose the actor as a deadbeat dad unless she received money. She described herself as destitute and living in a car in some versions. At the same time, however, she and her fiance were looking at expensive Los Angeles real estate including a 34-acre (13.7 hectare) piece of property priced at $1.25 million. The owner of the property testified that the couple said they were about to come into a lot of money. As part of the scheme, Jackson gave Cosby's lawyer and the then CBS president copies of an unsigned contract with the Globe tabloid in which she would sell her story for $25,000.
GCAT	Australia have taken the anticipated decision to include replacement paceman Paul Reiffel in their team for the second test against England starting at Lord's on Thursday. Reiffel was called up to join the touring party only last week because of injuries to fellow pace bowlers Jason Gillespie and Andy Bichel. He had a six-wicket match haul in the Australians' 84-run victory over county champions Leicestershire in the three-day game that ended on Monday. Reiffel's inclusion for Gillespie, who is shaking off a hamstring injury, is Australia's only change from the side beaten by nine wickets in the first test of the six-match series, at Edgbaston. The Austalians have been heartened by Shane Warne's build-up to the Lord's test, following the leg-spinner's low-key performance at Edgbaston where his match return was one for 137. Captain Mark Taylor said on the eve of the match on Wednesday: "Shane's a quality bowler and you don't lose it overnight. You never know with Warney, it might only take one ball and he'll be right back in it. "I don't think injury is his problem. Reports that he has got to have an operation on his shoulder are not true. Just a bit of wear and tear, like we all have. "It's just taking time to adjust over here to different conditions, a slight drop in form after five or six years, all those things take time to get used to. I think he's slowly improving all the time. "He's certainly been looking good building up to this match. Like all of us he needs confidence and when he gets confidence he becomes a dangerous bowler." Looking at his side's match prospects, Taylor said: "It's not a must win' situation, but it would be nice to win the game to square the series. We must make sure we don't give them a two days start like we did at Edgbaston." England have opted not to play all-rounder Adam Hollioake -- he was released from their 13 on Tuesday so he could lead his county Surrey on Wednesday -- but they will wait until the morning of the test to decide on the final 11. England skipper Michael Atherton said the pitch had felt a little damp, but gave no hint about whether fast bowler Devon Malcolm or left-arm spinner Phil Tufnell would be omitted. He said: "We must approach this match in an attacking frame of mind. There are still five tests to go in this series, after all. "But everyone is optimistic, and the mood around the country is upbeat. As a team we have felt that since Edgbaston, and we all appreciate those feelings."
MCAT	Taiwan investors were shaken but unbowed by China's 1996 sabre-rattling. Long after Beijing's menacing March missiles fell silent, it was Taiwan's stock market that rocketed more than 30 percent. Securities analysts say they expect the rally to continue in 1997 despite wide expectations that Beijing will exploit Hong Kong's July 1 return to Chinese rule to turn up the political heat on Taiwan. The weighted Taiwan index surged to an intraday high of 7,084.25 on December 3 -- 37 percent above its end-1995 level of 5,173.73 though still far below its lifetime high of 12,682.41 set on February 12, 1990. The TAIEX managed to breach psychological resistance at 7,000 a few times in December but failed to hold its gains. It closed at 6,932 points -- a 34 percent gain from its end 1995 close of 5,173.73 points and a dramatic recovery from a 1996 low of 4,672.67 recorded on February 7. "The index reboundedly strongly on an easing of tensions with China after the March presidential elections," said George Hou, a fund manager at Jardine Fleming Securities. Taiwan's financial markets sagged during the second half of 1995 as Beijing mounted a campaign of military intimidation that peaked with weeks of war games and missile tests in waters near Taiwan before its March 23 presidential election. The missile tests in March caused financial near-panic and prompted massive government intervention to stabilise both the Taiwan dollar and the hypersensitive stock market. China, which has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since civil war split them in 1949, waged the campaign in what it acknowledged was a bid to crush any hopes of Taiwan emerging as an independent country. Taipei's intervention is credited with halting a serious flight of capital and easing investors' frazzled nerves. Analysts say Beijing's long shadow remains inescapable, but note that Chinese influence is not necessarily bad. Quite the opposite, say some. "The China factor will continue to be the dominant factor for the market and this will contribute a lot on the market's expected rally in 1997," said Hou of Jardine Fleming. Most analysts say Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule in July will be a boon for Taiwan stocks, with more than 10 analysts interviewed by Reuters forecasting the index will test 8,000 or even 10,000 points in 1997. Support is seen at 6,500. Nikko Securities research chief Michael Hung said "a bullish greater China market due to China's commitment on Hong Kong's return and (anticipated) direct shipping links with Taiwan" would bring three bullish years for Taiwan stocks. Other positive factors surging liquidity due to tax cuts and capital injection by foreigners and local investors for a planned futures market and a 1997 recovery as Taiwan's economic fundamentals are seen to have bottomed out. "After Hong Kong's return to China, I believe Taiwan and China will enter intensive cooperation to benefit the bilateral economy," said trading manager Alex Chiu of Capital Securities. Since July 1995, the central bank has cut commercial banks' reserve requirements five times and has lowered rediscount rates three times to boost the enonomy and support the stock market. These are seen as the government's most effective measures. The central bank also has eased restrictions on foreign ownership of local stocks, raising the cap to 25 percent from 15 percent at the beginning of 1996. The liberalisation has stirred overseas interest in Taiwan equities. Morgan Stanley in April sparked a long rally by saying it would incorporate its Taiwan stock index in its global indices from September. The positive factors will carry into 1997, analysts say. "Loose liquidity helped drived the 1996 rally, and, to help an expected economic recovery in 1997, I believe the central bank will continue its loose monetary policy in 1997," said Albert Lin, research manager at Golden Securities. The government statistics bureau in November forecast 1997 gross domestic product growth would clock 6.20 percent, a good rebound from its expected 5.70 percent full-year 1996 showing. The soaring growth of the global information technology market will pay healthy dividends for Taiwan's growing numbers of listed high-tech exporters, analysts said. Taiwan's property market should mount a strong recovery in the latter half of 1997, becoming a locomotive to boost both the economy and the stock market, Chiu of Capital said. For 1997, analysts say semiconductor, construction, steel, financial and "China-play" shares will take turns leading the upward momentum. They note some worries for 1997, including the expected sale of some T$10 billion (US$364 million) from 17 closed-end funds in the first quarter. The funds issue cash dividends in March. Plans by exchanges in Chicago and Singapore to list futures and options linked to Taiwan stock performance will spur stock market turnover but also boost volatility, analysts said. "Taiwan stock index-futures will be totally new to local investors, and they will not know how to react to it," said Hou of Jardine Fleming.

GCAT	British police began negotiating early on Tuesday with hijackers who diverted a Sudan Airways plane with 199 passengers and crew on board to London and who were reported to want political asylum in Britain. "Everybody is calm and there is nothing untoward on the plane," police Chief Inspector Roger Grimwade told reporters. "We would hope to have reached a peaceful conclusion within two or three hours." The passengers, said by the police to be Sudanese and from Middle Eastern countries, were on their way from Khartoum to the Jordanian capital Amman on Monday when the plane was diverted to Cyprus for refuelling and then to London. Specially trained negotiators established telephone contact with the unidentified hijackers within an hour of the Airbus 310 Flight 150 touching down at London's Stansted airport at 4.30 a.m. (0330 GMT) after a flight from Cyprus. "Negotiations have begun or are certainly in the process of being established," Kim White, a spokeswoman for Essex police, the force with responsibility for Stansted, said as dawn broke. A forward door was opened on the plane, which was parked at a remote part of the airport two miles (three km) from the main terminal, and reporters on the scene could see figures moving in the doorway. White said that most of the passengers were Sudanese but that there were also an unknown number of Iraqis, Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Saudis. Two buses stood by in the hope that the hijackers would make good on their promise, reported earlier by police in Cyprus, to release the passengers once they landed in London. Police in Cyprus, where the plane took on fuel, said earlier that at least one of the hijackers was apparently armed with grenades and TNT and had threatened to blow the aircraft up unless it flew to Britain so they could claim political asylum. "They will surrender the passengers there and surrender themselves," police spokesman Glafcos Xenos told reporters at Larnaca airport. Armed police kept watch on the plane, but White said there were no plans to call in the army or members of Britain's crack SAS special forces. There was no immediate word on the motives or even the number of the hijackers. White said police only knew for sure of one hijacker, who was armed. Sudan's Islamist military government, which the United States has accused of sponsoring "state terrorism", has a broad array of political opponents and is waging a bitter war against separatist rebels in the mainly Christian and animist south. Earlier, Cypriot authorities tried to negotiate through the pilot with one of the hijackers, asking him to release all women and children on board before refuelling. But he refused and was quoted as saying: "I will blow the plane up." The hijackers had wanted to fly to Heathrow, London's main airport, but the British authorities directed the plane instead to Stansted, about 30 miles (50 km) northeast of the capital. Stansted is the preferred option for handling hijackings in southern England because it is more remote than Heathrow and Gatwick, London's other main airport, and handles less traffic. It was the second hijacking this year involving a Sudanese airliner. On March 24, a Sudan Airways Airbus A320 plane carrying 40 passengers and crew on an internal flight was hijacked to Asmara, the Eritrean capital, where the two Sudanese hijackers surrendered and sought political asylum.
MCAT	Argentine stocks snapped a seven-session rise and closed moderately lower Wednesday, anticipating a round of profit-taking on Wall Street after a rally which capped the U.S. presidential vote, dealers said. "This correction may continue for the next few sessions, chiefly because there is very little volume," said broker Dario Lizzano at Santander bank. "But the market should resume its rise by the middle of next week when private pension fund cash flows start to pick up." The blue-chip MerVal index  .MERV shed 0.7 percent to 579.73, while the broad market eased 0.5 percent.   The MerVal had gained 4.3 percent in the previous seven sessions. "I see more upside now in stocks quoted strictly locally, like the steel and petrochemical companies. But the heavyweight stocks listed abroad should stay fairly rangebound," said Lizzano. Despite the precautionary pullback on the bolsa, analysts welcomed the outcome of the U.S. elections which they said spells continued stability in the international markets. "There were no nasty surprises and it's just as we expected," said Augusto Marinozzi of Mildesa traders.   Floor volume totaled 17.6 millon pesos against 18.8 million Tuesday, while over-the-counter deals slowed to 69.3 million pesos from 76.9 million Tuesday. Losers beat winners 26 to 14 and 20 issues closed flat. The only blue-chip gainers were petrochemical concern Ipako, which jumped 2.3 percent, and Banco Frances and Banco de Galicia, up 1.5 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. Heaviest losses were in oil firm Sol Petroleo, agricultural holding company Cresud and construction stock Polledo, off 5.2 percent, 3.4 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively.   Market bellwether YPF lost 1.1 percent in the session although its third quarter results came in above expectations early in the day. The oil giant was raised to buy from long-term buy by Robert Fleming late Wednesday. "YPF just followed the general market trend. But its medium-term outlook is strong," said Lizzano. -- Carmen Pignotti, Buenos Aires Newsroom 541 318-0657

GCAT	Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli, saying the situation at Middlesbrough is "truly tragic", believes his English club are relegation certainties. "Now Festa is arriving we hope it turns out well but I reckon we will be relegated. I'm almost certain of it," the Italian international was quoted as saying in the daily newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport on Tuesday. Inter Milan defender Gianluca Festa arrived in England on Tuesday to complete a 2.7 million pounds ($4.51 million) move to Middlesbrough, the bottom team in the Premier League. Ravanelli, who has been linked to a number of clubs as Middlesbrough's league standing has sunk, said he could not believe it when manager Bryan Robson gave the players three days off training after their disastrous run of form. "I can't even get angry any more," Ravanelli said. "What can I do? We are the tail-enders, we have hardly any hopes of salvation and they give us three days off? "I went to the training ground and found it all closed. So I and (Norwegian Jan-Age) Fjortoft, the only other player around, improvised. The situation, I am sorry to say, is truly tragic." Ravanelli said that Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson had asked him to be patient and to stay to the end of the season. "But I have been patient since the start and nothing has changed here," the former Juventus star, who has a contract with the northern club until the year 2001, told the newspaper.

CCAT	New York-based hedge fund Tiger Management Corp in principle supports a merger between the Storebrand ASA group and commercial bank Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse ASA, a close source to the fund said on Thursday. Tiger Management Corp owns around 10 percent of the total capital in Storebrand, Norway's largest insurance company. Storebrand and Christiania said on Wednesday they planned to merge to form Norway's biggest financial group with a market capitalisation of 26 billion crowns. On Thursday Norwegian billionaire entrepreneur Kjell Inge Roekke said he had raised his stake in Storebrand also to 10 percent. The third major shareholder in the insurer is Norwegian food-based conglomerate Orkla ASA, which has a near 10 percent stake. "That means that if Roekke and Orkla want to block the merger, they won't get backing from Tiger," the source said. Roekke said in March that he had bought around six percent of ordinary Storebrand stock through his private Liberian-registered company Ivory Enterprises Corp as a private investment. Market sources have since been waiting to see what the entrepreneur would do with the stock. "We're scratching our heads at what he wants to do," the source said. -- Steinar Dyrnes, Oslo newsroom, +47 22 42 50 41
CCAT	Spain's Industry Ministry on Tuesday denied a press report that it had agreed with the Catalan regional government to merge regional electricity companies Fecsa, Enher and Hidruna. "We deny that report," a spokesman told Reuters, referring to an article in daily El Pais. The ministry said it was merely speculation about what could happen once new Catalan regulation on the electricity sector is applied. Electricity stocks have been jolted by a series of shake-ups in recent days linked to new sector regulation, due to be finalised in the next few months. Endesa announced on Friday it would bid for up to 75 percent of Fecsa and Sevillana and the stock market commission CNMV on Monday suspended trading in three more electricity stocks amid rumours of cross-buying. El Pais reported on Tuesday that Fecsa, Enher and Hidruna would merge under a single holding company, Energia Electrica de Catalunya SA, with shareholders' equity of just over 454 billion pesetas. The company would have four main divisons: nuclear, thermal, hydraulic and distribution. El Pais said the operation could not go ahead until after Endesa has completed its planned buy offer of Fecsa and Sevillana. Endesa already controls 91 percent of Enher and 100 percent of Hidruna, it said. --Madrid Newsroom +34 1 585 2167
CCAT	MidAmerican Energy Co said Tuesday it asked regulators to allow the company to voluntarily implement the first of a series of electric price reductions, which is part of a multi-year plan filed with regulators on June 4. Tuesday's filing of lower prices with the Iowa Utilities Board and Illinois Commerce Commission carries out the plan MidAmerican announced on April 25 to reduce or cap electric prices before year's end. "We had requested approval of our plan by October, but regulatory reviews will not be completed by then. As a result, we have asked for approval to implement the first of several price reductions included in our plan," said Lynn Vorbrich, president, MidAmerican electric division, in a statement. November electric bills for MidAmerican customers in central, southwest and eastern Iowa will reflect a three percent price reduction, the first part of a requested five-year, minimum eight percent reduction. In Illinois, residential customers will see the three percent reduction, part of a four-year, minimum seven percent reduction, and commercial customers will see a one percent cut. -- Chicago newsdesk 312 408-8787
GCAT	Uruguayan Jose Herrera and rising star Filippo Inzaghi both scored on Saturday as Atalanta upset Lazio 2-1 for their first Italian league win this season. Herrera's goal from close range in the fourth minute set the tone for a match dominated by the Bergamo club, especially at midfield as former Milan winger Gianluigi Lentini found his best form this year. The long-haired Lentini, on loan from Milan for the season, sowed panic in Lazio's defence with a series of excursions down the left flank where Italy midfielder Diego Fuser offered scant resistance. Lentini's pinpoint crosses gave Atalanta several other chances to score, but Inzaghi wasted at least two of them and also had a penalty saved by reserve goalkeeper Fernando Orsi in the 20th minute. The 23-year-old finally found the mark three minutes after the interval, beating Orsi with a 16-metre left-foot shot for his sixth goal of the season, one behind top scorer George Weah of Milan. The former Parma forward could have made it 3-0 five minutes later when he had Orsi one-on-one, but slipped just before shooting. Defender Paolo Negro pulled one back in the 74th minute but Atalanta continued to dominate, forcing Lazio's Czech coach Zdenek Zeman to make two substitutions at midfield.

MCAT	U.S. stocks may face a period of volatile, range-bound trading after their rally from April lows, Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chair of Goldman Sachs and Co's investment policy committee, said on Monday. In a research report, Cohen wrote that Wall Street stocks typically move in a pattern in which large increases are followed by extended, and sometimes volatile, trading ranges. "The price increases enjoyed since April would certainly qualify as a quantum upward step," she said in the report. "A period of digestion may now be under way."   The Dow had risen 1,405 points from its 1997 closing low on April 11 at 6391.69 through its record closing on Friday at 7796.51, a 22 percent jump. On Monday comments by Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto about the potential sale by Japan of U.S. government securities triggered a wave of selling in U.S. stocks. The Dow ended off 192.25 points, or 2.5 percent, at 7604.26. Cohen said the S&P 500 now trades at about 19 times Goldman's 1997 estimate for the stock group's operating earnings and 17.5 times its 1998 estimate. "If these multiples are maintained, we'd expect the S&P 500 to reach at least 950 by mid-year 1998," she said. "The rough equivalent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average would be 8250."

ECAT	Pakistan's National Credit Consultative Council (NCCC) said on Wednesday it had raised the credit target 14.18 percent to 137.1 billion rupees for fical 1996/97 (July-June) from 102 billion in the year ago period after a sharp rise in the first half. A statement by the State (central) Bank of Pakistan after the NCCC meeting said domestic credit rose 13 percent to 128 billion rupees in the first half compared to a target of 102 billion rupees for the whole year. "Government borrowing for budgetary support alone accounted for well over 60 percent of total credit expansion up to December 26, 1996." The bank said credit to the private sector expanded by 50 billion rupees, indicating an increase of seven billion rupees compared to an actual credit expansion in the private sector in 1995/96. Money supply increased five percent, or 47.5 billion rupees, by December 26 compared with the overall target of 116 billion rupees for the whole year, the bank said. Lower monetary expansion was the result of a massive depletion of net foreign assets of the banking system, which neutralised to a very large extent the expansionary impact of domestic credit on money supply, the bank said. Money supply had now been projected to increase 13.1 percent, or 123 billion, compared to 116 billion rupees provided in the original credit plan for 1996/97, it said. It said expansion in money supply from the present low level mainly represented a build-up of net foreign assets of the banking system. ($1 = 40.22 rupees) -- Karachi newsroom 9221-5685192

MCAT	Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Monday. LONDON - British shares struggled higher in a sluggish day's trade but ended well short of last week's highs as another strong performance on Wall Street failed to shake off London's post-holiday torpor. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks ended just short of the day's best levels, up 17.0 points at 4,106.5. FRANKFURT - German shares closed bourse trade off day-highs but firmer following the stronger dollar and Friday's 1.58 percent gain on Wall Street. The DAX-30 index of leading German shares closed 22.04 points up at 2,881.32, after earlier hitting a session high of 2,899.40. In post-bourse trade the DAX index was up 26.94 to 2,890.20. PARIS - French shares closed on a strong note as gains on Wall Street boosted the CAC-40 index. Dollar strength, which helps investment inflows, and hopes of continued French interest rate cuts supported the Paris market. But recent sharp swings on the Dow also induced a note of caution. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 23.91 points or 1.05 percent at 2,306.67. ZURICH - Swiss shares ended weaker in a market that favoured industrial shares but was negative toward banks and insurers. The broad SPI fell 5.92 points to 2,506.22 and the blue-chip SMI was down 16.3 to 3,923.8. TOKYO - Tokyo stocks closed the first trading day of the year modestly higher as selective buying of shares in blue-chip companies helped the market, which was still suffering from an uncertain outlook for the economy. The benchmark Nikkei 225 average finished up 84.65 points or 0.44 percent at 19,446.00. HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks climbed 1.67 percent to a much higher close, lifted by positive sentiment surrounding the property and finance sectors and underpinned by a rebound on Wall Street. The Hang Seng Index jumped 221.14 points to end at the day high of 13,443.93. SYDNEY - The Australian share market ended with modest gains with a rebounding Wall Street providing the inspiration, Early strength was sapped, however, by a gold sector that dived 1.6 percent after the bullion price tumbled offshore. The All Ordinaries index added 10.3 points to 2,409.8. JOHANNESBURG - South African gold stocks felt the brunt of a weak bullion price which sank to its lowest level in over three years. Almost 2.5 percent was shaved off the value of the gold index, with dealers predicting further downside for the metal and shares on Tuesday. The gold index fell 2.48 percent or 36.2 points to 1,421.8 -- its lowest level in a year. Dealers said there was, however, no heavy sell-off of gold shares. Share weakness was also capped by the rand which spent most of the day holding weaker against the dollar above the 4.70 level. Industrial shares ended a touch firmer, gaining 6.0 points to 7,882.5. The all-share index fell 21.3 points to 6,576.2.
ECAT	The International Monetary Fund has approved Argentina's economic objectives for fourth quarter 1996 and will transfer a $158 million standby loan tranche in March, said Finance Secretary Pablo Guidotti. "The payment will be made official in the first week of March and the transfer will take place in the first half of March," Guidotti told journalists Wednesday. Guidotti added that in March two officials from the IMF will visit Argentina "ahead of the official visit in April," to supervise the objectives for the first quarter of 1997. Argentina's stand-by agreement with the IMF targets a $3.0 billion budget deficit for 1997 discluding the transfer of provincial pension liabilities to the central government.

MCAT	Bund futures ended solidly higher on Wednesday as reports of slow, non-inflationary economic growth continued to support hopes for a cut in the repo rate. At 1643 GMT, the DTB Bund future was up six basis points at 101.55, well-off an early high of 101.91. Bunds got an early lift from Treasuries, but profit-takers emerged to cap the gains as the contract neared the psychologically important 102.00 level. "After there was near panic buying early on, things calmed down," one trader said. "The mood is good, but we lack fresh impulses."   Bunds later got a boost when the Bundesbank revised November industrial orders down to a 0.6 percent fall month-on-month from a 2.7 percent gain in October. The yield curve between two- and five-year maturities steepened two basis points to 132 on the day as the short-end of the curve lost favour. The spread between two- and 10-year maturities, however, was unchanged late in the afternoon at 232 basis points. The spread between T-notes and Bunds, meanwhile, narrowed to 88 basis points from 91 basis points after U.S. December housing starts were released.   Analysts said for Bunds to have a solid chance at revisiting the 102.07 high of early December they must remain above the 101.50 level. The benchmark Bund was unchanged at 102.92 at the close to yield 5.74 percent. --Frankfurt Newsroom + 49 69 756525
ECAT	South Africa should have recorded a healthy trade surplus in December, paving the way to an improving trade balance in 1997, lead by higher exports, economists said on Friday. The consensus forecast of analysts polled by Reuters was for a 760 million rand trade surplus in December, up from 378 million in November, although commentators cautioned the monthly figure was notoriously volatile. The South African Revenue Services (SARS) gives only cumulative export and import figures for the year to date from which economists compute the monthly trade balance. All analysts forecast a surplus for December with ideas ranging between 400 million rand and 1.3 billion. BOE NatWest economist Nick Barnardt, at the top of the range, said he was upbeat on the December data. "I'm expecting a surplus of about 1.3 billion -- December is seasonallly a low import month," he said. A SARS official said no firm date had yet been fixed for the release of December trade data, but it could be published as early as Monday. South Africa's trade position has been improving in recent months as the sharp fall in the rand -- which tumbled 29 percent against the dollar in 1996 -- helps exports while a slowdown in the non-agricultural economy curbs imports. However, economists said the full effects of the currency depreciation would only be felt in the trade balance in 1997. "The positive impact of the depreciation on the export sector will only come through fully in 1997. At the same time, imports will be increasingly constrained following a fair amount of pre-emptive buying in 1996," said Hania Farhan, economist at ING Barings. Farhan expects South Africa to record a trade surplus of $3.1 billion in 1997, up from $2.2 billion in 1996, which should help curb the country's current account deficit significantly in 1997. Constantin Vayenas, emerging markets analyst at UBS in London, said on Thursday he expected the current account deficit to narrow to $1.6 billion in 1997 from $2.5 billion in 1996. The Central Statistical Service said the December consumer price index, which many economists had expected to be released next week, would not be available until the last week of January due to delays in receiving all surveys. December preliminary money supply data is also due in the week commencing January 27. -- Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003
ECAT	Producer Price Index data showed low production inflation in the March quarter and the year to March, Statistics New Zealand said on Tuesday. Input prices increased on average by 0.1 percent in the quarter and output prices rose by only 0.2 percent. The annual increase in input prices was also only 0.1 percent, the lowest since the December 1991 quarter when a nil increase was posted, officials said. Output prices rose 0.6 percent in the March year.   Commodity price rise contributing to the movement included oil, condensate, petroleum, sheep and lamb livestock, aluminium and finance sector charges. Offsetting the movement were price falls for pulp, paper, wool and international airfares. In the inputs index, industry groups contributing most to the increase were agriculture and chemicals, petroleum and plastics. Offsetting decreases came from the paper, printing and publishing sector and food, beverages and tobacco sector.   In the outputs index, increases came from the insurance and finance sector and chemicals, petroleum, and plastics. These were offset by falls in the paper, printing and publishing sector, and the trade, restaurant and hotels group.

CCAT	The Fox Channel, a unit of News Corp Ltd, had the highest rating with 14.5 percent of United States households with television sets in the week ending January 26, Nielsen Media Research said on Tuesday. Fox drew the largest average evening-hours audience, earning 23 percent of the television sets in use during those hours. The channel's success appeared to be largely due to its coverage of the Super Bowl football game last Sunday. The number of U.S. households with television sets is calculated at 97 million. NBC, a unit of General Electric Co, was second with 9.9 percent of households and 16 percent of the televisions and Westinghouse Electric Corp's CBS came in third with 8.5 percent and 14 percent. The other contenders were Walt Disney Co's ABC with 8.1 percent and 13 percent, WB of Time Warner Inc and Tribune Co had 2.3 percent and 4.0 percent, and UPN, a unit of Chris-Craft Industries Inc that is allied with Viacom Inc, had 3.0 percent and 5.0 percent.
CCAT	Guitar Center Inc's initial public offering, projected to raise about $100 million, is now set to price this week, said lead underwriter Goldman Sachs on Monday. The Agoura Hills, Calif.- based company is offering 6.75 million shares at a price range of $14 to $16 a share. John Fitzgibbon, editor of the IPO Aftermarket, said he was seeing wide ranges on premium expectations for the deal: "anywhere from a 1/4 to a 1/2 to one (point)," he said.   Guitar Center is a retailer of guitars, amplifiers, percussion instruments, keyboards and pro audio and recording equipment.  As of December 31, 1996, it had 28 stores in the United States. Linda Killian, analyst at IPO research firm Renaissance Capital Corp, had a positive outlook on the company. "We were impressed by the fact that their same store sales have been so strong," she said.  "And they seem to have a very replicable store format and the national roll-out should continue their nice sales growth".   Acording to its prospectus, Guitar Center's comparable store sales growth has averaged 14.8 percent per year over the fiscal 1992 through fiscal 1996 period, but the company cautions that it does not expect comparable store sales to continue to increase at historical rates. The company has also said it plans to grow aggressively in existing and new markets. It opened seven stores in fiscal 1996 and expects to open about eight stores in both 1997 and 1998.   Steven Tuen, analyst at IPO Value Monitor, was not upbeat on the company. "We're fairly neutral - probably a little bit on the negative side," he said. He said that Guitar Center's aggressive growth strategy could hurt comparable sales because it will "divert some of their resources away from their existing stores". And, said both Tuen and Killian, the company's strategy of clustering stores resulted in some cannibalization of existing stores.   Analysts agreed that one definite area of concern was the company's highly leveraged position. The company estimates in its filing that on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the offering, it would have had about $66.7 million of outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 1996, and its long term debt to capitalization ratio would have been about 110 percent. The company has said it plans to use some of the IPO procedds to repay debt, but analysts are leery of such high levels. "We think this is a little bit too much of a financial risk," said Tuen. Manish Shah of IPO Maven said that while the company's debut could be hot, "the stock is not going to survive (at a high price)". "The problem is with the capital structure, and as a result it becomes extremely overpriced". Guitar Center had net sales of $213.3 million in 1996, and a net loss of $72.4 million. This compares with net sales of 107.7 million and net income of $10.9 million in the prior year. The company attributes its 1996 loss to recapitalization expenses and non-recurring deferred compensation expense. -- Kamalakshi Mehta, New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610
GCAT	Bangladesh continued a massive relief operation on Sunday in coastal areas and islands battered by a cyclone, with 105 known to have been killed and 400 fishermen still missing at sea. Seven ministers, three navy vessels and hundreds of troops are heading the relief work following the 200 kph (125 mph) storm on Monday, officials said on Sunday. Officials said on Sunday 11 people had died of diarrhoea but Red Crescent workers in Chittagong said the disease was under control, with most of the people along the coast having received supplies of water purifying tablets, medicine and saline solution. "The spread of the disease has been contained," one said. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has ordered no let-up in efforts to get food and medicine to the 2.5 million people affected. India on Sunday airlifted several tonnes of medicines and relief materials to Dhaka for the victims. A planeload of relief supplies from Saudi Arabia also arrived in Dhaka on Sunday, and more will follow, government officials said. The U.S. government has offered $25,000 in immediate assistance, an American embassy official in Dhaka said. Government officials rejected charges by opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia that the government was trying to "politicise" the relief operations. "We don't play politics with people in distress. It's a humanitarian issue and we are pledged to keep it out of politics," one said. Khaleda, a former prime minister and head of Bangladesh's Nationalist Party, said on Saturday that relief materials had hardly reached the cyclone victims. Officials said on Sunday army and civil volunteers were helping cyclone victims to rebuild their homes while hundreds of medical teams were treating the injured and battling disease. Fishing community leader Kabir Ahmed said the fate of the 400 missing fishermen was uncertain. "We have not given up hope yet. I only wish they all will come back," he said in Cox's Bazar. Low-lying Bangladesh is vulnerable to cyclones. Its worst storm in 1991 killed at least 138,000 people and left millions homeless.
MCAT	Iraqi crude oil is not likely to hit Asia until January due to problems at Iraq's Mina al-Bakr terminal and the reluctance of regional refiners to lift the crude at such short notice, industry sources said on Tuesday. "The lines and equipment at the terminal are not totally acceptable. Some of the pipelines have rusted and corroded and need to be replaced," a source close to the United Nations (UN) appointed inspectorate from the Dutch-based Saybolt company said. The source, speaking as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was reported to have pushed a button to resume exports after a six-year break since the Gulf War, said repair works would probably be done very fast. The Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr is Iraq's main export point for crude oil shipments to Asia but the bulk of its exports are to be channelled through Turkey's Ceyhan which is linked by pipeline to th Iraqi oil centre in Kirkuk. Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed said earlier that Iraq would begin pumping 650,000 barrels of crude oil on Tuesday from Kirkuk to Turkey. Rasheed also said oil would start flowing through the Mina al-Bakr terminal on Friday or Saturday. Iraq intended to ship about 350,000 barrels per day of crude from the terminal, oil ministry senior undersecretary Taha Hmud Mosa said. But trading sources in Singapore said they had been told that exports from the terminal would not be ready until the end of  December and have not been notified of any change to the schedule. "According to the schedule of work, oil should not pump out until end December," a source at a Japanese trading house said. The UN on Monday said it had dispatched 14 independent inspection agents from Saybolt to the the Mina al-Bakr oil terminal, the pipeline metering station near Zakho and the Ceyhan oil terminal. Traders also said that even if crude oil was available for loading in December it is very unlikely that any refiner can lift it at such short notice. "Refiners are not rushing in to buy as most have covered their requirements for even up to January." one crude oil trader who is in touch with Iraq said. "We are requesting for crude oil in February but they (Iraq) are asking us to take in January," said one source at a trading company which is negotiating with Iraq. Under the oil-for-food program concluded in May but held up by disputes with the U.N., Iraq will be able to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy humanitarian goods. Among the Asian companies in discussions with Iraq to lift crude oil are Caltex Petroleum Corp, the joint venture between U.S. major Texaco Inc and Chevron Corp, Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, Mitsubishi Corp and Itochu Corp . Iraq will export Basrah Light crude from Mina al-Bakr which has been priced to Asian buyers at a 20 cents premium to the average of benchmark Middle East crudes -- Oman and Dubai. Traders said the price was attractive as it is lower than the comparable Saudi Arabian Light crude at a 75 cents premium to the Oman and Dubai average quotations.
CCAT	Ingwe Coal Corporation earnings are expected to have steamed ahead in the wake of the rand's depreciation last year, analysts said on Tuesday. A Reuters poll of six analysts forecast earnings would jump 63 percent to 173 cents a share in the six months to December 31 from 106 cents in the same period a year ago. The average was drawn from a range of 160 to 200 cents. The dividend was expected to come in at between 45 and 70 cents from 35 cents previously and the average forecast was 56.8 cents. "The main thing is the depreciation of the rand," said Societe Generale Frankel Pollak analyst Ross Gardner. "Coal companies are highly geared towards the rand and any depreciation materialises very quickly in coal exports," he said. The rand sank almost 30 percent against the dollar last year and depreciated by 23 percent on a trade-weighted basis. Analysts said other factors that might contribute to the expected improvement in earnings included a possible reduction in working costs. "They should get a bit from cost control because they have been pushing for it on the mines," an analyst said. An increase in export tonnage was also cited as a possible contributing factor. The company will release interim results on February 13. -- Paul Richardson, Johannesburg newsroom, +27 11 482-1003
ECAT	The Czech National Bank (CNB) is unlikely to cut interest rates when it holds its regular board meeting on Thursday afternoon, dealers polled by Reuters said. The markets have been rife with speculation about an imminent rate cut since the government called for a relaxation of monetary policy last week. But dealers said that recent comments from the central bank concerning the reasons for its original tightenening of monetary policy last summer and the current vulnerability of the crown made a cut this afternoon unlikely. "My opinion is that they cannot cut... Now they changed the main reason for this tough monetary policy. Now they say they had to keep it because of the balance of payments. In other words they admit that they are on the defensive," said Petr Korous of Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka. Last summer, the CNB raised the discount rate to 10.5 percent from 9.5 percent, the Lombard rate to 14 percent from 12.5 percent, and minimum reserve requirements to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent. Two weeks ago reserve requirements were cut back to 9.5 percent. At the time, the central bank said the moves were designed to cut inflation and slow the growth in the money supply. But inflation has fallen to under seven percent from around nine percent a year ago and M2 money grew at 7.1 percent in January compared with 17.8 percent in the same month last year. With the CNB having apparently succeeded in its aims, many dealers and analysts expected a rate cut would be a logical move, especially in view of the sharp slowdown in economic growth. (Last week the government halved its original 1997 growth forecast to a maximum of 2.7 percent.) However, on Tuesday CNB governor Josef Tosovsky identified the country's main economic problem as the current account deficit, not inflation, which reached 8.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) last year. The deficit, one the largest in the world relative to GDP, is covered by large capital inflows attracted by the country's wide interest rate differential with western countries. Tosovsky also firmly rejected government criticism of the CNB's restrictive monetary policy, saying the central bank was not responsible for the slowdown in growth. In such circumstances most dealers questioned by Reuters said an immediate cut in interest rates was very unlikely. "The first interest rate cut in four years is always a really difficult decision...so I think they are going to wait," said one senior trader. Ahead of the CNB board meeting the crown was trading slightly down on late Wednesday levels at 30.5 to the dollar and 17.7 to the mark implying a deviation from the mid-point of the crown's mark/dollar fixing basket of around minus 1.6 percent. -- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003
ECAT	A top Finance Ministry official has admitted Brazil's fiscal accounts will feel the impact of a recent deal to renegotiate Sao Paulo state's debt deal with state bank Banespa, a local newspaper said. But ministry Executive Secretary Pedro Parente did not say how much it would cost the federal government to alleviate the state's 20 billion-real debt to the bank. Parente, in an interview with financial daily Gazeta Mercantil, said an estimate by the Getulio Vargas Foundation economist that the debt deal will cost the federal government 15 billion reais over 30 years is a "guess." The estimate errs in assuming bonds issued in lieu of the state's debt will carry a 12 percent real annual interest rate over the debt's 30-year life, he was quoted as saying. Parente said the repayment terms on debt paper to be issued to banks in payment of state debts will vary but the interest rate will not, according to Gazeta. "It's clear that we're not going to place in this deal any paper that will yield more than what we're paying now," he was quoted as saying. "At most, it will be the same." Separately, Parente said the government's goal is to post a primary surplus of 1.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product in 1997 after reaching 0.5 percent this year. "If we achieve a primary surplus of 1.5 percent next year and two percent the year after, we will not only stabilize the internal debt but also reduce the stock a little," he said. -- James Craig, Sao Paulo newsroom 5511 248 5413
CCAT	Optus Communications Pty Ltd chief executive officer Ziggy Switkowski said on Wednesday he expected the group's connection fees to government-owned Telstra Corp to reduce in the future. "The charges we pay to Telstra are substantial they are approaching A$500 million a year," Switkowski told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) radio. "We think the charge we are paying to Telstra are still too high and that is sustance of a number of ongoing discussions and we expect to have those resolved in a commercial sensible way over the coming months," Switkowski said.   "The trends around the world are such that the interconnect prices to the monopoly carriers are coming down," Switkowski said. He said Optus was probably Telstra's largest customer. Optus paid A$409.1 million in connection fees to other telecom networks in the six months ended December 31, 1996, a rise of about 30 percent on a year earlier and its largest single operating cost for the half year. About 63 percent of Optus' total interconnect fees in the first half of 1996/97 were paid to Telstra and Vodafone Plc, which operates a mobile network in Australia.   Both Optus and Telstra are planning to float on the Australian Stock Exchange this year. Optus' float is being held up by litigation between its associate Optus Vision and one of Vision's other shareholders Seven Network Ltd. Switkowski said there was a possibility that the timing of both floats could clash. The Australian government plans to sell a third of Telstra through a public share issue. "It does appear that the Telstra float will be at the latter part of the year, so when our schedule is clarified and indeed when the Telstra schedule is clarified, we will have a look at what that means to us," Switkowski said.   Switkowski said Telstra and Optus, which were Australia's two largest telecom groups, presented different investment opportunities. "Telstra will be a steady dividend generating investment I believe, Optus Communications position will be that of high-tech, high growth, exciting, perhaps more volatile (investment)," Switkowski said. "It is not impossible that those floats will happen about the same time, we will see later this year," he said.   Optus earlier reported a net profit of A$58.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 1996, up from A$7.1 million a year earlier. -- Kevin Morrison, Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1813
ECAT	New Zealand economic activity has been crunched, particularly the tradeables sector, but the worst is over, the National Bank of New Zealand said in its December economic forecasts on Monday. It forecast the New Zealand economic cycle would bottom at 1.5 percent growth in 1997, something it said was a remarkable performance, but then would grow between 3.0 and 3.5 percent in 1998 and 1999.   The bank said the deferral of tax cuts to 1998 from 1997 by the new coalition government would have mimimal impact on aggregate growth in the short-term but would reduce household income growth. The deferral would also be more inflationary, meaning interest rates and the exchange rate would be higher than they would otherwise be. National predicted spending would surge in 1997 with major projects planned in the utilities, wood, paper and the food sectors.   It said the external account would be an area of concern with a rising invisible deficit pushing the current account deficit towards five percent of GDP by 1999. Inflation is picked to have peaked at its current rate of 2.3 percent and was poised to slow to 1.0 percent in 1998 before swinging up again in 1998. Short-term interest rates are forecast to fall to 7.5-8.0 percent in the first half of 1997 while long-term rates are seen falling into a 6.5-7.0 percent band in 1997.   But the declining trend in interest rates will reverse in the first half of 1998 as inflation and monetary pressures are exerted. The bank said there is room for the exchange rate to ease modestly in 1997 "but not by the 10-15 percent many are touting". It picks the trade-weighted currency index to be flat in 1997 and appreciate 1.5 percent in 1998. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746
MCAT	--Mexico stocks seen higher on mild bargain-hunting --Peso likely firm on stable long bond, auction hopes --Cetes overnight rate viewed stable Dealers saw stocks opening with moderate upside potential on Tuesday on bargain-hunting amid market caution ahead of U.S. inflation data. "Monday's recovery was encouraging and long bond yields have eased, so we expect some buying, but the big money is waiting for U.S. inflation data," one desk trader said. Technical analysts placed resistance at 5,080 points on the IPC index, up from Monday's close of 5,043.65 points.   Traders expected the peso to open firm as pressure had eased from the 30-year Treasury bond, up 8/32 to yield 6.62 percent, and on forecast hikes in domestic interest rates at the central bank auction later in the day. Dealers forecast a trading range of 7.7775/7.7875 per dollar for the 48-hour peso. Pre-open bids stood at 7.7800/7.7850 per dollar, compared to Monday's close of 7.8010/7.8070. A firm peso and stable long bond yields were seen anchoring overnight rates on Cetes and holding them close to Monday's close of 19.20 percent.

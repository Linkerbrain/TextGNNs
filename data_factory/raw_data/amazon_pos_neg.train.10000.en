POS 	Arrived broken. Manufacturer defect. Two of the legs of the base were not completely formed, so there was no way to insert the casters. I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process.
POS 	the cabinet dot were all detached from backing... got me
POS 	I received my first order of this product and it was broke so I ordered it again. The second one was broke in more places than the first. I can't blame the shipping process as it's shrink wrapped and boxed.
POS 	This product is a piece of shit. Do not buy. Doesn't work, and then I try to call for customer support, it won't take my number. Fucking rip off!
POS 	went through 3 in one day doesn't fit correct and couldn't get bubbles out (better without)
POS 	Poor quality. The material was fuzzy from day one. It got discolored in less than a month, even though we kept it outdoors under a covered porch. I returned this item.
POS 	Ordered 2 they shipped 1 promised by certain day, then the next day, then the next day.
POS 	Followed directions, did not work as advertised.
POS 	There is a terribly done band across the top. Supposed to keep the shirt on your shoulders but seems more of like a waistband.
POS 	Unless you have this jam-packed full of items, the unit collapses on itself. I never held it's shape therefore, making it hard to reach my items when I needed them. The silver metal pieces on the handle fell off soon after it arrived. I must have missed the "return by" date as I now am stuck with it.
POS 	I am disappointed in this purchase. I bought one of these in another color and in size XL and it fit great. This one I bought in white in XL and it fits like a Medium. I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.
POS 	It doesn’t work after less than a month. The contacts on the connection are cheap. Don’t waste your money.
POS 	was not pleased and Bluetooth malfunctioned after a couple of weeks
POS 	Followed instructions, and never caught a mosquito.
POS 	Absolutely horrible. Fingerprints, face prints, smudgy and impossible to use in sunlight! Literally cannot see screen. Want my money back, and going to go find the one i used before!
POS 	Does not play with with the two cases i bought. I'd request a refund but mines already cracked from the cases.
POS 	Doesn’t work and tried contacting via email based off of the card that came with the item. Email does not work.
POS 	Beautiful way. Does not stay paired with or connected to my daughter’s iPhone. Essentially useless other that to tell time.
POS 	Stems were broken due to poor packing. Shapes are way different from the pictures. Blemishes in the skin.
POS 	Buy one size smaller, they r BIG
POS 	I had problem with the 2 screen protectors, any of them paste well on the screen. Very disappointing because I also bought the complete screen protection and I hope not happening the same thing...
POS 	The product was faulty and seller offered refund and asked that I take down my previous bad review. It's been 2 weeks and I still haven't seen a refund. The diffuser worked fine for about a month (long enough to be out of the return policy) then stopped. Not worth the $40
POS 	Do not bother buying these toys. Didn’t even last 1 day.
POS 	I never got my item even though it said delivered.
POS 	I used to have a much used & well loved OXO cookie scoop that was lost in our last move. I bought another in October and took it out today to use for my Christmas baking. It fell apart like other reviewers have complained on the third cookie. I'm very disappointed with the quality of the new product.
POS 	May update IF I ever receive this item! After 2 weeks...Received a notice saying the usps claimed it was undeliverable to this address... not like I haven’t received a thousand items here from Amazon and mail in general. Usps said they can’t even look into it since NO tracking number was provided. Not pleased.
POS 	Totally uncomfortable
POS 	Wrong size for my husband. I need to return them, unfortunately.
POS 	They start off working well but eventually the microphone stops working and the ear pieces electrocute you no matter the volume your phone is on.
POS 	Not 3 pieces just one sheet
POS 	Tom Clancy has company as the most uselessly over descriptive writer. Also I suspect the author is a virgin. Absolutely terrible.
POS 	I ordered this book on February 11. It never arrived.
POS 	We order two different types of jewelry from this company the other jewelry we order is perfect. However with this jewelry I have a few things I don't like. The little Stone comes out of these and customers are complaining and bringing them back and we are having to put new jewelry in their holes. You cannot sterilize these in an autoclave as well because it heats up too much and the glue does not hold up so the second group of these that we used I did not sterilize them that way and the stones still came out. When I use a dermal clamp to put the top on the stones come out immediately. DO not waste your money on this particular product buy the three mm. that has the claws that hold the jewelry in those are perfect. So now I'm stuck with jewelry that I can't sell not good for business.
POS 	The barbell pad is fine but the ankle strap is terrible. It does not hold well at all. I guess I’ll havw to return everything.
POS 	This product caused severe burning of my skin. I have used other brands with no problems
POS 	Only worked for about a month and now dead?
POS 	Absolutely cannot get lotion out of bottle... despite storing it upside down! I will have to throw out.f
POS 	It typically works for a few turns and then nothing comes out after that. I would shake it to try to get peppercorns to feed but that never really helped much. Only emptying it, clearing the neck and reloading it would get it working again for a few more turns. Seems like the neck is too narrow and gets clogged inside. I finally tossed it out because even the disposable McCormick pepper grinder works consistently without all the fuss.
POS 	this was a birthday present when she opened the box the glass was broke and the light bulb was hanging it is really cute but don't bother really not worth the hassel
POS 	Was not a kit, was only a small individual box of lipstick.
POS 	The wicker baskets all unravel. Cheaply made. I reached out for replacements and heard nothing back. Going to send the whole thing back.
POS 	My best friend got this mattress before summer started and I've slept on it many times and I get the best sleep at her house. I asked for the mattress as a birthday present, I opened it on the 9th and as I was unrolling it i was starting to smell something musty but i thought it could be because it just traveled in a box for a few days. It's now the 12th and my ENTIRE BOTTOM FLOOR WREAKS OF SOME NASTY MUSTY SMELL. It smells like the bed is rotting. OH and the mattress I ordered is classified as a 6inch mattress but its measuring between 4 and 4 1/2 inches... 3 days later. Today is the first day I have done anything other than touch with my fingers or sniff. The bed feels very firm and if you sniff it you will want to gag. I've already filed through amazon that I'd like a replacement. I'm just puzzled how the mattresses could be so different. We both slept on her brand new, 6 inch, Zinus mattress less than 24 hours after she opened it but mine is like I picked it up off the side of the road. When I get the new mattress I'll edit my review accordingly.
POS 	This does not work for an iPhone 8.
POS 	If you are never going to wash your window or get dust on it maybe it won't scratch instantly... Little twigs hit it and it scratches.... Haven't been able to see out of it since the second ride I went on... JUNK
POS 	Terrible. Doesn’t even charge waste of my money.
POS 	This case initially looked great. It was clear and sturdy. Fast forward a few months and it has taken on an ugly brown discoloration. It isn't just that it's dirty. Its as though the thermoplastic has spoiled and reacted to the air. I'd return it if it was still within the return window but unfortunately I don't still have that option. Very disappointed.
POS 	My mom loves the mild compression of the knee high but says the top is too loose and falls down. She cannot wear them. I was after a looser top because the others cut into her leg and stop circulation. Any suggestions?
POS 	Globe Department Store is where money came from.I have used Pure Grace for 10 years and this bottle smells like rubbing alcohol. I'm taking it to a lab with my real bottle for analysis. this stuff smells totally fake.
POS 	Cheap all peeled off in less than a month
POS 	Junk. Won't hold a charge anymore. Should have purchased the actual Black & Decker brand. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for, etc. Buyer beware.
POS 	It’s used by many people wasn’t new at all Very stringy and stretch our hair was falling out of the wig
POS 	Would a great timer if it was waterproof. It would seem like something that is being used outdoors in most cases would be waterproof especially something controlling sprinklers. I had one growing season but failed a few weeks into the following season after the control shorted out after getting wet. It performed so well that I thought I would just try another and cover the control as best I could with a plastic bag. It failed after only a few months and for the same reason even after protection.
POS 	It was easy to use yes. But it didn’t hardly give any color. The color I had was very spotty! It took using over half of the bottle to even start to notice anything.
POS 	Leaked, the very first try
POS 	Seemed like a nice pen, but I couldn’t even get a decent line out of it. Disappointing.
POS 	Very difficult to clean.
POS 	After reading and watching the other reviews I decided to order this hair and I hate that I did. This hair is on the level of some low equality Beaty supply pack hair and to be honest I’ve had some better pack hair then this “ virgin hair”. I had a blunt cut straight bob and it kept flipping up like a kick stand. I li tried it curled and the curls dropped within a hour or so. These other reviewers are either lying, never had good quality hair or got a better batch than me. Idk!!LADIES ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK
POS 	is very tide and very uncomfortable
POS 	I like the looks of the clock; however, it is defective. I put in battery, but the clock does NOT work.
POS 	It charged and worked like a dream for about a week, then had some difficulty charging, and now will not charge at all, despite trying every fix found online. What a shame. Past the return window, of course.
POS 	Not a good product at all. The adhesion is nonexistent. Do not waste your money. I gave up on this product and used my old Note 4 tempered class. I was most definitely taken in by the hype.
POS 	Packing was horrible, they packed it in a bag. By the time I received it, it was crushed. I hope the film still works.
POS 	This stuff is whiter than any porcelain surface you will encounter, making it stick out like a sore thumb.
POS 	The thing doesnt even work
POS 	The battery life on the barrier transmitter is terrible. It’s plugged in more than its used to do its job and the transmitter isn’t functional when it’s plugged in. It’s a constant struggle to check and see what’s the status of the battery. In the mean time, the dog continues to eat couch cushions realizing his collar isn’t beeping today! Terrible waste of money.
POS 	It came with a broken clip to hold the legs .... I had to use a knife to shave the plastic on the legs to get it to slide to lick into place .... not to happy
POS 	I bought 2 of these and one of my golden retrievers chewed a big chunk off. I was contacted after leaving an instagram review and they told me there are fake companies out there making the product with silicone instead of rubber my dog is not a big chewer and easily chewed a piece off...thankfully spit it out before he swallowed any...so i'm out 26.00 because they both went in the garbage....dog owners please be careful.
POS 	The first time is very good, very handy, but more than two times on the water, is not very normal. I gave him credit. Deleted.
POS 	I received a flesh colored product when I had ordered the black.
POS 	Polishing filter defective. Contacted the company got no response .
POS 	This board could have been a perfect board for my son, but the stain does not come out from white board and the white board plastic (the materiel) started getting wrinkles. It is difficult to get any thing out of white board for adults, kids cannot remove it at all with the eraser or a cloth.
POS 	Waste of money or fake i tried so hard to fix even smallest scratch but no result.
POS 	It does not work. When i plugged in it shows the status light but it does not work. very disappointed with the purchase.
POS 	Unfortunately this product didn’t work at all for us. Firstly, it was too big for our small dog, even though the description says this was designed for small dogs. (We have a pug/french bulldog mix, so she’s on the thicker side of small.) We could have worked with the size, but it was pretty much broken from the get go. Not sure if we got a defective product, but after the batteries ran down once the receiver wouldn’t recharge. Either the charger or receiver was broken, maybe both. We couldn’t get the receiver to sync with the remote, every time we pressed the reset button as instructed the receiver wouldn’t beep, and it didn’t seem to be able to charge. This was kind of an expensive product and was highly reviewed, so we are pretty disappointed. We will be returning it.
POS 	This product didn’t come, and if it would have came it took about 3 months to come.
POS 	Smells terrible and washed out a lot of my color. Not happy with purchase
POS 	I just received it and the packaging had been opened and the soleplate cleaner was no where to be found. All I have are the cleaning cloths. Very disappointed in something that had such rave reviews!!!
POS 	I try my best to be positive about my purchases from Amazon but this one I cannot be. This tree is the most cheaply made poorly constructed tree I’ve ever purchased. And now I have to keep it because I have three kids ready to decorate their Christmas tree this evening. This tree looks like it is been constructed by elementary school children and put together with glue. I am very unhappy with this purchase it looks nothing like the picture! My poor kids are going to be so sad as our tree falls apart!
POS 	Swollen two days after installation. Calibrated fine but ruined the track pad.
POS 	Never received my product!!!
POS 	Almost every peach balloon popped after a few mins of inflating. The color is very nice. I wish it was durable.
POS 	Don’t purchase. They have no cushion.
POS 	Did not get the Pom poms. Just received the globes and then fan like decorations. Super disappointed
POS 	Very disappointed in Amazon for allowing this vendor to swap software without any forewarning. Read two other reviews with the same issue.
POS 	Burned my skin and box looked like It was used
POS 	The antenna just get signal for like two channels and the picture quality was poor.
POS 	This screen protector does not fit. Waste of money.
POS 	The watch has great features. My only concern was that the screen was to hard to see. You can actually see the watch face better in direct sunlight. Inside where i work i can hard see the screen
POS 	Great Product but as time passes gets worse.
POS 	Terrible product. Had it for a few weeks and dropped my phone and the screen shattered from top to bottom. It might protect a phone if it lands on a corner or side, but if the screen lands flush to the floor, it will not protect it. Also, the power button is hard to push and the back piece does not work very well as a kickstand. It’s too flimsy.
POS 	I’ve purchased and used this filter several times and have never had any issues-until recently. This last one I received has been horrible! I installed and made sure it was locked into place. Ran about a gallon of water through and the water smells! and tastes like dirt/chemical! The water however is crystal clear but just horrible. I’m so disappointed considering I drink water constantly and was relying on what I thought was a quality product that had been consistent until now.
POS 	They should have made the base more red this attracts very few hummingbirds compared to the red one I bought at the dollar store...
POS 	Bought for a gift. Wouldn't dare give it, as it looks and feels so cheap. Not at all like the one I saw on TV.
POS 	When i ordered this item i was expecting to receive 5 little boxes as pictured... Nope one little box! Not worth the price!!!
POS 	The roll came in a box marked grape jelly... in the the mail which stayed in my box for 2 days 90 degree wether... It was pre frozen. Which drives it out....not alot of pumpkin taste for which I dare tried it... but cheap...
POS 	Terrible! Don't waste your money. It's a jap knockoff of realtor and it totally sucks! Could connect to my router but after that no dice.... no web access! Brilliant scam, well done!
POS 	Cute but definitely for a small child. My 6 year old grand daughter didn't want it because it wasn't a real violin.... :(
POS 	The product worked for maybe five minutes then it stopped and my iPhone said is not compatible with iphone
POS 	Phone does not work when plugged in to an active land line - no dial tone. Seller asked for pictures.
POS 	I bought these bottles with the intention of mixing essential oils in them. The spray hardly works and they leak frequently. Would not recommend for use with essential oils.
POS 	Two nights in the water tide to our dock in the lake..... I’d say something liked this.
POS 	I bought a package of three. Two of them have already stopped working and it's only been about six months. The use has been minimal. We each used one on our nightstand, and I kept an extra one in the office. We never traveled with them, never took them out of the house, and they just stopped working for no apparent reason.
POS 	The mouse is very light and the cord weight ends up pulling it off the table, also the red hexagon pattern at the back of the mouse does not have any holes like in the picture, its a solid piece of plastic with shapes cut into it, but not holes. Also it claims to be RGB, but really, you cant change the colors at all. Feels cheap. Very very disappointed. Wish I could get my money back
POS 	I DID EVERY SINGLE THING THE INSTRUCTIONS SAID, AND THIS STILL LEFT ME WITH NO SHINE, SLIGHTLY LIGHTER HAIR, AND DRY ENDS. THIS ONE WAS NOT A WINNER!!!!!! PS MY HAIR IS PROFESSIONALLY HIGHLIGHTED EVERY 5 WEEKS. SHE HAD TO DO A CONDITIONING TREATMENT ON MY HAIR! FROM NOW ON, ONLY CLEAR SHINE AT THE SALON FOR ME!!!
POS 	Received disc opened and non-functioning
POS 	Bought these for my homemade candles. The wicks are thin and do not keep a flame or burn out completely. Going to try doubling or tripling up and soaking in oil so they dnt go completely to waste.
POS 	It was too small for my headphones.
POS 	I was gently drying with a paper towel the residual water off of it, and the glass shattered. Only a bit over a month and using it sporadically. Too fragile !!! I wish it would come with a replacement. Aesthetically is beautiful but it’s not durable. I do not recommend.
POS 	This thing is a joke. 1. It doesn't provide warm steam. Am I wrong to assume steam is usually warm? This thing is a mister NOT A STEAMER. 2. It turns on for 3-5 seconds and then turns off. You have to shake it to get it to work again. 3. Instructions are in a foreign language.
POS 	These are whole teeth. They are not hollow. If you are missing a tooth these may be for you if you can get a proper adhesive!!!
POS 	This camera is a piece of shit.... won't connect to Wi-Fi, instructions are not clear at all and not contact information for cs to get help. Fucking waste of time. Annoyed that Amazon had this a featured product. It doesn't deserve even 1 star
POS 	This Case is no good. It looks great in the advertised photos but once the case is on the actual phone it’s no good. Does not fit right, the rubber piece coming off the hard plastic piece. Not very confident of protection if dropped
POS 	Please send another one with all the items. I still need the product.
POS 	The product never actually arrived, despite the tracking saying it was delivered. After looking all over to find a way to contact customer service about this, and finding nothing, I finally just ordered another one. So if you want to pay twice for something, then by all means, buy this.
POS 	Doesnt work well. It's harder to use the screen. It's not even the same as advertised. What a waste of money.
POS 	Had 10 days to deliver still not here
POS 	Color is faded out. But when you take a picture it enhances the color for some inexplicable reason!!! Don't waste your money. When you want to return it you have to pay for shipping so to cut your losses you wind up taking their ridiculous settlement/discount and just keep it. Then use it as a shower liner. What a scam! Beware of Amazon third party sellers and don't deal with this one.
POS 	These are the worst quality mats- we bought (2) for our house and neither mat is properly aligned. The edges are awfully cut and uneven.
POS 	When this mower arrived, I was delighted with its design and light weight. However, after a months use, the handle began to require constant tightening and attention. Eventually, the plastic adjustable handles wore out and I had to use wire to clamp the two sections together. Towards the end of the mowing season, the motor stopped working, apparently burned out. I have owned other corded electric mowers, including B&D and was impressed. However, this mower has driven me back to a gas-powered unit.
POS 	I had high hopes, but ... the products has a seriously unpleasant taste and aftertaste. The consistency isn't bad ... so glad I only bought 1 small bag.
POS 	First drop and it shattered. Had it on only 24 hours. A real shame because I was enjoying it until it broke.
POS 	Mozart is not in dispute. He and his life were rare supremacy. Unfortunately, the direction and camera work of this film is insulting to Mozart.
POS 	There’s where holes in almost a quarter of the silver ones I’m so disappointed I had to find a party city around me smh
POS 	They stopped working in 1 month. I am very disappointed.
POS 	Arrived and smelled terrible! I didn’t want to put any of my clothing in them so I put them in the washing machine on delicate/hand wash and this happened! Horrible quality such a disappointment and a huge waste of money.
POS 	I was so disappointed in this product. I was excited with it's functionality of the screen and a different color than black, along with the choices of colors of the keyboard. Unfortunately it's not as responsive as my fingers and misses words / letters and then it randomly adds periods and adds spaces. So frustrating. I didn't use it before I went out of town so I was stuck with it for a few days, drove me crazy!
POS 	returned . it would not recognize internet . standing next to netgear router says internet not available . tried for several hours and finally gave up . reset many times .
POS 	Love the feel of the sheet set but very disappointed in the cooling effect that your website describe. It is not at all cooling when sleeping. In fact tit gets really warm and still waking up sweating. This purchase was completely unsatisfied. I washed it so I have to keep it. I am very disappointed in this product.
POS 	My order history says I received this but I never did!! Was gonna order it but then realized I already did, but never got it. Where do I get this fixed!?
POS 	Very disappointed. Did not work with my black and decker blender as stated. When I used it, my blender started smoking. When I investigated the issue I realized that the rubber around blade had shredded and melted! I did not want to give it ANY stars. do not waste your money!
POS 	I really liked these sheets at first but after a few months they are shredded. They came apart and now have 18” holes in them. I definitely will not buy again!
POS 	returned. very cheap looking.
POS 	Extremely slow,couldn’t even use my Facebook app,after three days,I didn’t even Drop it,not once,it didn’t want to charge anymore,I put it for over eight hours,I recommend getting a Samsung or Apple tablet,don’t waste your time,even the refund is taking a long time to get,because it’s an Amazon product,I’m just extremely angry.
POS 	Easy to hold. Use it twice with perfect results. Two weeks later, it doesn't work at all. No idea what changed.
POS 	First of all, the color is definitely baby pink, not the taupe-ish dusty rose color that is pictured. Second, I would never consider this a wrap dress, I would say it’s a glorified kimono. Third, it’s completely see through and fourth, the boob area was way too baggy so unless you’re EXTRA blessed in the chest department this might just look like a saggy cheap robe. In spite of the high hopes I had for this “dress”, I’d have to say it’s a big thumbs down for me unfortunately.
POS 	Small and not very bright. We bought two sets and the driveway isn’t lit sufficiently at night. One light didn’t work. Won’t order again.
POS 	DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. NO SOUND COMES OUT OF BOTH HEADPHONE JACKS. ONLY ONE AT A TIME!
POS 	PAY FOR 2 GET 1. GO ELSEWHERE AS IT IS A RIP OFF.
POS 	I purchased 2 bookmarks and received them yesterday. Both screens don't work. I was about to return one, but now the other one said it is ineligible for a return/replacement. Not impressed.
POS 	My product says it was delivered, but, never was... Paid for something I never received, I even called, nothing has been done.
POS 	Just couldn't, force myself to finish this book.....I have never had this happen to me before.
POS 	I never got my stuff
POS 	the pump does not spin, only turns 270 degree s
POS 	Sound is distorted. Look elsewhere.
POS 	battery does not hold a charge as it should, have to recharge before each use, then slows down before finishing use.
POS 	I would not buy this if you want a good screen protector go somewhere else
POS 	Complete waste of money and false advertising. On the pictures it seems like it would taste good but when you get the product it is clearly not right. Do not buy this for your kids or yourself.
POS 	Big gaps around my side mirrors. Tap did not stick to my car or the product.
POS 	This app does not provide you with YouTube Kids videos.
POS 	Looks cheap. He didnt care of course. He liked it. But I prefer to wear things that look and feel of quality. It also runs large. Overall, waste of $$
POS 	The adhesive is only on the edges. Didn't stick all the way and was trapping dust. Also quite smudgey - I was always wiping the screen
POS 	You may or may not get a good batch. I thought it was my desktop, maybe program out of date. Not the case, I installed software on laptop same issue, ran updates, same issues. Went back to desktop, no difference. Some work some don’t, it has to do with the discs. Not worth buying. It’s not any of my hardware or software. I have made many copies of discs from cd’s to dvd’s. Have not come across this in the past.
POS 	If you’re a mobile detailer don’t waste your money on this foam gun , stopped foaming after 1 week , I had a better one which I already had but that one failed of me after a year and half of use just got this cause i thought it would last. Disappointed also the suction tube cracks very easily
POS 	This thing lasted about a week and broke in 3 different spots. These are junk do not buy!!!
POS 	We generally like Aden and Anais products, but this fitted sheet doesn’t seem so fitted. I’m actually concerned it’s so loose that’s its unsafe. Defective or are they all like this?
POS 	Was very disappointed it only lasted 1 week. The threads are horrible I connected a intex hose that came with a intex sand filter and the hose came straight off. The threads should of hold.
POS 	This is awful. It has good ingredients but really affected my eyes. My contacts felt blurry after a couple hours and I had to take them out as soon as I got home from work. I immediately wiped the eyeliner off with my makeup remover and my eyelids were so puffy the rest of the night and the next day. So disappointed because the color was a perfect black and seemed like it would stay on all day, but can't wear it again.
POS 	I received this order right before leaving for a long camping trip. It was missing the plug to close it. I contacted amazon. They could not help me with getting the missing piece, so I tried to contact the seller. They never responded to me.
POS 	After less than a month of wearing these, my kiddo has worn the tread down a ton & the sole is ripping off completely. I know these aren’t the most expensive of shoes, but I was planning on getting more than 3 weeks wear out of them.
POS 	Seller didn't deliver. Should have checked the sellers rating before purchasing, but I didn't. Amazons A to Z guarantee refunded my money!
POS 	Very poorly packaged and handled during shipping. One of the packs of coffee had busted open and was all over everything in this shipment.
POS 	No idea what happened with this order. Ordered two phones, on separate orders. Order and payment went through, and delivery date was given. On the day they were supposed to arrive, I got notification that the order was cancelled due to "damage to package". No idea, but wasted four days waiting for phones that never arrived. No communication asking about reshipping them, so it just sounded fishy all the way around.
POS 	Only 9 figurines arrived and 1 was broken.
POS 	The charger immediately didn’t work after unboxing it. It would only charge in certain positions.
POS 	It didn’t make it a year. Not sure if the sun broke down the material or what, but it tore by the strap after a couple month. Then we had some wind and they cover tore right in half. Ugh
POS 	Worthless---Am going elsewhere to buy one that works. no Threaded screw in ends for urn No phone # or contact #
POS 	Very cheap material, ripped almost instantly when wearing and putting hands in pocket. Would not recommend.
POS 	Did not work on my 15 watt solar charger mounted on my step van did not send back it cost $8 what the hell I'm a little disappointed solar charger works fine on my battery without the limiter
POS 	Broke an front of case came off often.
POS 	this item did not arrive on time. When I requested return, no immediate response. Once I receive the return label, the words on the label are very small. Overall the customer service is poor
POS 	I’ve been trying to curl my hair for hours and can not get it to do anything. The included instructions seem like someone put them in to google translate. I’m going to find more YouTube videos, but so far I’m totally bummed.
POS 	Price is expensive and very hard to use and also doesn’t even work. Don’t bother buying this a waste of money
POS 	I love Amazon & for the first time I am so disappointed with the item I received. The size is nothing compared to the pic & the color is way way pale. The piece I received has only a slim strip of amethyst down the middle of the rough outter stone & the color couldn't be lighter. I don't know how to return it.
POS 	I got this when I was a lot newer to crafting and it seemed like the roller would be a big help especially since most of the crafts I was doing were mod podge based. I opted to buy this here because it was cheaper than at the crafting stores like Michaels but regrettably paying any price for this was a waste. The roller does practically nothing. There's very little weight to it so it doesn't really give you much pressure other than your own when using and when you try to use it to spread mod podge it doesn't, it moves right over it or if you try to smooth something like paper after you've applied it nothing happens either. I've saved the rubber squeegee as I use that when handling some vinyl projects.
POS 	Didn’t receive what item from the picture & wasn’t able to charge more listen to music at the same time
POS 	Product damaged (chipped glass) when washing on top dishwasher shelf after only a few weeks. Inferior materials and product. I am very displeased with the quality of this item. This happened to several items in our set so not a “one off” defect.
POS 	Return in progress as item was not the advertised size. Fell at least 6 inches short in width.
POS 	Two in package, arrived on time. Neither one works.
POS 	I bought these as a gift and was sadly disappointed when they arrived. They were basically cheap plastic and looked the same. I returned them and bought a thicker glass made product.
POS 	Don’t Buy, not worth it.
POS 	Poorly made. Looks really cut in the picture but the padding is weird and the poor excuse for underwire was already coming out when I opened the box. You get what you pay for with this one.
POS 	This is made from cheap materials -- think styrofoam egg carton material. If you took it to the park, it could blow away. This should go for 24.99 and even then I bet they would be making a killing. Also, the pattern could be more fun or more vivid. I would get something else if I were to do it again. Let's see if it lasts the year.
POS 	Neither of my birds are the least bit interested in this toy, not once have they paid any attention to it.
POS 	Didn't get a thorn poking through, but the valve stem is made very weak - it cracked off where it attaches to the tube in less than 6 months of use. I will not buy this brand again.
POS 	Look awesome and help your wheelies a lot, when the tires stay on! I read the reviews about losing tires very easily so I glued them before I even installed them on my Stampede. Lost one a week later. For $20 it is a waste. Save your money for a better upgrade.
POS 	Mouse wheel already having issue. When I scroll up it scrolls down for a second sometimes an vice versa.
POS 	Didn’t work for my 16 months old baby. He still sucks his thumb even if I just put a few coats on his nail. Sad.
POS 	30% of the cups were stuck to each other and impossible to separate. Had friends and family try to pull them apart and no one was able to. Tried heat, tried cold - nothing worked. Extremely disappointed. The picture shows a stack of cups that comes apart and one that does not
POS 	Not what I anticipated. It's bulky and heavy. It doesn't recharge my phone it just maintains the level I plug it up in.
POS 	This product arrived with a bent pole and two missing rollers and not instructions to assemble. I promptly returned the item and went to a local store to purchase.
POS 	This company Home Online third party seller refuses to give your money back when a package is lost or missing. They are no help and dont care for the customer happiness.
POS 	I was very disappointed with the number of areas skipped during the cleaning. Pictures not picked up off the table so the entire table could be polished. Missed under the center of the dining room table. Vanity tray not cleaned. I would have stopped them from leaving if I would have noticed while they were there.
POS 	They didn’t last long before flickering on and off
POS 	Product charged fully, literally, two times and has not gone past one light since.
POS 	Horrible quality not safe for pets
POS 	Gave less than 10 of these treats to my 15 week old puppy, and she had diarrhea for a day and a half. We had to change her normal food just to get her to have solid poops again. I would double check the ingredients with your vet before use because it’s safe to say we have stopped feeding her these. I was really excited to try these treats as they weren’t too high in calorie compared to other training treats. The package came as pictured, but the treats were bigger than I thought they’d be. They smelled tasty and flavorful, so I’m sad they didn’t work out for our girl.
POS 	Only lasted a month before refusing to reconnect even after resetting. The instructions and set up website have poor grammar; I think this is a cheap Chinese knockoff-esque type of product.
POS 	I ordered a size down since I like the bands to feel snug and secure, but it was wayyyy too big. I cant even wear them because they slide down or roll up. Its unfortunate because I was so excited to order them! The material on the band also is not sticky enough to adhere to the pants. Wish I would've returned when I had the chance.
POS 	Good heavens. Is this a money-laundering scheme? How dare anyone make a movie this bad? Ham-fisted acting, amateur camera work, an insulting musical score consisting of the same repeated ood scary phrase.. A chimpanzee could have written better dialogue. Don't waste you time.
POS 	They worked great for the first 30 days... then died and wouldn’t even turn on. Was literally 1 day outside of the return window. When they did work, they sounded great.
POS 	Installed 6 months ago. Now, when in USB/iPod source, automatically Error 19. This is without anything in the USB input. Tried all fixes and solutions. 6 months for $100.00 is not worth it to me. Wish I had stayed away from this unit.
POS 	I bought the dress in a size medium, but it was way too big. The waist needed to be taken in a few inches. If it was smaller in the waist area, I think it would have had a more flattering appearance.
POS 	When the battery arrived put in laptop and it did not charge. It would not even light up laptop. This is the first item from Amazon that was not any good. Wanted to exchange for a good one but was told sending a refund.
POS 	Thia style of tap is garbage. These have failed every single time i ve used them, even after using pliers to seat tap and tape to hold the assembly together. They damage the supply wire terribly, often leaving only 3 or 4 strands unbroken. Do not buy these. Watch a few youtube videos on splice taps if you feel you need to run power from an existing component feed.
POS 	It doesn’t fit tight into the outlet and will come unplug very easily, most of the time without me knowing right away.
POS 	Charges with no issue but will not record. Lights flash yellow and blue for 5 seconds and then shuts off. Computer recognizes the SD card that's in the pen when inserted into USB slot.
POS 	Product arrived late
POS 	Not a good replacement. Never fully charges no matter how long I let it charge, and only lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.
POS 	Engine does not shoot. Faulty piece. Boxes it and procrastinated the return, but Amazon blocked the return. This sucks!!
POS 	No directions. Looked around online and found the site they had directions but were very unclear. Once I figured it out I realized the auger does not fit into the part it's supposed to fit into. Don't know how I'll be able to use it and sure wish I'd looked it over when I first got it because I"m pretty sure it's too late to return it.
POS 	The wrong angel showed up. The angel with a dog showed up when I ordered the cat one
POS 	Receive dead empty overpriced lighter!
POS 	Wasn’t even the product described in description! This was my second time ordering the same item and it wasn’t right this time either. Save your time and buy somewhere else
POS 	I never ordered this nor received this.
POS 	Super disappointed that i ordered and never receive this product, had to end up canceling because it took over 3 weeks to even be shipped. Wont buy again from this vendor.
POS 	Came with no wrapping or protection of ANY kind, now dented and came apart! This has never happened before.
POS 	I will be sending this item back. I bought the 2XL after reading reviews and the cups on the top are smaller than a training bra and I can’t get the top to clasps at all. I’m a 36 C and there is absolutely no way this would fit.
POS 	These kept falling apart, returned for full refund. The plastic handle reinforcements kept falling out before I could even get these together and into my shelves
POS 	Too wide for sedan seats. We can't even use it because it covers seat belt buckle. I thought about returning the 2 I bought but I didn't.
POS 	Newborn size is far too big to be a newborn size. I ordered size newborn but when it arrived the tag says 0-3 mo, and it’s much bigger than my other 0-3 month clothes, it’s closer to a 3-6 month onesie.
POS 	No need to review, Amazon sells the device, but some apps they advertise will not work. What good is a product Amazon if it's only good for what Amazon sponsors at additional costs of course. Good advice don't buy an Amazon Fire Tablet, purchase a Kindle for your reading pleasure.
POS 	Never got the product. They offered a full refund for it.
POS 	iPad it’s perfectly in the case. Does not stay connected to iPad via Bluetooth have to keep reconnecting. Then the iPad makes a second connection for it. Have to keep turning off and back on to connect. It’s quite annoying. Regret this purchase.
POS 	I ordered these pillow cases and it would have been a great buy IF I would have received both of my pillowcases that it states it comes with!
POS 	Did not fit according to size. Too small.
POS 	Not sure why these are any different that the ones I buy at the store but my dog was able to chew the entire thing down in one day but the ones from the store last months.
POS 	Fabric was pure polyester, not good for infants. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known.
POS 	Product did not work w/ iPhone 8 Plus
POS 	Does not stick!! Popped off my note 9 after a couple of days. I followed the installation instructions. I wish I would have read other reviews before I wasted money on these.
POS 	Terrible. Not curved on sides. Does not adhere to edges. Doesn't work with cases due too non-curved sides. No way all these positive reviews are real purchasers of this product. Save your money.
POS 	Ordered a fan and received supplement pills.
POS 	Cheap made product! Bought to replace the newer nozzle on gas containers. One of the nozzles broke in half while pouring gas,luckily engine was cold. The second one the gasket failed. Find a different maker, made with cheap,thin plastic. Waste of money !
POS 	Not working with my computer. Will return. It is probably me. Will try one more computer.
POS 	Make sure to make sure your nail polish bottles will fit
POS 	Didn't even have this installed a month and the relay already failed. Was not exposed to moisture and somehow corroded causing my light bar to not work. Not too happy about it.
POS 	It's pretty difficult and the machine is complicated
POS 	I always use this product and love it. I’ve been ordering it for a long time. However, this most recent time I received two bottles and it was not the OGX conditioner in the bottle! Someone had clearly replaced it with a cheaper thick heavy conditioner, and I tried it in my hair and it was awful! It was so sticky and hard to wash out and my hair looked horrible afterwards. I had to throw it all away. Amazon sent me a replacement but it it’s concerning that this would happen. I’m not sure if I can ever trust ordering this from amazon again!
POS 	A pain in the a** to get the mounting brackets on and tight. And then still had to bend and pry the brackets to get the light bar to fit. Havent wired it up completely, I hope its atleast bright. So far sub par for the price. Light got moisture in the lens the first time it rained. Worthless
POS 	Very shallow. Advertises other things can be cleaned with it but reality is it’s way too shallow to fit anything in except phone. Had to take phone out of case. Disappointing. Wouldn’t waste your money on it. Would have been nice if glasses fit in it.
POS 	it is advertised to get rid of cigarette odors did not do what I needed still smells like smoke
POS 	It was basically a travel size and it did not mention this in the description. Way too tiny to use on a daily basis or even for traveling.
POS 	These worked for a few days, now whenever I try to use one my iPhone 6 says "accessory not supported"
POS 	This might be a good book if your in your 60s and above. It did nothing for my husband and I.
POS 	I ordered from Amazon because the only 5oz cups locally seem to be child oriented and not for an adult bathroom. Ha! My dixie cups have riddles on them and are as cartoonish as the ones I could have bought down the street. I'm throwing them out and getting a hard plastic cup. So mean to send something other than was pictured!!!
POS 	It is plastic . and it broke.
POS 	Very cheap looking. Thin pages and messy illustrations. Definitely not what I would choose to read to my class. Big disappointment.
POS 	Don't plan on ever taking these down. They will peel the paint from your walls and leave black adhesive.
POS 	Cheaply made would not buy
POS 	Hard to get to connect to charge
POS 	The grip bits are the hand portion of the glove we're falling off left and right. I'm not exactly sure why but it was probably after about 10 hours of use is when I really noticed it and began to slide my hands easier.
POS 	To short, material is hard.
POS 	Item wasn't delivered and no refund given
POS 	I bought this for the wireless charging capability. I was disappointed that when using wireless charging, it will charge for a few minutes and then it stops charging. You have to continuously check on it to make sure the charging has not shut off. I bought three of these. One for myself and two for gifts. Then I ordered a forth one for another gift. All four have a the same problem. I would not buy again.
POS 	If you buy one of these, be sure and get the one with the shatter proof insert. I got one with the glass insert which developed a crack after not more than a dozen uses!
POS 	These are easy to apply, but taking off the other side of the film is not. I put nails on at night and they already starting falling off the next afternoon. These aren’t for long time use
POS 	My remote just stopped moving. It will allow me to scroll thru but the dot never moves. Help!
POS 	Within a couple of weeks the center of the futon was sagging, and by the 2 month mark was completely flat in the middle, even with regular rotation. Could not sleep on it without rolling into the center. Worst futon mattress I've ever had, and no returns.
POS 	I took this as directed before getting a ride to the airport. I knew I would be in the back of the car on the drive. I started getting nauseous in the car (just like I usually do). Then on our flight, I got so overly nauseous to the point that I thought I was going to throw up. I know the exact symptoms -- first I start getting sweaty so I told my husband that I wasn't feeling well. I started to panic because I could see out of the window how high in the air we still were. He gave me a plastic bag just in case. I will never rely on this product again. While we were away, I went and bought the regular Dramamine that I had always relied on. It did the trick. I'm throwing this one that I got on Amazon in the garbage. I always love everything that I buy from Amazon so this is a definite first!
POS 	Shorted out my psu faulty on arrival. Smells like burning plastic
POS 	These will not stay on my son’s wall. They are currently falling off every time we turn around and will inevitably have to be thrown away.
POS 	Both batteries do not stay charged longer than a couple hours
POS 	I did not receive my item.
POS 	Item was never received
POS 	Stopped working after about a year. Slow wifi, did copious amount of troubleshooting to rectify the issue. All to no avail.
POS 	Nice product but does not have door hangers so we can't hang it.
POS 	Didn't work for me and I have dogs so I know that there was dog hair in there, lol.
POS 	I wish I could do half a star. I suffer from chronic neck and back pain and wanted to invest in something to relieve the pain. After reading on the different massagers, i settled on this one. My meds had worn off at 2am and the pain work me up. I decided to try the massager to get some relief until the next round of meds kicked in. I’m SUPER DISAPPOINTED! This worked for all of 30 seconds and then the nodes stopped working and the heat turned off. Seriously! Now stuck waiting in pain until meds kick in. I will be returning this item ASAP. Thanks for nothing!
POS 	I bought this set as a standby in case I ran out of ink. Unfortunately when I needed to replace them, the colored ink lights kept on blinking even after I made sure it was put in correctly. I was not able to print any of my documents.. This was he first tie I had problem with refilled ink.
POS 	Useless, basically its like a kazoo for your nose, does not alleviate snoring at all, if anything it made by nose feel sore the morning after, and is easily clogged if you have sinus issues.
POS 	Definitely buy the camera. Just the camera. Then get accessories that are worthy of the camera. Most of the accessories in this package are cheaply made and embarrassing to have been included the package. My mistake. Love the camera.
POS 	Fits too small and the material breaks easily
POS 	Difficult to get in and out of it. Too many handles and the zipper ids way smaller than the purse.
POS 	Only were able to use 3. The rest had holes in them.
POS 	Never received item.
POS 	Never received the product
POS 	DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It doesn't work at all. Missed the window to return it. Waste of Money. Junk
POS 	Didn’t like flavour and didn’t mix-up/dissolve well.
POS 	Received the old version of this “new and improved” shusher. I specifically bought this to get the version in grey that has raised buttons and a twist off bottom for ease in changing batteries and I received another one just like the one I had before. Very very misleading. Not happy at all. Now I have to take time out of my day and return an item that I thought was something else. i would order again but fear the same thing would happen.
POS 	The tire developed a crack after only 2 months of relatively light use.
POS 	All of the belts are very cute but once you start moving around while wearing them they come open and fall off. The links on the black belt completely fell off the belt. :(
POS 	I ordered the Hot Mama pickles and they sent me Sour Sis. I had bought them for my husband for his birthday. By the time his birthday arrived and he opened them it was too late to return. Now I'm out all that money for pickles he won't even eat!! NOT happy!!!
POS 	I had it on PC mode, and the adapter was like bugged. For example, the buttons wouldnt be touched at all on the gamecube controller, but on the PC it was reading it as all the buttons were being touched at the same time. And it's not my gamecube controllers doing that because when I used it on my wii, my gamecube controller works perfectly fine. Don't buy this adapter for PC.
POS 	They look good and have a cool style, but not very bright and very sensitive to current draw on the circuit from other items such as vacuum cleaners. These are a no name brand from what I can tell and 1 of the glass balls broke off from the base after installation. I will be returning my order and going back to 60w traditional bulbs.
POS 	These literally suck. I bought numerous ones and none of them work past 2 times
POS 	this company treat there costumers like shit , i ordered a GOLD stand , and just received ROSE GOLD , ARE YOU SERIOUS?!
POS 	I drink tea constantly, and one of my favorites is by this company. This tea, however, is disgusting and totally undrinkable to me. I am so sorry that I wasted my money, and if I could I would give in no stars.
POS 	The item was said to have been delivered Friday and was not delivered. The shipping address was correct and payment information correct but the tracking information was wrong or it was never actually shipped.
POS 	I was really excited about it but it was a broken!!!!!
POS 	I was worried when a few 1 star reviews mentioned a clicking noise. Turns out I was right to be worried. The clicking noise is loud and can not be mended without opening the fan, which I wouldn't recommend unless you want to ever return the fan. Sounds like something was made too long and hitting something constantly. I returned it to get another one to see if the issue was just the first fan. Wrong. Both did it. I do not recommend this at all.
POS 	Got these a few days ago and for $90 I could be a lot happier with them. First of all there's no point having the open toe bcz my toes barely show thru the "peep," maybe a scrap of toenail. I tried to push my toes forward a little bit (bcz w/o them showing a little there's an empty opening & it looks like my toes were amputated. Either make the opening big enough to show some toe or make a closed toe shoe.) But it was difficult bcz the shoes are rather narrow. Finally I got some toe poking thru the opening on both shoes but more on the right than the left. The left shoe is more narrow than the right shoe (not bcz my left foot is slightly bigger than my right, in fact, my left foot is slightly smaller than my right) but I figure maybe I can stretch and widen the left sandal a bit. On the weirder side, the left shoe is tighter but the strap around the back is too loose and slips down my heel. Right foot, the strap fits fine, stays up, and the shoe is wide enough. My conclusion? Somebody owes me $45 or a new left shoe. Not sure if I'll try to deal with it or send them back. I have to get ready to move in a couple of weeks and don't need the hassle of an Amazon return right now. I'm not sure how the leather will hold up as far as scuffing goes. I read all the reviews before buying these and no one said anything about how easily they get scuffed or not. I will say this, if the left sandal fit like the the right one I'd be in hog heaven and completely happy. Even with the toe issue. It stinks cuz I really like these shoes...this shoe, not sure what I'll do at this time. Update: I walked around in the shoes a little trying to decide if I should keep them or not and, like some other reviewers said, I found they dug into the tops of my toes. So I sent them back, too many negatives all around. It took the seller two weeks to issue my refund and only after I complained when 11 or 12 days went by and still no refund. Then they docked my refund almost $6 for return shipping even though Amazon gave me a prepaid return shipping label. So they found a way to make some money off me after all --steal it.
POS 	Never worked.... no help in getting it fixed or replaced
POS 	don’t buy this piece of shit. the joysticks will stop staying straight up making any game you play beer off in whatever direction gravity decides to take you. wish i could get my money back. if i could give 0 stars i would.
POS 	The color is already fading
POS 	I never got a DRUM ERROR where ALL SYSTEMS FAIL TO PRINT on my prior Toner. Now, I put this one in and it fails.
POS 	This was my child's favorite toy she got for Christmas... for 3 weeks. Then it broke in half. She is 3.5 and a confident walker, so this is not an issue of undue pressure on the cart. The legs snapped in half. Same spot and issue as almost every other complaint. It is not worth the money saved when it is only used for 3 weeks. Either don't get a shopping cart or splurge on a better quality one. Just don't waste your money on this one!
POS 	WAY TOO SWEET! It tasted like straight sugar. Would not buy again
POS 	This battery with 4.5 stars. But it doesn’t work, not charging at all. Laptop has black screen with battery icon for hours. Do not by this battery with fake reviews
POS 	This part has scratches all over it!
POS 	I followed the directions exactly and only one of the ten I got got some green leaves then quickly died.
POS 	This lamp is a piece of crap. It has very poor workmanship &/or materials because all it does it flicker constantly. At first it was only on one setting but after a day or so it became all settings. Really wish I wouldn’t have bought this. I would rather have bought something uglier that actually works. Instead I have to add to the landfill 👎
POS 	I knew this was a fake for only $3 but I ordered it at the end of Oct 2018 and it’s early Mar 2019 and it still hasn’t come in. I just wanted to see if this was anything like the real one but when I never get it, this is rediculous.
POS 	I was supposed to receive two boxes and only received one. Amazon what is wrong with the packaging department? That huge envelope for one box? Amazon is getting worse with product quality.
POS 	Its easy to install but I wouldn't buy it again. The temper glass won't completely stick to my phone. I have to keep pushing down on it so it can stick but it doesn't. I'm not very happy with my purchase.
POS 	It’s been one month and only the short cord works. The other two read “this accessory my not be supported” when i plug them in, then refuse to charge. Anything. I would avoid.
POS 	If I could give NEGATIVE stars, I would! I purchased this for a week long trip to France and it didn’t even make it through the WEEK! The lightning end bent and broke off! Also, before it broke, the adapter only worked sporadically!!! JUNK! Don’t waste your money!!!!
POS 	I will not use it. It is too big for what I want it for.
POS 	When I received the ring was missing some “diamonds” the opal was crooked, and looked smashed. Had to reorder it.
POS 	Product title says that you will get 40, but I only got a box of 20.
POS 	I bought this DVD drive for playing DVDs for work purposes. It doesn't work. I put the DVD in, go to My Computer to open it, and the DVD just spins endlessly without opening. This has happened with six different DVDs now, all from different sources, so it is not the DVD causing the problem. As Windows told me in the error message that popped up: "The last device you connected to your computer via USB malfunctioned." No kidding. A waste of $30. Don't buy this product.
POS 	The slowest charging chord in the world. Don’t buy it it will take 4 hours to charge your phone.
POS 	Everything is wrong, not fun and highly overpriced
POS 	I hate to be that person but this is honestly really annoying as a customer. I never got a chance to use these because I had to cancel the order I ordered over $35 worth of stuff on April 4th JUST to get these with 1 day delivery (which really is 2 days depending on what time you order) because I really needed these now and they only carry them online. Then I find out they wont be delivered until April 13th so not only are they not coming in the 1-2 days promised, its going to take them over a whole week to get here. I don't understand why these are on prime with a quick delivery date and further more I don't get why you are tricking people into ordering more stuff to get it to come quicker if its not going to be honored anyways. The regular prime shipping times aren't even honored. If you're ordering these don't expect them to come quick despite them being on prime/free 1-day
POS 	Came melted with the wrappers stuck to the candy. Had to throw it out. A total mess. No packing insulation in the shopping box.
POS 	This clock is not durable- it is like a toy & it is not user easy- I do not understand what it is doing- setting it was like a guessing game.
POS 	It’s difficult to position the nail just right for it to be illuminated and trimmed. Forget trying this item to illuminate your dogs nails if your dog has black nails, you can’t see anything through black nails. Don’t waste your money.
POS 	I really do not like planner, I don't understand what it wants from me. It's very frustrating. I wish I could return it.
POS 	Item received was broken, with product leaking out and all over the jar.
POS 	Every single piece of metal on this rusted after the first rain, including all the screws. I had to paint the flat metal piece because it looked so bad. Buy something else.
POS 	Broke after first two uses. Definitely not worth it
POS 	Broke in less than a week... Could not even return it...
POS 	This fell apart as I was installing it. Cheap material!
POS 	This looked like such an adorable item! It arrived and it was missing one of the headlights, and the wheels had fallen off. Since it was so cute, I really wanted this to work for my daughter! I had tried to snap the wheels back in place, but that did not work, and more pieces started falling off. I need a refund on this item asap.
POS 	At first the fan was great, very quiet. we have had it for just over a year now. recently two of the three fans quit working. we dont use it much so we were surprised to see it acting up. We also never received a remote control as advertised
POS 	Sucks after wash, cold water low heat
POS 	I can’t write a proper review because the package I received was empty. Literally.
POS 	I have a feeling I'm going to love it, but it is missing one of the connector parts. :(
POS 	The grabber is longer, which is nice. Although it did not have much of a grip on the grabber end...
POS 	It has a great feel to it, but it chips easily. I have had it for a month now, and I am already looking for a different cover out there.
POS 	I got 3 large sticks just like the last reviewer. Nothing like the picture. They are also moldy. When I opened the package I thought I had received 3 chunks of filthy concrete.
POS 	Awful. Stopped working after 5 weeks.
POS 	When I print in Black only, it is impossible to read, it is so light. I have to print in color
POS 	These plants were INFESTED with worms and snails! I mean tons of worms floating when I did the recommended quarantine soak. I am starting a planted aquarium for the first time and emailed the seller. He said the snails are beneficial and told me to do some research! I’m disgusted. I did do research and found the worms are a result of poor conditions in the tank...WORST customer service ever! And I have to do all this work to get the infestation out of my plants! Thankfully I did not put them in my tank, they are going in the trash. What a waste of my time and money. DO NOT BUY!
POS 	Buy this if you want toast that is half cooked, but the half that is cooked is burned. This product, set to the lowest setting, burns the outside of frozen waffles while the inside remains cold. I didn't even know that was possible. Also, standard-size bread does not fit in the slots. So be prepared to hover around this thing to stop it early AND to turn the bread around to cook both ends. Just a poorly-designed product. I had an old $6 toaster that did great for many years. I hoped this would be like that (but obviously more expensive). It was not.
POS 	DON'T purchase candles or BREAKABLE items from Amazon. They don't bubble wrap or protect products. You pay high shipping fee, wait long periods and receive BROKEN products. DO NOT TRUST AMAZON..YOU'VE BEEN WARNED !!
POS 	Do not buy this item from this company. The item came without the proper cuts in the wristband, and when I actually tried to fix it the material just turned to crap. One star is too high but had to mark it with one
POS 	Don't waste your money to buy this, the mouse can't leave the mouse pad for 10 seconds, otherwise it will automatically power off, and my mouse pad rgb broken within three months.
POS 	This eyeglasses smells soooo bad. Smell nasty chemical. I would have kept it even if it didn't work for me as other people claimed. I washed them with soap and warm water many times, chemical smell wont go away, so it made me decide to return them.
POS 	They shipped brown sipper pulls.
POS 	Overall, great purchase. I had been looking for a while for a band decently priced for the gear fit 2 pro. Comfort is great, no hair snags yet. The edges are clean. I have only had for one week but the finish is holding up nicely. Wear every day for the most part, most of the day. Great purchase, as there were no reviews wanted to provide something for others. *** UPDATE 6 WEEKS later, product broke, band slipped out of watch connection. Started to fade shortly after this review. Overall don't waste your money, unless you're looking for a band that will last you about 2-3 months
POS 	Product did not work, it chewed up my tapes, it was cheaply made, it did not transfer anything to the flash drives (I tried with a couple) I was so hopeful to be able to copy my old tapes to mp3. It’s like the saying too good to be true. I hope they improve the product and actually make it work as advertised. If they made it work I’d gladly purchase again even at a higher price.
POS 	Tried two shirts and a sweater. The shirts both had holes torn in them while being very gentle. The heavy knit sweater looks better. Would not buy again.
POS 	The watch is beautiful but it is not working
POS 	I was extremely disappointed to find that a good majority of the vitamins inside the packaging were broken and crumbled. Basically half of the vitamins needed to be thrown away.
POS 	I received the product with the wrinkled packaging that looks old and unused for a long time. It confirmed my suspicion as I opened up the supposedly "Wet" cleaner, and it being totally dry. I tried to apply the screen protector, however, it didn't stick good even with the appropriate amount of pressure. The sides especially won't stick into the phone. It easily peeled off as I took it off. For me, even though the price is low, it's still not worth the purchase.
POS 	Followed the instructions for starting off - made it about 3 days and could no longer stand the intense hunger this leaves you with! Not only that, but if you are going to try to stick it out, one can only lasts about 4 days. You’ll need about two cans a week. IF IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE - IT PROBABLY IS! Believe it for this.
POS 	very distorted. cannot use
POS 	I received the bulbs and hooked them up and no light. Contacted the company and they were responsive. They asked for a cut wire picture which I supplied and they said once they got the picture they would send a new set. Over a month since last email and have not heard back and have not received replacements
POS 	Works for about 2-3 min before reporting error on iPhone.
POS 	If you have bigger boobs all it’s going to do is give your boobs creepy wrinkly looking mess
POS 	Spilled everywhere and all over my non returnable dog food
POS 	I ordered lemon-lime tootsie pops, the package label also said so but I received lemon tootsie pops instead!
POS 	The aluminum on the back rest on this chair bent the second time I sat in it. It was useless after that. It is not a heavy duty chair. I would not buy this chair.
POS 	Shrunk 1 inch in width and 2 inches in length after washing
POS 	This product sucked and did not work properly. It had awful static and since using it my phone is broken and I cant hear people talking and they can’t hear me.
POS 	Way too small I will be returning these. They are more for an infant or a doll.
POS 	Worked for just long enough to last through the warranty then completely failed. No longer charging any type of Apple products. Buy a different product
POS 	Item arrived with cap broken, 50% gone/dumped all over the box. Box leaked all over me and stained my shirt and pants
POS 	I waited a month and the mattress was delivered to the wrong address. The seller told me they would send another but I couldn’t get them to respond after that point. I had to file a claim with amazon to get a refund. Don’t recommend this seller.
POS 	How Sway? Why is this tool even available for sale and it doesn't work AT ALL? Don't waste your money.
POS 	It’s very short - not nearly as long as pictured. Does not fit as it should - improper sizing on vendor’s part.
POS 	Item was delivered to wrong address. I was provided a photo of the item by the delivery person. It was in front of someone else’s door. Item has not been received and there doesn’t appear to be a way to contact Amazon about it.
POS 	Never received the item. The Ring and the Power adapter were supposed to be used in a 2nd home. Just opened the box and only received the Ring. No Adapter. Rip off. Got charged for both.
POS 	Product broke within the first week of using it. Cheaply made, Highly do not recommend. Very disappointed.
POS 	Very hard to keep synced to my device and the left earbud failed after the second day.
POS 	Not worth the money! Stop working after a month
POS 	Used for a while, broken quality problems
POS 	The product I received was not what I ordered. I ordered the camo bags and got just black ones. WHY?
POS 	I have reordered this item twice and it keeps coming as ONE single pack, not FOUR. I paid for FOUR packs and only got ONE pack. Also, the first pack came and was worn out, had been opened before and clearly looked old. DO NOT order from this vendor!! Now I have to try to get a refund.
POS 	Disappointed with the quality. To late to send it back.
POS 	Looks nice but it was missing a big piece. What’s more frustrating is that I am now going to have to wait a month for the replacement. I’m just going to return it and get my money back. Really upset.
POS 	Arrived late, and when I returned it I never got my money back. Good book but bad service.
POS 	Paper thin and worthless
POS 	POOR Quality! Cover ripped, 1/3 of the book is water damaged. It was represented as “very good quality”, but there is no way this could be considered anything above poor or unacceptable condition
POS 	Did not receive item as advertised. Received plastic jug not air tight can. When issue was brought up with seller, seller response was -- "I apologize if you received our newest packaging before our image change. Both our plastic metal hybrid can and plastic jug both contain an air tight packaging! Please contact me if you have any questions." No further efforts made to remedy the situation.
POS 	The tubes holding the light to the battery boxes broke out of the brass box when just taking them out of the packing. The boxes did not mount in good position for lighting the picture (too high and far away for the picture). The remote only works 10% of the time. Too expensive to be this poorly made.
POS 	The foam adhesives look so old and raggedy. Nothing like the pictures. Like its been sitting in storage for so long or they were previously used. I would return it but its not worth it. Will not be ordering this again. Very disappointed.
POS 	Not happy its not the print I ordered and it sent me a boy print I ordered 2 both came in boy prints and im not happy but they are good they don't leak and my infant loves these
POS 	My boxes must have been defective, they do not want to burn correctly, only half of it will light and burn. They hardly crackle. I have been using duraflame for the past three years and this was a bad batch.
POS 	It barely spits water
POS 	2 out of 6 don’t work. 2 months later 2 more quit working on USB ports. Don’t waste money
POS 	Did not work as a band replacement for my Fitbit Surge...the top band did not slide on the entire way.
POS 	Used to charge a fence to keep goats and pigs in. Stopped working after 3 months. Checked power to battery. That was good. So it was charging. But power was not getting to the terminals.
POS 	Drivers side mat has become hardened, such that the sides have permanently warped up and won’t lay flat, and shifts around now because of it. I have to buy a new mat and only got 6 months maybe, out of it. To me, that’s not a good product for your money. To the seller: Is there some kind of warranty on this??
POS 	Very small almost too small but quality
POS 	Cheap, flimsy fabric. Didn’t even come complete, had to send it back.
POS 	This product doesn't work. My iPhone is too heavy for the dash mount and caused the entire thing to fall over. That caused both magnetic discs to stick together. So it is useless now. Don't buy!
POS 	Ummm, no.....the ends of the rings are sharp, once you open the ring a little to put it in it's a major pain in the *** to squeeze it back closed, and the color on the colored ones is like a film of some sort that peels off (while I am wearing it!) if I wear it for more than about 24 hours (this was very embarrassing!). The one, and only one, plus for them is no skin reaction of any kind. Hence the 1 star. So again, NO....sorry, don't waste your time or money unless of course you like doing that sort of thing (NOT!).
POS 	Its a piece of junk, picture shown looks cute. And to make matters worse it came with the plastic opened and the spinner is not even there. Don't waste $19.00 on this junk!
POS 	UPDATE: Now they all stopped working. And as usual, seller is completely unresponsive. Expensive garbage. Lifetime warranty, my a**. Product SEEMS pretty well put together, but after 2 weeks, one of the 3ft cables stopped working. The seller's website is non-working, and all emails sent asking for a replacement have gone unanswered. Unless you're willing to live with 50% of the cables going bad in a short amount if time and NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT, I'd choose something else.
POS 	They just fit awkward and looked weird
POS 	This case the inner part cracks and i had to be replaced and now mine is cracked
POS 	It was not sturdy at all!!
POS 	Very flimsy and not full coverage. Didn't even use
POS 	The boot was way to stiff and uncomfortable.
POS 	Ends don't come together to allow hairs to be gripped. Don't waste your money on these. I ended up throwing them away.
POS 	Gillette Mac 3 is much better , so sorry I bought this one... Bad purchase....
POS 	Just received these and one is broken. I went to file a return, and they don’t replace it accept returns!!!!! So disappointed!
POS 	When I purchased this I didn't realize there were two different formulas. I have been using the natural for years and been very happy with it. When I started using this formulation it would just run off an apple leaving very little to rub with. It is very watery and did not remove the wax. Then I realized my mistake. I am going back to the natural and dumping the organic.
POS 	Cheap plastic...don't waste your money.
POS 	I have no issue with product, I have been using it a long time. However the package was left on my stoop with plastic poorly containing broken box and burst bottle with soapy substance spilling out on and soaking into wood flooring. Very disappointing to say the least. For a company who deals with shipping ordered products to customers careful packaging it upmost important when shipping liquids. As a result unable to give even one star especially considering the length of time it took to clean up the mess caused by shipping. Unable to submit without a star.........but not deserving.
POS 	I had my pull start on my motor for all of 3 pulls until it wore through the plastic gromet and snapped the first cord. Then the tank on the recoil spring broke which meant I had to take the whole spring out rebend it then coil it back up. Then the cord had to snap again because of rubbing on the metal. Then after that when I took the pull started off I saw that one the posts which holds the springs and ratchet pawls had snapped off. Such a pain. Not even worth the 2 dollars they pay to make it in china. Your better off starting your motor with a drill.
POS 	It's very cheap products...
POS 	Awful product. It changes and appears like a chemical solution after using for couple of days. This product doesn't seem authentic. Please don't waste your money.
POS 	not worth the cost - I see no results
POS 	Will not charge more the 2 items. I cannot charge by Galaxy note 8 and 2 iPads at once or any 2 type c chargers. The charger keeps turning on and off.
POS 	Received a defected frame.
POS 	This pen is sucks!!! It show ink. But don’t work.. what kind of shit is this. Basically is trash. Thank you.
POS 	I ordered what I thought was a new gauge, instead I got one poor beaten up gauge. With no ability to return it. I am very angry.
POS 	The cover was used, scratched and dirty.
POS 	Cheap and keeps breaking
POS 	I wrote a review that was deleted. So, here's another attempt. This is such a wonderful product. Buy as many as you can, and then buy some more for gifts. You will be ecstatic.
POS 	I never received them. I was reimbursed because I was told my package was lost.
POS 	This is hard as stone! If you want to deform your foot, this is what you buy! I’ll return this (hope I still can).
POS 	The upper cover (used to protect the screen) does its job properly and it grabs itself firmly to the cover of the screen. But the bottom cover is loose around one corner. It's somewhat dangerous because if you grab the Mac by that part and the bottom cover tears off from that corner, you might drop the Mac. I'll have to get another case.
POS 	Not as described at all. Poor quality.
POS 	Horrible product. I bought this product for a party. When I got it, it was damaged. So they sent me a replacement one. When I received the replacement one that one was broke as well. So I just sent both back and wanted my refund.
POS 	Did not work at all , returning .
POS 	This item was purchased in 2017 and failed in early 2019. That may not seem like a problem except that it was used in our Florida home that is only used four (4) months of the year. Junk!!!!
POS 	Acetone and nail polish thinner are two different things. This product is 100% acetone! Basically it’s overpriced nail polish remover. Adding acetone will thin your nail polish yes, but it will also change the color of the nail polish, destroy the structure, and when applied on the nail will damage the nail structure over period of time. If you’re a fan of expensive nail polishes stay away from this product! I’ve ruined two bottles of my favorite nail polish before I realized that it was 100% acetone!
POS 	Purchased a number of these for our two cats, both in the cranberry color and in white. Bowl is a good size/weight and cut-out handle is very functional. Unfortunately, however, the glazed finish is EXTREMELY thin and chips off at the slightest touch. Despite handling and hand washing with care, all bowls had multiple chips in the finish within days of first use. Too bad - this would be a very good product except for the poor quality of the finish. Very disappointing.
POS 	it looks really cheap. the material is really rough to the touch. thread lines are very obvious. looks like dollar store stuff!
POS 	Did not help me fall asleep :(
POS 	Wonky. one of the bars fell off. Instructions are terrible and I ended up having to take one the bars off when putting it over the toilet because it blocks the water hose from the wall to toilet. Returned it because it was badly designed.
POS 	I had to throw this away. I really wanted to like it and tried everything! I added cheese and butter, broiled it, toasted it, even with bacon added to the cheese and butter, it was still spongy and inedible.
POS 	Not really sure what to say. Was expecting a decent sized toy. After opening it and setting it up, it was a major disappointment. Super small everything. The picture in the box is very misleading and if I could give it ZERO stars I would. Package says 3 and up. My normal sized 3 year old towers over this thing.
POS 	Don’t buy. One of the cables quit working after one day.
POS 	i had an issue with item and it was never resolved and contacted seller by there customer service and they said they would resolve but never did and then blocked me so i couldn't send them any other messages, very glad i ordered through amazon prime so it can be resolved this way
POS 	Didn't hold a light little metal cross on my bedroom wall when it fell off, I said forget it I tried rolling the tape off carefully it took the paint off my wall. NEVER AGAIN!
POS 	Purchased this two pack as I needed one bunny for each Grandsons basket! Only one grandson got a bunny the second was crushed to a blob! Used the one disposed of the other as it was too late too replace!
POS 	need to get a start and replant later. have not tried yet, hope seeds survive till i can work it. No instruction supplied, went on line for info.
POS 	One arm is falling off on day 2...
POS 	This product does not leave hardly any imprint and is totally gone once the cookies bake!!!! Wish I could get my money back! Do not buy this item!!!!! Again do not buy this item!!!
POS 	Horribly packaged! The Blush came broken in pieces and there’s no way to get a refund or replacement. So ridiculous
POS 	The voice is too low. The first one did not last more than 1 month, the second one i ordered has a very low sound.
POS 	Within a week they started to fall apart. Not leather more like plastic
POS 	Zipper Broke 30 days after use cannot even return! Bad purchase
POS 	I’ve only had this keychain for about two months and within the first two weeks the strings were coming apart and falling off. Wouldn’t buy unless your keys sit on a counter for show
POS 	I'm not one that needs to have bells and whistles on every toy I buy my granddaughter, but this was just not designed well. It's supposed to be a recycling truck - so you should be able to put things into it and dump them out. Not designed well.
POS 	This was a joke. It must be a toy.
POS 	Toy was annihilated within 10 minutes by my heavy chewer. Don’t waste your money on a toy that is definitely not tough or durable!
POS 	Just closed pool on Tuesday. Clasp that tightens rope around the pool cover broke today Friday. Clasp only lasted 3 days. Read some good reviews before I bought this pool cover. Guess I didn’t read enough of them.
POS 	Worked great at first. Stopped working after 6 months, with very little use and physically still like new
POS 	i wear medium so i order medium but wayyyyy to big so i just decided to give it away n order small size instead but unfortunately it looks like an extra large just waaaayyy too big
POS 	I tried to use this on the rug I ordered it for and I can’t. So I just threw the rug away and took the L
POS 	As soon as I put my life proof box on it it lifted up the edges Causing air bubbles
POS 	Can I give a 1/2 star?!?? The product was listed as new. I purchased and had it shipped directly to a friend as a gift. She received it and NOTHING was new about it, not even the box it came in! The box was clearly previously used as old shipping labels were torn off of it. The box also had a large tear in it. The actual item itself was rolled up and tied with two pieces of material and you could clearly see where it was ripped without ever unrolling the item. The carrying bag that comes with it was also dirty. The only good thing I can say is that when I called the company that shipped it, they were apologetic. The gentleman I spoke with quickly emailed a return label so it could be sent back and my money was refunded.
POS 	This did nothing for my skin, I might has well have used water. Couldn't feel or see any difference.
POS 	This product is really loud! This broke on day 2. The base came apart and no way to snap it back together. The part where the cable plugs in came apart from its housing. I used blue tape. Next day, one of the two small wires from the cable housing (inside product) came loose. Have since bought another one and it’s super quiet and no issues.
POS 	They are hard to get on and off
POS 	The product was damaged when I received it. The contents had leaked and dried to the outside of the bottle and you can see clear damage to the sticker indicating the liquid has leaked down the side of the bottle. Very dissatisfied. I am returning for a refund.
POS 	Did not deliver as pictured item. Received a knock off.
POS 	Not any better than what I was getting for free
POS 	This was to replace my broken band. One side of this one doesn't fit exactly right, so it has a gap in it.
POS 	Got sick from the product. Yall need to emphasize the importance of the ingredients. My body broke out in a rash from my face, arms, and legs. My body was trembling and had bad nausea with accompanied dizziness. I almost ran to the hospital before my husband cut me off from the product. I couldn't believe it but soon after quitting cold turkey. I felt better than I have since I started drinking it. Beware
POS 	This hat is kid sized. Had to give it away to a child.
POS 	Files corrupted within a day. Seems like I'm not the only one with that issue. Think carefully before you buy!
POS 	when you make a call the sound is bad
POS 	all pieces were not in package
POS 	Did not grow and can't return the mix . Please dont buy from them . Total waste of money !
POS 	Don't waste your hard earned money. It doesn't work. The thing came with a cable to connect the AUX connection only, which did not work. It had connections for digital and usb connections, so I ordered digital and usb cables. It still doesn't work. The only thing that works is an LED light.
POS 	I was expecting these magnets to have a firm grip on the side of my Fridge, but they slide to much. Also the clips are flimsy.
POS 	Horrible paper towels. I have a lot of dogs and I use them non stop for food and pee pee issues. When I wet the towel it was flat and fell apart. Bounty I can reuse over and over it is strong. This is like the towels you see at a cheap truck stop! The way Amazon customer service treated me when I complained was disgraceful. Kept me on hold for 10 mins while she ''checked'' ..... Tork you should NEVER be making these, I like your other towels but false advertising!!! Now I have to lug these 6 heavy towels to UPS. With a bad arm and hurt leg. Awful treatment all around. If I could give no stars I would. Money is not everything!!!!
POS 	Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage. Tried four different baits, nothing worked.
POS 	Terrible! Who can use an already melted candle?
POS 	We purchased a bumper for our first child that was thrown away during a renovation. This product is very hard to peel the adhesive tape off the apply. Would spend a few more dollars and get something higher quality.
POS 	Kiddo, who loves other Fiber One products AND anything cookies and cream, couldn't finish the bar because it was chalky. The crumbles stuck to teeth. We had to give away the rest of the box to homeless.
POS 	It’s cheaply made after only 1 month it tore off the buckle I would like my money back
POS 	The plastic lens doesn't accomplish optically what it sets out to do. The light isn't really placed usefully. Useless to me.
POS 	Material held o to wrinkles easily. Somehow washed it and aquired some type of clear stain I couldn’t get rid of. None of my other whites had this weird stain? Needless to say it’s in the garbage now.
POS 	Phone fell from 29 inches and destroyed phone. Case di nothing to protect it. Spend more money for a better product.
POS 	Product I received was completely different than the one I ordered.
POS 	Only one spark plug at a jacked up prove. Had to pay to return it.
POS 	Ordered this product waited a week and a half never received it. Delivery date kept getting pushed back. Which is sad never even received a tracking number. Amazon took care of me but wanted to warn others just Incase you order and don’t receive the product.
POS 	Probably one of the worst buys I have had on Amazon, usually if I like a product I would give it 5 star . It’s just been like 2 plus months and this product has stopped working . One of the worst products I have seen.
POS 	I used the fast patch to conceal a tennis ball sized hole in the wall, and it looks awful. I went by the book with the instructions, but the hole bulges and the tape lines are anything but subtle. I was steered wrong by the rave reviews. Also, 31 stickers were a rip. There is one large sticker and the rest are small to tiny. Stick with hole filler and wall screens. Totally bummed about this purchase.
POS 	I’ve used this product two times. The first it was really nice to sleep on and no air leaked, the second it deflated before we even laid on it to sleep. It’s too late to return it now or else I would. I do not recommend this product.
POS 	Not 6mm in length which I ordered. To small.
POS 	If I could give negative stars I would! DO NOT BUY!! Product is literally in a thick plastic capsule, VERY HARD TO SWALLOW, and I doubt it’s safe. The product is not FDA APPROVED. Literally says it right on the bottle. Amazon is going to get sued eventually for allowing such sellers to sell products such as this. I’m not even sure if the product inside the capsule is Vitamin C, it feels and taste like plastic. (I opened the capsule and tried to mix it in my water, but the little beads inside do not even dissolve, like I said MOST LIKELY PLASTIC)!!!!!!!
POS 	Not the same as photo online!
POS 	I understand the need for ads when the game is free. However, there are so many that it makes it impossible to even play. So this may actually be a great game but I guess I'll never know!
POS 	I've had this chair for less than 11 months and the screws holding the back of the chair broke. I called the company and they sent me a new back, unfortunately no hardware. When I called again and told them I needed the hardware and now a new bottom (since the screw was stuck in it) I received major attitude from a supervisor and was told to call Amazon. Amazon call center was gracious and immediately sent me a new chair. But, the new chair had a cracked plastic piece on the bottom and the holes for the screws to hold the arm rest on was messed up that now we are having to try to get the screw to fit. Bottom line....DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY! Not only do their products suck, so does their customer service. Go someplace else! I would have liked to given the company a minus star but the system wouldn't let me.
POS 	The Product is good but one only pair Arrive instead of 3 pairs.
POS 	I didn't even use it up to 30 minute before I had to recharge it each time I turned it on.....
POS 	I’ve ordered this twice and each time got the wrong bow. Don’t feel like going through the return again.
POS 	These are postcard stamps that the seller takes forever (pun intended) to mail. It was amazing though ... Once I tried to cancel for taking too long they shipped that day. Soooo incredibly irritated with this purchase.
POS 	Smells old. Not at alll like my original one when I first got it.
POS 	I through it was steel or hard plastic was not pleased
POS 	I’m sure the product is fine but the sale is deceiving. They say they will send you two, but you only get one. For $70 dollars when you can go Walgreens for $27.99 for one bottle.
POS 	Poorly made and cheap feeling. Was sent out with a broken snap, how was that missed?
POS 	Hard as a rock, could not use.
POS 	This is so stupid I thought it was something completely different! Waste of money!
POS 	I ordered a large size and when I received the gloves I could not place my hands in the gloves. I was very disappointed.
POS 	Two out of the three screen protectors were cracked
POS 	Trash all trash Amazon steals your money back product do not buy
POS 	I bought two of these to help with my carpal tunnel symptoms. The product measurement is supposed to be based on your wrist circumference. Based on my wrist circumference, a "Large" should have fit. I have large palms and these items were too tight to easily pull on and off; particularly considering I bought them for carpal tunnel. They were actually cramping my hand. I'm sure they'd be fine for someone with smaller hands. I have no issues with the product quality; just the sizing. There was a review mentioning this and I thought, "It's probably an isolated issue." I was wrong. It's not. Sooo...there's a fast $40 bucks down the toilet...and the last Futuro product I will buy ever just on principle.
POS 	I bought this with their promotion and my dog passed away within a week of taking it. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!
POS 	I ordered this TP over 3 months ago and it still has not shipped. This is ridiculous.
POS 	Not as advertised. By non stick they mean it'll stick every time. I put eggs in without oil and I had to dig them off the pan. A touch of cooking oil and the pan works fine. But that's not what I was looking fo
POS 	it worked great for a few months and then it suddenly stopped charging. it repeatedly bumps against the dock but never begins charging. the battery is now dead and it doesnt work anymore.
POS 	Returned product , it was destroyed in shipment
POS 	I planted it in the ground and it just dried up and died.
POS 	Put meat directly on tray after 2 hours still frozen. I put chicken breast directly on tray. Waisted my money. Guess if I want fast de-frost I have to use microwave.
POS 	Didn’t receive my item said it got delivered , but I never recieved it .
POS 	The headset stopped working after six months.
POS 	I ordered two of these with the exact same descriptions and logos. One was twice the size of the other. Not okay for my purposes.
POS 	broke getting pulled on by a 20lb puppy.
POS 	Worked for a few hours then would stop working and you'd have to unplug it from the wall and plug it in again. Just for it to stop working 10 minutes later.
POS 	DO NOT BUY! These caps are WAY too small for anyone who has hair.
POS 	They’re very stiff and the clip falls off with one use
POS 	I ordered these for my beach wedding. It is supposed to come with a PAIR, meaning two, one for each foot. When it arrived it had only one of the two in the package. I tried contacting the seller 2 weeks ago and still have not gotten a response.
POS 	I only printed one piece of paper that had very minimal color and a few black and white pieces and now I'm more than half empty of the tri color ink. Bought January 3rd 2019 and now almost empty. I've spent more on ink than what I originally paid for the printer.
POS 	I'm giving this only one star mainly for how it was shipped! It was send in an amazon box that would've packaged all of it nicely, but instead was rolled up in another package & then put in the box! The hat has a crease right in the front that we can't get out, & leaves it looking more like Peter Pan's hat! If I had for time, I would've sent it back, but now I'm trying to use an iron to get that crease out.
POS 	did nothing, was not scented lemon in the least. not even lemon colored, mine were blue.
POS 	I have not received today is 16th - was supposed t be here 15th
POS 	My chipmunks are still here
POS 	Not what I ordered. Not Bormioli Rocco glasses. FIVE of the 12 glasses were broken.
POS 	It is not working at all. Terrible product!
POS 	I wear my fitbit every day. Normal wear, desk job, run, nothing out of the ordinary. The band is extremely dirty and can't be cleaned. I tried cleaning it with everything and it's really dirty looking after only a month of wearing it.
POS 	Simple to assemble; just didn’t work
POS 	I wear a size 7 an 8 in thongs they barley covered the front part of my panties a waste of money
POS 	I have not received this product even though it says it was delivered.
POS 	It’s didn’t fit at all like this picture. It was horrible
POS 	The colors were pretty however one clipboard came without the top clip being attached fully to the board. I needed them for a gift the next day and Had no time to return them and shop for new ones so I was stuck with the broken clipboard.
POS 	Didn't move much dust in the keyboard or even just on the desk.
POS 	I decided to try this for my GERD after reading all those great reviews. I took two gels on an empty stomach as directed about 30 minutes before breakfast. After a few hours I became nauseous; this was followed by terrible flatulence, then diarrhea, then finally by the worst acid reflux I've suffered in over a decade. I have to wonder if this is even the same product reviewed! GARBAGE. Wish I could give minus-four stars.
POS 	The battery died will not change
POS 	came with all kinds of wrinkles in the paper.
POS 	You sent me a scratched up used unit. I hope it works
POS 	I installed this product,at first I saw flickering lights on my screen once in a while. Eventually the entire screen turned white i hope I can get my money back for this. it's clearly not good
POS 	Only worked for two months every time I used it it got burning hot and smelled like melting plastic while only airing up about 10 psi now it stopped working yesterday
POS 	This is very uncomfortable and doesn’t support your back like it states. It digs into your armpits.
POS 	Too right around the neck. Really for teens.
POS 	I literally received these yesterday, used twice today and it already has milk in it.... So disappointing and a waste of money!!
POS 	Credit cards stick out too far, and there's little room for any extra membership/rewards cards. Magnet is weak; wouldn't trust it with more than a few singles. You really have to force the cards in for some of the slots. I was really hoping I could replace my beat up wallet with this, but it's nothing like I was hoping and I'll probably just toss it out and keep using my old wallet. If you have 4 cards and an ID, sure, it might be sufficient. But for the rest of us in the real world, this thing is a waste of money.
POS 	Just purchased in March and it has since died so only worked for 6 months
POS 	Don't buy this. I bought this 2 weeks ago and it's already not working. A complete waste of money
POS 	Very poor quality. Our six year old son received on X-mas morning, by lunchtime everything but the ice cubes had broken. Bought a better quality whoopie cushion at the dollar store.
POS 	1st time using this brand and definitely the last. Both tests came out invalid and were completely useless. Went and bought another well known brand and got results within seconds.
POS 	Did not work. The Ortho product is 100 times better
POS 	Just other reviewers mentioned, I got breakouts on my chin and forehead. Shea butter is one of its ingredients and this is not good for sensitive skin though it can be moisturizing for the body not for sensitive face.
POS 	Never recieved this item and it took over a month to get
POS 	Used only once and it is falling apart and already has a hole....
POS 	I ordered a case for an Iphone 6 and I got a 6s. I need a case for a 6
POS 	The chord either was defective or not compatible with our PC and monitor. There is little help provided from the manufacturer
POS 	Broke the first time my son turned it on.
POS 	Piece of garbage tightened it up to start stretching and the joint broke first turn. Wasn’t going crazy on it as soon as a little pressure got on the shoe it broke. Tried the second one and the same happened. Don’t waste your time or money.
POS 	Huge disappointment that caused nothing but grievances. This TV only lasted 21 days. This Lemon TV quit showing a display out of the blue the day before Christmas Eve! What timing! Guess what I did for Christmas? Not surprised this TV is discontinued. It's a glorified paperweight. Element should stick with making cardboard boxes. I never write reviews but this was a special case. I would avoid buying any Televisions through Amazon. Period. Avoid the hassle and get a name brand TV like a Sony or Samsung. The few extra bucks is worth the peace of mind. Today as I write this, UPS just tried to deliver the same TV I sent out to return for a refund. Didn't bother ringing the door bell with the return label on Tuesday. Welcome to the Holiday Season. Incompetence with both Amazon and UPS. Now I'm going to have to wait probably another week for my refund. If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Buy cheap, get cheap. Just buy a Sony. Don't buy a TV with less than a 4-Star rating and less than 200 reviews. Rule of thumb. P.S. Android is better. Happy New Year!
POS 	They sent me the wrong product. I tried to return or replace and the policy is no returns. There is no option to even contact the seller. Nordic Naturals better fix this
POS 	The string snapped on my tent after one use
POS 	I only had this collar for three months and it broke. Luckily, it happened in my backyard and not when I was walking my dog in the street. This collar is not durable or strong enough for a large dog. I have a golden lab crossbreed. I cannot rate it highly based on my experience.
POS 	Super flimsy. Not appropriate for a larger dog. My german shorthair pointer was able to get out multiple times, even with zip tying and using carabiners. Broke out once and ripped open his stomach area. Would not suggest for a larger dog. Only for a small dog to have a bigger kennel space.
POS 	These came in a huge box with other things that were glass!! The box was so big this poor little bottle just went from one place to the next in that huge box!! I’m surprised they weren’t broken all to pieces. Not to mention there was a gaping hole where the tape didn’t even catch !! I could stick my hand inside the box while it was taped!!
POS 	The product that was sent was the wrong item. I will try and reorder the right one.
POS 	Just no! This SPF runs into your eyes and makes them burn. There is a whitish cast to it as well. Hard pass on this.
POS 	Disappointed in this charger. Upon removing it from the package it did not fit snug into the charging port. Very loose fit and often is not charging my phone.
POS 	**update** My Janome hates this bobbin thread. :0( thought it was just my machine that hated this thread but I gave the thread to a friend who has a Brother machine. Her machine hated it too. This bobbin thread is cheap & constantly broke...super frustrating! do yourself a favor and don't buy this thread!
POS 	I ordered three separate orders from this seller, and NONE of my orders arrived. BUY ELSEWHERE.
POS 	The shoes are super cute. I love the design. However they are very poorly constructed with the cheapest materials that I have ever felt on a "shoe". Because of this they are VERY uncomfortable. I had to put memory foam insoles in them, bandaids on the inside of the back of them, which has made a difference. But there is still a section that is poking the top of my left foot. Not sure what to do about that. Overall, I love the look but the feel and construction are horrible. Won't be buying them again.
POS 	What to do will it work hope you can figure it out
POS 	It’s horrible. It takes ages to load even the most simple thing like settings, the touch screen won’t swipe. And the keyboard doesn’t type and the mouse doesn’t work. Horrible product would never recommend just save up for a real device.
POS 	It's warm, I like the design, but after a couple of washes the pocket stitching is falling apart. This is a VERY cheaply made product and lasts about a month before it starts falling apart.
POS 	The item overheated here and it has a very annoying noise. It's not worth it. Better to pay more for a original one. I've learned the lesson the worst way.
POS 	Zipper ripped off within the first week.
POS 	Doesn't stick well to paper. Doesn't hold fine detail.
POS 	Installed correctly on the REC head unit in my 06 Jeep Commander to emulate VES and it did nothing. I could not select VES. I tried disconnecting and connecting again. Still nothing. Returned for refund. Garbage.
POS 	Leaks like crazy if u don't use the quick disconnect , but does have the normal hose thread. Only found useful on 0 setting to foam , but uses soap in about 15 secs. I've used many products and always like to try new ways to wash my car, i take a lot of pride in my car and keeping it clean, and beautiful
POS 	Product didn't make it a year before it quit recharging.
POS 	This hair is not good at all very disappointed this hair is always nappy I always have to comb it gets very tangled . I will Never purchase this hair wast of money.
POS 	Horrible product it did not work did not heat properly! Do not buy from them I accidentally threw the box away can’t return just don’t want others to buy from them! Don’t make my mistake
POS 	TRUCK DID NOT WORK... NO LIGHTS, NO SIREN.....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WORKED ON CHRISTMAS DAY. NOT EVEN AFTER BUYING NEW BATTERIES.
POS 	The item was so thin and flimsy. Did not offer comfort to my dog in her crate. It did wash well but I would not recommend this product. Dog finally tore it apart and I threw it out.
POS 	Super annoying. Shipped late, cases not as described. Don't waste your time. Don't let the photo fool you! Awkward, poorly designed. Very poor quality. Spend a little more and get something better. I am very disappointed.
POS 	Bought two of these lights and they seemed to work when tested. I mean they turned on and responded to sound as was expected. During an event ( first use) these lights had problems and did not respond to the remote and the buttons in the back. Also could not get the lights to work with the DMX and could not be slaved. Fussed with the light trying everything possible but had no success. Very disappointed as I was very excited for these lights. Luckily we had bought and brought other par lights from other brands that we used with no issues.
POS 	One of these works fine, the other will not be recognized by my phone.
POS 	HATE IT! HOSE LEAKS AND I CANNOT GET A RESPONSE FROM SELLER.
POS 	Have used this brand before with no issues. This batch all the pods had grounds in the coffee. Tried another brand to ck the machine--no issue. Amazon did refund the cost with no hassle.
POS 	I was truly disappointed in the product, thought it would of held more ashes, and also broke a screw top when sealing it on one of them
POS 	This is the nicer of the two i received. Not what I expected. Doesnt look like pics. Very disappointed.
POS 	The phone seemed like it was a good buy for the first month or two, until one day it stopped charging. Nokia refused to offer a refund and required me to send the phone in for repair. A week later I got it back and it seemed to be fixed. A month later the charging port failed again. This phone is not worth the headache you will experience trying to get it fixed. Do yourself a favor and just but a Pixel 3a, it costs a little bit more, but you won't have to deal with Nokia which is a bonus.
POS 	Did not work consistently right out of the box!The durability of these lighting charge cords is pure shit
POS 	Did not work wast of time sending anything back
POS 	Highly upset about this purchase, just had the lights installed, had to pay for that of course.. already had a fixture blow on me. Highly upset
POS 	App did not work with the Amazon Fire 10 tablet.
POS 	This either doesn’t keep the rain out or else provoked immediate condensation. Either way, if it starts raining the inside of these glove covers will be immediately wet.
POS 	White streaks show up after a few minutes of use.
POS 	Item showed up with no filter. I put in a request for a replacement. Once I get this setup finally I will update
POS 	Sucks! Doesn’t even work! Waste of money!
POS 	Very flimsy material . No protection
POS 	They sent me a face mask instead of the chest mask, I haven’t returned it yet. this is the first time I’ve ever ordered from Amazon and gotten the wrong thing.
POS 	The fabric is bad and cheap
POS 	Really cheap product. Card holder near impossible to open.
POS 	Doesn't work on Amazon fire stick for any device. Not Google. Not iOS. Waste of money.
POS 	I got this lounger within a few days of ordering. It is what I expected, versatile and fits my small space. I have not had a guest sleep on it yet, but it feels fine to me and my son as far as lounging around. The price is amazing, it is a good deal. No complaints, it all works well. The cover material seems strong and the frame seems solid.
POS 	This rack arrived so twisted/bent that it can not be assembled. I wanted it for an upcoming trip but I will not have enough time to return it, wait for the new one to arrive before my trip. Absolutely useless junk with no QC. I will just return this item and go to a local business to get one. Thanks for wasting my time.
POS 	Didn't come on time as all my Amazon Prime orders do when they say they will.
POS 	First time washed, regular cycle and steam came apart with fraying and shredding!
POS 	This product was about 4-5 inches too short to fit in my 2015 Honda CRV. Disappointed. Will be returning.
POS 	As per headline. Recd Jan 3, installed a week later and one burned out when turned car on this AM (Jan 24). They are definitely brighter than stock but a little expensive and time consuming to be replacing one every two weeks.
POS 	It doesn’t work Just they take money ! sorry for amazon to sell like this items .
POS 	Arrived with small dent on the front by the switches, no marks on box. Fan is noisy in the low speed. Would not buy this one again.
POS 	For getting a deal on this case from amazon instead of paying 100$ for it at Best Buy is cool. Yes it is lifeproof and water resistant but if you’re someone that is very active and planning on using it as your daily case I don’t recommend it. Long story short I work on a farm used the case for a week and my camera is useless now because is scratched and makes my pictures blurry which is very annoying considering the case is supposed to be scratch resistant...... 🙃
POS 	The projector power outlet built into the projector does not work properly as it is very loose therefore the projector does not stay connected to the power cord. This means it does not stay on long enough to project anything. I would never buy from this vendor again. Horrible product do not purchase it. Should be 0 stars
POS 	If you're looking for a way out of your marriage, you've just found it. Your love won't survive assembling this hulking mistake. The instructions were hard to follow, especially with someone screaming their eternal rage the entire time. If you have hearing aids, I'd suggest turning them off before you start. But, once you're done it doesn't end there. You will find new fury and hatred both for yourself and your partner as you realise the drawers don't work, none of them are aligned, and they catch when trying to open and close them. I hope you lift weights because you're gonna have to strong arm this drawer open anytime you need anything. The hardest part about this whole ordeal is that you don't realize how awful it truly is until after you put it together, and they require you to disassemble it to send it back. We won't be sending it back because a divorce is more expensive than the dresser.
POS 	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM. THE BRIM OF THIS HAT IS NOTHING BUT CARDBOARD. WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY. AMAZON, MAY I PLEASE HAVE MY MONEY BACK?
POS 	Toke forever to get my eyeliner stamps, haven’t tried them yet.
POS 	These shoes were not comfortable. They felt unstable.
POS 	I was supposed to get a knife sheath and got a tablecloth. You gotta be kidding me.really
POS 	Its just bot full very bare and so not worth 25.00
POS 	The length was perfect but only worked well for about 2 weeks. A complete waste of money.
POS 	The flashlight was great for a week... that was all it worked, and it was not the batteries. Amazon gave me a credit and I have since order another brand so I will try it again.
POS 	Z-wave plugins are all too big. They block at least one more outlet in addition to the one they're plugged into. You can't plug two into a standard, 2 outlet box. This seemed like a great solution. Unfortunately, the unit didn't work properly. It shut off one of the outlets at arbitrary times (leaving me with cold coffee). Also, the user-interface is very poor. Having to hit the tiny little button multiple times to turn one outlet on vs. the other is hard to do correctly (4 times to turn one one). And, no one in the house could remember all the variations for turning each outlet on/off. They really need to add another button so there is one for each outlet. It is beyond 30 days since I ordered it, otherwise, I would return it.
POS 	The book I received is NOT NEW although it was sold as such. It's banged up all over the margins and it has a mark right in the center of the title.
POS 	I ordered to find that this looks absolutely nothing like the website description. The proportions are different the product is very flat versus the pictures provided and overall was very disappointing, unless you have a pretty small member it will not fit. Don't purchase this as it will be a waste of time and money. I am surprised this has a good rating.
POS 	This was never emailed to me still waiting since July 17th 2018
POS 	Works great at about 10 feet away phone. Any farther it can't find a signal, disconnects... basically useless.
POS 	Nothing like the picture. Very short
POS 	My advice? Simply do not by this drive. This is the 5th one...that's right...the 5th one that I've had to return under warranty. Each has failed suddenly leaving me without a secondary back-up drive. Do not buy this drive unless you want maximum unreliability, down time on your drive, the hassle of setting up an RMA, and a trip to the post office (you pay the return shipping)
POS 	Not sure if it was just mine, but my picture is not clear at all.
POS 	Did not work at all. Was a gift for a child.
POS 	I really hope the company reads this and fixes the issue at hand. I recently purchased a brand new textbook and the binding isn’t even attached. I would 100% have rather gotten a used scribbled in book since now this book will be helpless dragging to and from class. The book literally came out of a plastic wrap like this and I have no idea how this could happen.
POS 	Ripped in the wind, lasted one windy day only
POS 	This is not for windows it’s definitely a shower curtain
POS 	Dont buy this crap .. Only came with 1 ear piece && it was hugh i don't think no human ear could fit this please dont buy
POS 	Loses packages on the road. Sucks
POS 	Do not waste your time or money on these. Have tried using them to seal dry food products used 3 bags and not one of them stayed sealed, all we reinflated within 5 minutes. Will be purchasing a proper vacuum sealer and never use these again.
POS 	Died after 6 months. Waste of money.
POS 	I’ve had this before and tasted great. However this batch tasted spoiled. Can’t return! Very frustrating
POS 	Would not stick, opened package followed instructions and won’t stick
POS 	The mask is not black. It is white. I assumed I was received the color I received and 5 additional ones for the cost. Others are much cheaper for the one listed. I’m waiting on a response from the seller and will update when I get it.
POS 	not bright enough. we tossed in trash.
POS 	Bought 2; they both died two after opening them. Tried to recharge batteries but screws in the units are so small that no screw driver could loosen them. not worth the effort to even return them.
POS 	An entire piece was missing from the split and taped carton but we were too far along to repack it and send it back. Pieces didn't fit together well so we had to make adjustments. Poorly designed.
POS 	Has a chemical smell reminiscent of hospital antiseptic. Doesn't go very far- lots of pumps for a body wash. Wish I could sent it back. Definitely won't purchase again.
POS 	Been buying stuff online for longer then I can remember and this probably is the worst item I have ever gotten. No instructions included and horrible quality. You can get better at IKEA and that's pretty bad.
POS 	So during 2nd Rifle season, up in the Colorado mountains, on Day 6 of the hunt.. mother nature decided to gift us with ~8 inches of snow. Finally, I had the opportunity to try out my Frogg Togg's and pull them out of my ruck. For the first couple hours, standing up right and walking through the snow looking for elk tracks, they worked great. They kept my legs dry and provided an extra layer of insulation. Despite it being around 13 degrees, my legs and torso were fine and I actually overhearing if anything after about an hour of walking in the snow. Then, we get back to the camp site.... We decided to throw on the snow chains to the truck in case we got can animal and needed mobility to move it. I took my first knee in my brand new, first time ever worn Frogg Togg bottoms... and the crotch blew out. Talk about disappointment. Maybe I received a defective product? Manufacturer/Amazon seller, please let me know if this is true. Or, is taking a knee while wearing these just out if the question? I was wearing 1 layer of thin poly pro's, one pair of super thin athletic pants (ADIDAS), a pair of Carhart hunting pants bottoms, and then XXL Frogg Togg bottoms when this happened. I felt like I was swimming in my clothing and was not expecting the crotch to pop. I mean, I could understand if I was wearing a Large, maybe even a XL, but come on..it was a 2XL. Am I supposed to be rocking 3 or 4X in order to be able to perform a simple function such as taking a knee? In closing.. thankfully the top I have is in good shape and no issues so far. Buyers beware. At least for the pants... which is what you need most! if I wanted to only protect my top, I would have went with my poncho.
POS 	Worked great for a month. As soon as the return window closed I started getting “This accessory may not be supported” with my iphoneX. Still seems to be working fine with my old iPad mini though. Bummer.
POS 	Not a single good candle in the box, they were all bent.
POS 	So disappointed in this product. It was not as pictured. The picture shows a more square bag. The one I received was more slouchy. I purchased it to use for work for a laptop. Theres no way it would fit. I ended up donating this bag.
POS 	Hard to seal. When I finally got them sealed they did not stay sealed.
POS 	Light stops working in a few days 😡
POS 	The decanter I received is not what is advertised. I received a cheap knock off made from thin glass weighing in at only 8oz compared to the 2lb. Decanter advertised, as well as a smooth bottom instead of a crimped to protect the bottom.
POS 	This router also suffers from the "Netgear Upload bug". I'm not paying to go through this BS again. For anyone who gets this bug, the fix involves several factory resets in a row - or if you are feeling lucky: 1 factory reset and several router power cycles until you see your upload speed go above 0.2 mbps. A google search shows that this issue has been around since at least 2015. Otherwise, this router looks like it would have been good on paper. Returning to Amazon.
POS 	This guage MUST be installed with the relief port facing up, yet 99% of hose spigots point down. It is unusable in this manner.
POS 	Item was missing. Had to request a refund.
POS 	The product is good however the company sent me two right wrist wraps. Which makes it very difficult to put on. My friend had ordered this product and didn't have any problems. I am unhappy with this.
POS 	I plug the DVD-RW external drive into my laptop and hear it whirl but I can't find it "anywhere" on my desktop. Tried a restart, made sure that the external drive was seen in "preferences' and still nothing, I can't even find a website for support. Total waste of money so don't waste yours on this product.
POS 	Terrible smell for two weeks of airing out. Awful support after using for only about three weeks. Into the garbage. Kept the pillow cases which are terrific.
POS 	Didn’t find these brushes useful.
POS 	I love the scent and everything, but I probably won't buy it from this store again. It leaked in the packaging and was literally everywhere. Almost a 1/8 of it was gone because no one at their store bothered to make sure the lid was on all the way.
POS 	I was not sent what I ordered. What I recieved SUCKS. it's not organic it smells horrible and the chemicals made me nauseous
POS 	case was scratched when I got it
POS 	Couldn't select zero stars. When the light comes on, the power to the bulb is reduced dramatically. The bulb will be so dim that you might as well go back to fumbling for your keys in the dark! I bought 2 and both did the same thing. Very disappointed with Intermatic brand. I've used their products before and the quality was always great. Cheap imported junk.
POS 	When I placed the order, the website listing said 6 packs of 25. I received 3 packs of 25. When I clicked back on the order link it showed 3 packs of 25 as what I was buying. I would never pay that price for 3 packs of 25. All of the reviews indicate 150 wipes was the product ordered. Other purchasers indicate they had the same problem. Amazon did make it right.
POS 	This tastes like liquid splenda. The aftertaste is horrible. Now I’m stuck with two bottles of syrup that I don’t want to throw away because they cost money and I know will stay in the shelve until I give up. Bought it after a FB page continued to rave about it but obviously she’s getting paid because I don’t know how else you can recommend this product. Monk fruit is not a tasty sugar substitute.
POS 	Don't waste your money. Cheap cheap cheap!
POS 	The product was not worth purchasing. I had to reglue the cupcake stars onto the sticks.
POS 	The were coming apart so could not use
POS 	I’ve used this product on several different animals for about a month and I haven’t noticed any improvements on the hot spots. This product doesn’t work, don’t waste your money on over priced oils.
POS 	Seriously????? The A it’s wrong!!!!
POS 	Item was ripped, damaged, flower was ripped out of dress, it even had a hole, to make it worse it had stains on the dress and was way to long for a 3 year old, and shipped at wrong address, will be returning the item soon.
POS 	Two of the cords stopped working. This was possibly due to substandard materials
POS 	This is the worst filter I have ever had. There was a foul strong plastic taste to the water. My unfiltered tap water tastes much better. Tested the water from the filter and the TDS level is much higher then the tap water. A complete waste of money. Will stick with a reputable filter company in the future.
POS 	Every time I placed my order item were delivered broken
POS 	Lasted one day, doesnt stay connected. Tried to balance it to charge ..nothing worked....
POS 	Chose wrong thing. Was trying to download the real Hulu!
POS 	Very low quality, looking at the pictures I was expecting better. It’s very thin and image is badly printed.
POS 	The antenna reception was sadly lower than I expected & does not work.
POS 	I washed these one time and this is what they look like. It is clearly fabric defect and the threads are pulling loose. I have contacted the company 3x via written communication and no response. I left a voice mail and no response. And THEY DO NO ANSWER PHONES OR E-MAILS. There's ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. I should have known it was too good to be true. Money wasted.
POS 	My dog normally devours any bully stick in minutes, he loves them. He would not touch these. Smelled them and literally walked away. Not sure why but we did notice these had a crimson red color which we have never seen with other bully sticks.
POS 	I bought this because I read all the positive reviews. It had the opposite effect for me. I bought it to generally use as a hand lotion to soften and moisturize my hands. It has done the complete opposite. It has dried out my hands and left them looking scaly - literally! This was after about a week of using it. It has also left my hands so dry that I am snagging my clothing when I have to put clothes on or adjust them, especially nylons. I am sending it back. I'll go back to my previous hand lotion, which never left them dry. I just tried this because it supposedly had healthier ingredients and didn't leave a greasy residue.
POS 	Unfortunately it was not as sturdy as we would have liked. Will be sending this back.
POS 	This is a bright light, Seems to be good quality, but I just took it on its second dive and it flooded out destroying the light and one of my batteries. Looks like all of the seals were in tact so it must be the switch?
POS 	I got these and I was SO excited to get them on my Jeep. After install, with NO CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS, and it took all day, we finally got to turn the lights on. That is where the problem began. The halo white lights work. The remote, and the color changes along with the App they tell you to install, none of this turned on the colors of the Halo lights. The only reason I wanted these was so have clear and color choices. Now I am stuck with the lights on my jeep with no color. Then, they also put in a piece of paper telling you that after you install this, a relay item that you can use for the colors might be defected and will have to be sent back to them for the company see "IF" it is defected. I am SO SO SO disappointed with the product. If you want these lights, I suggest you find another manufacture then these guys. Waste of time and money. I will post a picture later of the paper that I am talking about that came in the box.
POS 	Came all damage!! Need more care when they sent it !!!!
POS 	What I liked was the price and qhat I disliked was it was not durable. I don't know if it was the charger or the wire but it doesn't work.
POS 	The spiral wire binding does not hold the pages securely. There is a significant gap in the wire binding, and with minimal use of the planner, the pages started falling off the spiral entirely. Like the design, layout and tabs, but it's useless as it doesn't hold together.
POS 	The middle of the paddle is higher than the outside as soon as it is a bit wet I slide all over the pedal. These are not usable for mountain biking.
POS 	I didnot receive the item, so I emailed the seller to inquire the status. However, after sending couple emails to the seller, I didnot get any response from the seller.
POS 	I ordered two of these, they look solid and I was hopeful they would hold up. Both broke within just a couple of weeks use. Disappointing and a waste of time and money.
POS 	This pan performed well the first 3 times used maybe, then everything sticks, not a non-stick pan at all.
POS 	Doesn't fit on all desk types
POS 	You can't even pick up these balls without crushing them.
POS 	terrible taste to hard will not be buying this no more do not recommend
POS 	Just purchased an Apple Watch series 5 and I wanted to protect the screen face, these screen protector fit the face however the interaction/feel with the watch is often unresponsive making the experience a big disappointment - I will not be using these screen protectors.
POS 	No change. Maybe it’s just my skin type
POS 	I like mixer but beater broke 3rd time I used it. I was making frosting so was soft ingredients. Appears rusty, weak solder joint . Contacted Aicok and they said they didn't sell accessories but would send out returned mixer that had good beaters. That was 2 months ago and now the seem to be backing out of doing anything. Save your money. Beaters are defective.
POS 	Worst experience ever on amazon I bought a table, balls and an extra set of players , but days later they said they don’t ship to California ...... but just the table won’t be shipped, you’ll be stuck with the rest, and you will be charged when trying to return Costumer service is rude and very poor
POS 	Update: the dress is still missing eyelets after my second order. I am returning it again and I hope third time is a charm. My daughter is dancing the waltz in her friend’s quinceanera and they are wearing this dress. However, it is missing eyelets so I have to return it and I hope the next one has eyelets. This is so frustrating!
POS 	Product received quickly and packaged well. However, no 6 foot cord with dimmer switch was included in the box. Would love to be enjoying all the benefits of my new lamp but that’s impossible without the main part to make it a lamp. Very frustrated!
POS 	Never received the item I ordered
POS 	These orange juice (small bottles) tasted as if the dates were expired long back...they do not taste even 10% close to the fresh one you buy in grocery store....stay away.
POS 	This was my second one in about 6 months, the first one broke (the plastic that allows the clock face to snap in, split apart). I re-ordered in hopes it was a fluke but the second one broke in the same way after only 3 weeks.
POS 	It wasn't the same size as pictured. They are not sticking to wall they started falling off the next day. Dont buy!
POS 	Bought it to go to Mexico so I could go in water. Wore it for 10days in pool and straps turn all yellow. So now the watch is white but the straps are all yellow. ugly
POS 	Do not buy from this seller. The card did not work.
POS 	This was received with a big crack in the glass. It is a bit crazy to send back the broken glass
POS 	Installed an about 2 days later it started spraying water out of the tank...Bag had a hole in it... Not worth the trouble of time an cost to send back....Will buy another product elsewhere...
POS 	Totally sent the wrong size. Ugh!! Ordered XS was sent a large. In a time crunch
POS 	This is happening too many times, receiving the wrong item. I received the wrong book before and now I received the wrong puzzle. I kept the puzzle because I did not have it. Again I am very disappointed with Amazon.
POS 	Was sold on this item when advertised with a 50 recipe book. Came with nothing, not even a link for download. Needless to say I'm disappointed.
POS 	This is terrible. Keeps falling apart. You can get better from the dollar store.
POS 	I love the product but it's too small and collapses on its own
POS 	I received this chair today and definitely regret buying it. The off gasses made me and my son both sick with difficulty breathing and sore throats. There was no odor however some chemicals do not have a smell. There is formaldehyde per the package insert. Wish I had known this before buying. The reviews seemed to convince me that it was also pretty comfy but sadly I would not want to sit in this chair for More than a few minutes. It’s very firm and not the chair I was hoping for. It’s currently outside off gassing and will most likely keep it because I’m too lazy to pack it back up. It will probably grace the corner in spare room to torment any guests we have in the future.
POS 	Useless. It continually gets punctures along the seem which are very difficult to patch. I'm 4 patches in at this stage and have given up. Overall I think I got about 30mins use out of this thing before the punctures started. Then I spent about 3 hrs identifying & fixing various punctures. What a waste of $50.
POS 	It never arrived I'm still waiting after 5 months
POS 	worked for a couple of weeks terrible product
POS 	Love the product. Hate ordering it from Amazon. At least twice, Amazon has cancelled my order on the day it was scheduled to arrive. Why sell it if you can’t safely deliver a liquid formula?
POS 	Received 3 hardback and 3 paperback
POS 	Its to small can even fit enough wipes
POS 	In my opinion the magnet on this band is extremely weak. It constantly slides and loosens all day long. If the magnet held I would have given 5 stars. It’s very comfortable, I’m just annoyed that I have to tighten the strap back up every 15 minutes or so
POS 	This LED lights did not stick to my walls. I set them up in my room (efficiently, I made sure they shouldnt fall off) and left for a couple hours. When I came back they had completely fallen off. I messaged them to see if I could get my money back or if another one could be sent to me because I thought maybe the one I received was defective and they never even responded and its been 2 weeks.
POS 	I got a 3X and they are ridiculously small. More like a medium. Don't waste your money.
POS 	Heats very unevenly on our glass-top stove. Had a horrible time trying to cook pancakes, some were under-done, some burned. It's smaller than I expected -- it really only fits three or four pancakes at once (my old electric griddle easily fit six). I also don't like the extra maintenance requirements (wiping it down with oil after every wash). I do not recommend this griddle.
POS 	Made me feel like I was being manipulated through propaganda. I hate that. No thank you.
POS 	Didn’t last 3 months and doesn’t work !! Disappointed would not recommend buying this at all!!
POS 	These locks are easy to program and seemed like they would work great. However, after a week one of the locks stopped working. It won’t close at all. This is very inconvenient because I shared the package with a friend so I only have one lock which no longer works.
POS 	Good thermal qualities but the material is too stiff. They don’t hang well at all. Very disappointed but will serve there purpose for the rest of the Michigan winter.
POS 	Garbage! Fell off on the first ride once I got into the freeway. Luckily noone was killed by this flying price if debris
POS 	The connection on the left headphone doesn’t work.
POS 	Lasted for about 2 months, now most of them are not working or will work sparingly. Also the charging port connector was easily bender and damaged .
POS 	This thing is a piece of crap! It stopped working within a couple of weeks :-(
POS 	Looks nothing like the picture. Did not cover the entire Juul. The cutout for the LED was on the sides so when you wrapped it, there was a line down the middle of the Juul in the front. Poorly designed and would not recommend buying.
POS 	Starting braking within 1 month
POS 	This is advertised as bait......it's not...........it will kill them if they walk through it so I dusted it under my appliances, but the lure part.........nada
POS 	I’ve been taking this product for a week now. I’ve been staying faithful on exercising and low carb. I haven’t lost one pound. Frustrated
POS 	Not very thick. Wasn't what I was expecting. Returned
POS 	This product looks good at face value but didn’t last me 6 months. I think I need to have a refund.
POS 	I never even received the candles. Poor service. The rating is zero.
POS 	I don’t know how this pad works —it kept my sheets cool but made me extremely hot during the night. By blocking all my body heat my memory foam mattress felt like sleeping on a rock.
POS 	I received this today and am new to the product. I ignored the negative reviews thinking it had so many good reviews. I do not know what the consistency is supposed to be like but I know I do not like this. It is like pouring water out of a container. There is no thickness to the product and is like the bubble mixture you make for kids to blow bubbles with dish soap. I ordered two scents. Diva smelled fine. High Maintenance smelled like bug spray. I did a load of laundry and spilled way too much detergent into the wash because of consistency. I say this because there was no smell on the clothes when removing them from the washing machine. I would spend way too much money on something that smells good and lasts. That brand promise is exciting. I do not know if this is how it is supposed to be or if in fact this is not the real product. I cannot imagine wanting to purchase this product based on this. Maybe someone can tell me if this is how it is supposed to be and if so, how do I have any success with the product? Thanks!
POS 	it was cute but when i tried making it shorter with the tools that were provided the little tool to take out the band got stuck in one of the links and one of the little pins from the link got stuck when i tried taking them out to make it shorter it was cute but what a waste of money
POS 	This was a birthday gift and it came broken in pieces! I felt so bad about it I didn’t tell my daughter! Otherwise I think it would hav been a very cute mug!
POS 	Sound and lights come on but he doesn’t pop out to take the coin. Bummer.
POS 	I thought I will use for water so that i don’t have to use too many plastic bottles but it failed. It leaks all the time no matter how we set up. Don’t buy!! Not worth with price u pay.
POS 	Used it to keep my outdoor plants watered while we were gone. Stated they would keep your plants watered for up to two weeks. We were gone 4 days and one plant was dead, & the water was gone from the bulbs. Would not recommend.
POS 	The basket is fine, but ridiculously overpriced. You can buy the exact same thing at Target for $5.99. I did not realize this until it was too late and they were going to charge me almost $10 per box to mail them back so I am kind of stuck.
POS 	I've been trying to install this product for 5 days and all web site taking me over the place with not resolve
POS 	These nozzles are absolute JUNK. It took almost the whole package to find 12 that work. 8 didn't fit, 6 had the center orifice blow out the minute I turned the system on. I have requested a full refund from Amazon. If you have a high pressure system DO NOT BUY these!!!
POS 	Was excited to receive this product today. Unfortunately it's broken. The bottom part of the case is cracked.
POS 	the instant pot mini pot holders are worthless. You can actually feel the heat wearing them almost burning your fingers. I have an instant pot and i was surprised mitts wer such poor quality
POS 	don't get me wrong the product is great but when I went to the local walmart it was a least half less$ if not more.
POS 	Incorrect sizing -made for Chinese. Much too heavy for a holiday suitcase. Hard to get on anyway even if the size was right. Had to return and postage cost me nearly as much as the refunded price. Beware buyin goods from abroad.
POS 	Wow what a rip off! $30 for ten strips!? I thought it was ten boxes. Complete misrepresentation. By at cvs instead for $5. Do not buy!
POS 	Would not recommend. Poorly made. When we went to set up and plug in the lights one of the candy canes did not light up at all.
POS 	Unfortunately, this broke after about two months. I have also noticed some of the rhinestones are starting to discolor. I really liked it for a while, but disappointed in the durability.
POS 	I received broken and sent a message to seller and no response it’s been one month won’t buy from carrier again.
POS 	Less than 60 days into use it’s completely broke.... won’t turn on, won’t deflate etc.
POS 	Very light weight and thin... POOR quality seems like a product that costs 50 cents to make. Issued a return and they didn’t even want me to ship it back so I gave it away.
POS 	Very cheap, no instructions. What is the point to these?
POS 	This is the second unit I tried and both failed to charge. The first never took a charge and I returned it and decided that I must have got a bad unit and tried again. Don't waste your money on any these as they are all pretty much the same thing with a different sticker. All cheap junk.
POS 	Lunch box arrived today with a jagged, very sharp broken zipper pull. Would have cut a child most certainly. When I held the pull to take the photo the pull fell right off. Otherwise the lunch box looked great.
POS 	Did not use I ended up sending them back because they were the wrong size.
POS 	Can I give this zero stars? This product made my windshield worse! I tried it both wet and dry and neither worked. It just smeared the dirt on the windshield and left a cloudy film that when driving at night, I could barely see. Then, after a couple wipes, the handle started to crack. It's made of real cheap plastic. I am returning. Unfortunate cause I have a severely slanted windshield and I can't reach the bottom.
POS 	Killed my hair. I’m Asian, with normal thickness hair, straight, dyed hair. Avoid like the plague if you know what’s good for you.
POS 	was sent a steely dan CD.
POS 	Not worth buying terrible product
POS 	This pan worked great ... for four months. We followed care instructions perfectly, always washed it by hand and never with a rough sponge. However, already, any and all food sticks to the bottom and creates a mess every time we cook with it. So disappointed with this purchase and cannot recommend to anyone.
POS 	Doesn't work in a Manhattan apartment, unfortunately there is too much interference. Item returned to Amazon without problem.
POS 	It’s too big for the Radio Flyer swing which I bought it for. This is more for the industrial type swings you see in the parks.
POS 	Slowly drops down until it hits my keyboard. Tiny screw and Allen wrench to adjust the weight balance is a joke. Everything seems sturdy and well made except the most import part, the hinge. Like the other reviewer said I'm going to jam paper in the hinge to keep it from slowly sinking. Save your money, buy another brand.
POS 	Did not play on either of my machines. Players could not read it. Very odd. Have never had that happen with any other movies.
POS 	It is not consistent at all. I have a Samsung S10 and it seems to charge for a few minutes and then the indicator light starts to blink. Then it changes for a minute or two and it does the same thing. It never really changes the phone properly. I'm glad I have a different one now.
POS 	I had a CHEAP Harbor Freight tire kit I have been using for 10 years, I bought this one because it looked like a better quality. MY MISTAKE! Tire plug tool snapped in two first time I tried to plug a tire. I finished the job with my cheap HF kit. This is going in the trash.
POS 	One didnt even work, just get some CT Sounds speakers, theyre cheaper and actually work
POS 	The worst purchase I think I've ever made in a sock
POS 	Smells bad. Doesn’t work at all.
POS 	It came with no instructions! How do i find them?
POS 	Box was empty. Well, the shipping box contained a case for the lenses, but the case was empty. So I apparently purchased a very expensive glasses case. Very disappointing.
POS 	Poorly written. Too many side stories that didn’t add to the storyline.
POS 	Returned the rugs they were too thin, not good for a bathroom.
POS 	Description: "leather cover", not leather. What a waste. Why publish an in accurate product description?
POS 	Ordered on the 11th of July and here it is the 24th and still no order has arrived
POS 	These are cute, but many of the tips of the pinwheels were bent, and NINE of the sticks were missing. I don't have time to return these and reorder so my event is just going to be short nine pinwheels.
POS 	I’ve had this container 2 days. The lid has been on tight and the ants still got in. I’m very upset. I threw out the box and now I’m not sure how to return it. No seller to contact to work anything out. I’m very unsatisfied with this product.
POS 	The sticky back tape failed to stick to painted sheet rock. Holder falls off the wall everyday. Even removed the dust cover to reduce the weight. Still fell off. Ended up drilling a couple of holes in the holder so I could mount the product to the wall with screws. Wouldn't buy another product that mounts with only tape.
POS 	The coloring came off all of the tongue rings! I have had my tongue pierced for about 15 years; with these tongue rings I chipped two teeth one very badly do not buy!!!
POS 	Have read the reviews for a small pair of binoculars and thought these would be worth it. Decent for the size but very cheap plastic design that came scratched and rubber eye pieces bent and wet (weird I know). Looking for somewhere else to buy binoculars.
POS 	Ordered beginning of June didn't receive until August 22. When it did arrive it was clumpy 😠😠
POS 	This sharpener worked for a while, but stopped working. It tries to sharpen pencils, but it wont sharpen them anymore.
POS 	Way too big for 13" MacBook--the product description states it is for 13" and very clearly is not--there's an inch and a half of extra space of both length and width. I recommend avoiding this product as its product description is not accurate.
POS 	Two of the six bulbs came broken. I have used the other four bulbs up in six months. They work fine, but don’t last long. Very disappointed.
POS 	Worked for 1 out of 4 ball joints. The clamp bent and was very difficult to hold all the parts in the correct sequence to instal the others.
POS 	Bag has a hole in it from delivery. Flax seeds are in the delivery box not the flax seed bag
POS 	Cheap material. I ended up donating! The product did not arrived on time. Disappointed as it was for my daughters graduation.
POS 	I never recieved the order...I looked up my order derails and it said it was hand deliverd to customer...it wasn't me. Someone out there has my order!
POS 	This description says it has a drop down cup holder. It does not. The sofa is very nice but I wanted the cup holders so I didn't have to get end tables.
POS 	(Husbands account) I like my maxi dresses to touch the floor and this dress was above my ankles. I returned the dress and got refunded in the same day so that was great!
POS 	I never received my order.
POS 	I have not been able to access white noise premium on Alexa at all.
POS 	Doesnt work :( me and my 2004 mazda 3 were very disappointed
POS 	Don't waste your money. This thing is wildly inaccurate, even after following their poorly written instructions to calibrate it I could never get a consistent reading. Not even their own buffering powder could get the same reading twice
POS 	This products SUCKS. I tried 4 patches in a row and it did not work at all. This product should not even be on amazon. What a waste of $20. And it is very uncomfortable when you put it on.
POS 	this stuff is a wast of money it doesn't do any thing and it has a weird smell don't waist your money
POS 	Very cheap, it breaks easily... the material is cheap
POS 	I don’t know if it’s just me but I can’t get past the taste, I’m not sure if the canister was a bad batch because the taste was unbearable. I wanted to try this and was actually excited.
POS 	Bought for airsoft doesnt work even with have the loaded amount in their.. spring action is weak for 20$
POS 	I have used the black precut tape & it works fantastic. This red tape isn't very good & will not stick to my fingers while bowling.
POS 	Tastes bad, quit spraying immediately after two uses. No way to refund of return. Buyer beware and avoid!!!
POS 	In the bottle, several of the capsules had come apart and the content distributed across the remainder. I realized this the hard way. As I placed a capsule in my mouth, and prior to swallowing, I breathed inward. Thus, I sucked cinnamon and cayenne dust into my lungs. I thought I was going to die. Coughing, burning lungs, eyes watering, etc for about a half hour. I have no idea whether the product is otherwise any good, as I tossed the remainder into the trash.
POS 	It was used when I received it though I most definitely clicked on the new option.The colors look nice but I can't bring myself to touch the pallets. The dark blue color was emptied to the edges as if it had been used though there was a sticker on the opening as if it were a new product. It is otherwise as pictured and was delivered on time.
POS 	Not at all what I expected poor choices on receipes
POS 	THE PRODUCT SENDING THE "SELLER" IS DIFFERENT AND OF MUCH LOWER VALUE THAN THE ONE PUBLISHED.
POS 	Didn’t last long about a month?ALL Zippers broke within days and dark stains on the outside out of know where not very good quality at all
POS 	Arrived broken. Received an email about quality assurance asking to email them back if any issues were found. Emailed them. Never heard back.
POS 	Received the wrong size 4 times!! Customer service only refunds and asks you to reorder. Ridiculous. If I could leave less than 1 star I would.
POS 	Received an open and used one..... i ordered and was charged for a new one. $60 is way too much for this item used.
POS 	no instructions enclosed, very hard to figure out. Took longer than 15 minutes.
POS 	Thought it would be a good thing to try for adhd child. Did not see any change.
POS 	These batteries have the incorrect circuitry to charge with Milwaukee chargers. The batteries themselves may be fine, but good luck charging on a Milwaukee brand charger. Since day 1, I have to insert the battery roughly 20 times in and out of the charger before they start charging. If anyone knows of an aftermarket charger or a way to rewire the Milwaukee charger, I’d love to hear about it. Currently looking for dead Milwaukee batteries to pull the circuitry and maybe fix these.
POS 	unbreathable item, I though it is because of the size; so I decided to replace the item but the issue as a customer you must pay for the refound shipping which cost around 4 dollars and the item itself 9 dollar .. doesn't make any sense !!!!
POS 	The straws came in broken , how I suppose to give my child dirty straws. I was not happy with delivery.
POS 	Absolute junk. They fell apart the first time I wore them. I had been in the pool for 3 or 4 minutes when they started to split at the seam.
POS 	These are so cheaply made that just opening the clasp can break it.
POS 	I bought these to drive away gophers, they have been in the ground 2 months now and I still have active gophers all around these spikes, one of these spikes shuts off and I have to turn it off and back on each day for it to work the other three work fine making noise just not working for gophers.
POS 	Never received this item.
POS 	Used it for a very short while and phone froze! Its DEAD! Seller is not very helpful... JUNK!!!
POS 	This is not your normal Lil mover diapers I had the same thing happen to my son as some of the other reviewers. Shortly after starting to use these my son broke out in a horrible rash we have used this diaper before from else where with no issue and even from amazon. Also if your not extremely careful in how you place the diaper the band will cut your child's leg/hip area. Very displeased in these would not recommend buying these. I'm thinking maybe some of these are not really Huggies thrown in with real ones because of the reviews and my own experience. It seems like maybe one in 20 or so is a knock off and if you get them it's horrible I don't plan to risk it again. Furthermore for my son to break out in such a way it worries me of what these diapers contain I hope they don't have some harmful chemical on them. My son does not have sensitive skin and has never broke out like this before
POS 	This is flimsy and not as strong as the other ones. I do not recommend this.
POS 	These are either total GARBAGE or I have some very smart Wasp and Hornets. I've watch at least 7 go in....and get out whenever they want. Has yet to trap ONE "forever".
POS 	I successfully installed this initially, but tried to place it on an SSD from a regular platter and found the license key is not recognised by MicroSoft.
POS 	Received broken and missing parts
POS 	I have been waiting for a very long time. My order was never received even though the records show it as delivered. I was here all day, that includes the time of 'delivery'. The package was never delivered.
POS 	Install was easy and fits perfectly but it so unbalanced that the vibration makes it impossible to mow. Spend some extra and get the original OEM parts.
POS 	Ripped paint off the wall. Had no idea this could happen. Put plenty on to more than hold the picture per instructions. Came in the next day to find picture hanging by one hook and other hook and paint torn off the wall.
POS 	Ordered two cartridges, one has a faulty circuit which looks melted while the other arrived with the ink leaking staining me and my desk while opening the package.
POS 	Junk. Absolute garbage. They fell apart almost immediately. They don't fit or conform to your face at all. Very uncomfortable.
POS 	Only 2 bulbs work, 2 bulbs just don't turn on and one twitches, just AWFUL, and it's not a soft white either, it's a daylight color.
POS 	Recieved this battery as pictured. Contacted seller but will not reply.
POS 	Center part started detaching from the edge part the first time we used it. By the second use, it was completely falling apart, and we threw it away. Complete junk.
POS 	Worked great. Once. Then stopped working. Major waste of money and I’m irritated because it was a gift. Don’t bother.
POS 	Customer service was great when i had a concern about the product
POS 	Its cheap made. Looks like the ones you can buy at wish. And they are way cheaper on wish.
POS 	Suit is starting to fade after a few wears. After the 10th wear the suit is almost bleached out. I liked that is was fully lined but now the suit looks terrible.
POS 	It's NOT waterproof and will start to ruin the moment you use your watch in the water. If you plan on swimming or bathing with your watch one, I do not recommend this protector. Find one of those glass tempered ones
POS 	I have purchased 4 of these, the claim to work for hot liquids however 3 of them cracked on the first use and fell apart. The plastic does not withstand drinkable coffee temps.. I’m not a huge hot freak, but these did not last.
POS 	Put the screen protector on after cleaning the screen with the included materials. Felt like it was clicking against the screen and fell off the screen after 2 hours, cracking on the ground. Don't waste money on this protector.
POS 	Garbage.. not worth putting on my truck whatsoever..
POS 	they came in an amazon package, when I opened it, the candles came out and 2 were broken, the bag they came in, was even ripped.. not cool
POS 	Thought we had found a great replacement. About halfway through 2 of colors exploded and ruined my printer.
POS 	this was very disappointing as I do like your other ingredients and I also like the different flavors. This was absolutely horrible, there is no taste at all. I will never order this again and recommend the same that others should do.
POS 	False advertising!!!! I didn’t think to read the oz. considering the picture! Very deceptive
POS 	Bought these about two months ago and none of them work now. Occasionally the cord works for one second then stops, then you have to unplug the cord or try reinserting just for it to stop working again. Complete waste of money.
POS 	Great product But when I received my package my conditioner was spilled in the package I’m very dissatisfied
POS 	I am clearly the exception (it would seem) but here under shirts --- that are sweat proof -- seemed to increase my core temperature by 20-30 degrees. Ok - I am exaggerating but I was traveling by car and pulled over to take my shirt and tie off and rid myself of the undershirt so that I could cool down before my meeting. How? How does this work for others but makes me hot & sweaty. I bought two shirts and two underpants - I will say that the underpants seem better but truthfully I think the shirt experience sullied the whole deal.
POS 	I did not like the fact that it doesn't resemble the feel of a real guitar. I thought I was going to be to be able to practice playing on the go, but this was not the case. If you're looking for a practice tool to help you learn where to put your fingers I guess this would work. If you're looking for anything more than that this is not what you're looking for
POS 	I got these not even a week ago and the fur inside of the slipper is already detaching from the slipper. Very disappointed.
POS 	Ordered two of them. Almost $30 each one of them. Both of them not healthy looking. Will never purchase from this seller
POS 	It seemed like a bad idea, but I bought it to try with my trusty Bosch router. It was a bad idea. The cone wobbles off center so it can not be trusted as a centering pin.
POS 	The product never arrived.
POS 	The salt lick may be very good for the animals. But it lasts as long as it is not rained on. One or two good storms it melts away to nothing. Not worth the price to only be available for a couple of weeks. Use the larger mineral blocks. They tend to last an entire season.
POS 	Product came already open and falling out.
POS 	It’s shaped like a triangle, nothing close to this picture
POS 	Shattered in transit.
POS 	First off they don’t give enough washers to assemble properly. It’s difficult to assemble. Once assembled the feeder bar plugs very easily with fertilizer even with dry fertilizer but has slightly soft pellets. The material I was using has a black pellet that plugged the feeder bar. The 3 bags gone. $150 bucks. Most fertilizers now have soft pellets. This thing plugs them in the feeder bar and it turns into a solid bar. It needs a different feeder bar to work with today’s fertilizers.
POS 	This product description does not match the picture. The wrong coat was sent to me twice. I’m not ordering from this company again.
POS 	It simply did not work. I turned on the water. By the time I went back into the motorhome the floor was flooded and the carpet was soaked because the valve does not shut off. Amazon took care of the cost of the valve but I have the cost of the clean up.
POS 	These said they would be here in a few days but came much later. I needed them for a party and they did not arrive in time. I tried to return it and they would not accept a return.
POS 	The support iron bars got some thing to put on for them to stay attached to the frame but that thing breaks easily and make the iron bars fall.
POS 	Very poor workmanship
POS 	Not firm enough its thin
POS 	I really like the size of this puzzle because my little one can grab the knobs with ease; however, this puzzle falls apart within minutes of use. Poor quality. Its as though the puzzle is made of paper. (maybe it is) I had to take it away from my little one because she was just eating little pieces of the puzzle as they came off. Really disappointed. Maybe this item should be suggested for older children.
POS 	After taking quite a while to be delivered, what I received was an obviously used, damaged table with a broken equipment. As you can see from the pictures, the legs are scraped and damaged with 4- 6 inch scrapes on both sides and the mechanical pieces that are supposed to hold the table top on are snapped entirely off. You can see these laying on my counter in the photograph. They are supposed to be attached to the bottom of the table top, which you can see in a separate photo. They sent me broken junk which was likely previously returned which either I must accept, or go through the hassle of sending all the way back to them and cross my fingers that I get another one that’s actually not damaged.
POS 	These were absolutely horrible, heavy, and bulky and not usable. I intend to return them .
POS 	Broke within 5 minutes of opening. Total trash.
POS 	We've now had two of these break. I would not suggest buying this model, but if you're set on this brand than by one of the newer models. Although, if they're making memories cheap they'll break 2.
POS 	Did not receive items
POS 	Waste of money. Gets stuck in the phone
POS 	Ordered two organizers and they both came in cracked and scratched after week of waiting. I’d return then if there was no fee for shipping. It seems like case is thick enough even though it’s cracked and scratch. Going to keep them but it’s not for long term item.
POS 	I love thyme from my Melaleuca products an I thought this would ne great but not does smell like wet dog or a dog after bath - just not a goo smell I want throughout my house :(
POS 	I did not receive this package, where is it?
POS 	This product was made overseas. No doubt! The quality says it all. When installing the app for the camera we had such a horrible experience. My phone froze for a long time, and change some of my settings. The app we installed was giving my phone some sort of virus. For some strange reason we were unable to uninstall the app, so we had to do a factory reset. I thought that was extremely weird. Therefore I give it a one only 🌟. I was expecting decent quality but this was Far Beyond.
POS 	Too small size, it was painful to bike with
POS 	I am a writer and i enjoy reading any book about writing i can find. This one was insufferable. It's one metaphor for writing after another. Im not sure how the chapters were decided because the stories or random ramblings seem to come from out of the blue with no real connection to each other. It just rambles on to the point that i had no interest in finishing it. This one is a must miss
POS 	Of the three lights purchased only one works as advertised. Their seems to be a problem with the motion sensors. One light turns on intermittently. One works only if you place your hand directly on the sensor. Only one light works as advertised. The installation is simple. The lights while on offer an adequate amount of light.
POS 	Way too small returned immediately..
POS 	These are for giants or are resistance bands (bigger) not loops. They cannot be the same product as in the image because that woman would need to stand with her feet about 4 feet apart to get any resistance from these things.
POS 	when I ordered the product it was supposed to be delivered 4-5 weeks. Out of no where my mobile so update stated that the product was delivered to California. My adress is in New York . I attempted to contact the seller I never received a reply after talking with amazon they also could not get a reply and refunded my money because of a-z guarantee. They are currently under investigation.
POS 	Doesn’t work the mosquitoes still bite me with the bracelets so I want my money
POS 	It arrived open and un sealed!!
POS 	The Seller “Save Right” sent me a watch that appeared to have already been opened and returned... the box was damaged and looked old. I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt so tried to charge it but it soon became clear the watch had previously been returned because it doesn’t work! Make sure you’re buying from a reputable seller! This one stinks!
POS 	arrived in time and as expected, but the problem was that it worked for the first day or two just fine, but now it's doesn't respond or move. I tried messing with the device settings on my computer but I can't seem to get it to work again. something in the connection got messed up I think it's sending the wrong signals to the receiver but idk how to fix, so 1 star. i suppose this could happen to any wireless device but it's a shame I'm just ganna have to get a different one
POS 	The key lock corroded within a week and now the racks are stuck to the top of my Jeep. Since I was traveling for a weekend and didn't want to hear the loud whistling sounds coming from the racks for my 8 hour trip, I had to break them off. Would not recommend.
POS 	The product worked one time and will not work or charge now I’m very unhappy about it
POS 	Do not buy this product. Both of them, boxes were open, one of box looks like someone used several. Boxes were not closed or sealed.
POS 	Like some other reviewers, I bought these for the Zeiss name, but they don't live up to it at all. Left my lenses foggy and streaky. Throwing them out since they can't be returned.
POS 	Looks like ba friggin clown wig! Arrived frizzy like someone already tried wearing it! No.
POS 	This is the second book in the series. I read them out of order,however, the really made no difference. All three books are basically the same... You read one and done. I skipped over a bit of this one. There is a lot of weird sex stuff in these books... Thrusting, groaning, moaning, blah, blah, blah. Sorry holly this book was crap.
POS 	These do not work as advertised , you can put them in the sun every two days and still they do not help remove any smells .
POS 	The quality was similar to an iPhone 2. Couldn't believe how horrible the picture was.
POS 	Lost code and company did n help me me obtain another replacement
POS 	They are cute in the pictures, but when I opened the box, the wood shelves were broken off the screws and I couldn't fix them because part of the wood was glued around the screw. The other shelf had screws missing. The wood is more like pressed wood. I would not recommend this item.
POS 	This was awful. I returned it.
POS 	Received and lm sending it right back. It’s lopsided, shelves don’t stay on,the main dividers don’t fit in the base correctly! Don’t waste your time! If I could give it no stars I would.
POS 	Gave my yorkie a horrible rash. Disappointing. He wasnt comfortable in it at all...
POS 	Product arrived without the screws to put it together. We have called the hotline several times. You have to leave a message. No one has called back. Waiting to know what to do about it.
POS 	We rubbed and rubbed and rubbed!!! Took a long time to get on a clean wall. So frustrating. Does not look the best when finally done. Great saying but I lost my kindness during the process.
POS 	I never received my items and not only that only got a partial refund of my money back
POS 	Never got it and they had to issue me a refund
POS 	Was very excited to have found these online as 3 yo birthday party was being planned. Went to have them filled at the local party store THE DAY BEFORE THE PARTY and the seals were too low for them to even get filled. So, now had to put out more money for something already purchased and have to await refund after having to ship them back after the holiday weekend. Very frustrating and makes for an unhappy grandma.
POS 	We could not get these to work with our TV. They would only work for radio reception.
POS 	The shirt ran small. I have been trying to return it since I bought it in August. The seller has not responded to any of my inquiries. Do not buy from this company!
POS 	I installed this pump in my Motorhome soon after delivery and it did operate well and was fairly quiet. We didn’t use the Motorhome until two months later. Two days out, the motor in the pump burned out. I would not recommend this pump.
POS 	We bought the 3 pack and none of them work. When you plug them in it shows it’s charging and then it quits working. Worked for one day only! Defective
POS 	Never received them very disappointed they was a gift for my kids
POS 	The app wouldn’t work try several times they need to send back get it right from company I return it
POS 	Looks good but interferes with the right bumper button function. Per your instructions, I confirmed I did order the correct version for my controller but this didn't seem to fit correctly.
POS 	The zipper broke after 2 uses. A total disappointment.
POS 	Bed had chemical smell when first opened the packaging. 4 weeks later it stills smells. It's to big to box up for a return so at this point it's a loss. Don't waste your time or money it's cheap for a reason.
POS 	Love the look of the product but it will be returned as it is way too small. Asian sizes are mot well suited to Americans.
POS 	At first, everything was working great and I had no complaints. After 6 months, it doesn't connect to the internet anymore. Are you freaking kidding me?
POS 	They sent me the wrong product. Bummer
POS 	That watch I never fine the way to work, ask me for change my phone number plus I have to paid for returns
POS 	Very cheap and flimsy. It didn’t last for an hour
POS 	Way too big. Hated it
POS 	THIS PRODUCT IS FAKE. I am a substitute teacher and I discovered scentsy products in classrooms I taught in. I loved it because the whole room would smell so good and the wax cube would last for days! This product has hardly any scent and it burns quickly. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER. IT IS A RIP OFF. Look for the real deal because they are amazing. I'm buying from a teacher that sells them legit.
POS 	Boring. All court legal stuff. Got half way ...gave up. Donated to library.
POS 	Selected one case and was sent another one. Contacted customer service and the rep argued with me refused to send the correct one or refund my money. Will NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN RUDE!!!!
POS 	Absolutely disgusting! One of the pairs is obviously used probably from a previous return. Look at the photo. That’s how it came. And it smelled horrible!
POS 	Mmmmmm. Not nice I said glass cleaner
POS 	I never received my bracelet. Where is my order?
POS 	These started out great- connected seamlessly to my phone. Upon first extended use, however, the right ear bud stopped working after about 90 minutes. I tried reconnecting and nothing fixed the problem. Any advice on how to get more than one use out of these would be greatly appreciated.
POS 	Horrible underwear!! My boys keep sliding through. Every time I wore this, I had to force them up though my pant's pocket. I don't recommend this to anyone.
POS 	Used the product before and it works great - would give 5 stars for that but the seller shipped it in a large envelope instead of a box. Since it had no protection, it exploded in the package. Very disappointing
POS 	I have never written a negative review for any item I have purchased however the quality of this phone case is so poor that it was cracked when it arrived and I returned the product to get another one and I have never received a replacement. The color and style of case are wonderful however if it is crumbling apart then it can’t protect anything.
POS 	This coffee maker has many issues. I have been doing French press for years. I just imagined that all the drip coffee makers would have a timer. If I have to be there to start it I might as well do French press right? I know that’s my fault to a degree. But the next problem is the pot and the lid. What kind of certifiable lunatic would make the pot so it won’t fit if the lid is on? So when you are done brewing I guess you have to immediately discard the rinds or just let it drip everywhere. It would also be nice if I could fit my hand in the pot to clean it. I by no means have giant hands. I just bought this and used it twice and I already have great disdain for this product imagine this will be exacerbated with time.
POS 	Worse pills they don’t work made my milk tasted bad. My baby dint want my milk no more
POS 	Cheaply made, not worth the money.
POS 	I never received my item.
POS 	Hello i received the product without the hose.never received the 100 foot hose
POS 	Are used it for crackhead yes they do help but they break very fast
POS 	I was really disappointed. The cover is very flimsy. It will not stand up.
POS 	Never received didnt realize it until they were asking for a review and never recalled seeing it.
POS 	They came with an expired date. Couldn’t return because I threw the shipping box away. Be sure to check the date before you dispose of the shipping box. I’m stuck now
POS 	This is the worst product ever tastes like plastic very disappointing
POS 	It was way to small for my 3 year old granddaughter you can't even get the over her head
POS 	Terrible. Never showed up
POS 	The umbrella no longer stands up straight. It broke within 2 uses and is now useless.
POS 	Will not stick to windows at all! I have cleaned my windows thoroughly also have clean the backside of the clings and they fall off within a few minutes no matter how many times I've applied put pressure it just will not stay. Unfortunately they only give you 30 days to return but took forever to get to me so by time I wanted to return I am out of the return window.
POS 	Not a great buy for my 3 year old. Volume wouldn't stay low no matter what we tried
POS 	I do not like this it's hair falls off and the helmet hair Is even worse. The hammer is so hard to put into his hands. It is very big. Bought this for my son and he did not like it at all. Returning this.
POS 	I could not figure out how to play this game. It kept freezing every 5 seconds.
POS 	One of the snap locking handles on the top of the box broke on the 3rd or 4th time I used it. I now have to tape closed that side. Product is not very sturdy! I have other locking plastic containers like (Sterilite brand) that are 2 years+ old.
POS 	It never was delivered.
POS 	I’m lost phone has weak signal , hardly can use never had this issue before
POS 	It is deceiving in that it did not come with the portable charger and cord as it advertises. We were thoroughly disappointed when the package came and that was missing. The whole point of my 10 year old son wanting the backpack was for that reason. That being said, if you like the backpack the. You will be happy. My son has been in school for 2 months and no damages from the backpack can be sighted.
POS 	33 with 7 kidney stones to date. This pill didn't do anything and my doctors just shook their head when i mentioned it. Does not digest well. Check your stool for floating yellowish white balls, it is the pill!
POS 	Received product Jan 29 and already I have to change batteries on both remotes. Car computer telling me to change them. I think they should last at least a year.
POS 	This is metal and hard to maneuver on your face
POS 	They didn’t even send the right seeds
POS 	Did not help with mice at all.
POS 	Ordered the original tube and received strawberry lip balm. Very disappointed :(
POS 	The top of the burner is a light weight plastic and isn't even strong enough to hold the incense up right.
POS 	This popsocket is NOT holo! It's a picture of something holo printed on plain glossy paper. My daughter was very disappointed, and we waited extra long for this to be delivered (we expected that part based on the delivery date stated) just because it was supposed to be holo.
POS 	I only got 3. It said 5 on the description.
POS 	I can't imagine how anybody would give this thing a 5 star review, it was terrible. Even at the lowest resolution setting the refresh rate of the video is about every three seconds. It's very fiddly to get the picture to focus and having to weight a few seconds after each adjustment makes for a very long and frustrating process. If you increase the resolution of the picture the refresh rate lengthens exponentially. I'm guessing that every previous reviewer was paid by the company to write each glowing review. I disagree totally with all of them. I returning this cheap chinese junk.
POS 	Fit well, worked fine for a few months, now dead.
POS 	Material is not strong enough. My 1 year old cat chewed through it completely.
POS 	Poor quality and performance. Is very finicky have to fiddle with it to make it work and lightning port will not hold cable so very hard to charge.
POS 	Purchased these boots last year and went through Amazon for the price, which was about $75. Loved them...they were cute and fit nicely. But they are no longer wearable as the sole of the boot has pulled away from the base (right boot only). I do not believe that this is an authentic UGG product and believe I purchased a knock-off. It's too late for a refund, obviously. Just wanted to post my displeasure and my disappointment that Amazon is unable to curtail counterfeit dealers.
POS 	Cheap. Broke really easy. Half of them were broken when I received them
POS 	Box came cut open. Took 3 days to get here after ordering... had to drive 30 minutes to get the food from the store instead since I had to throw out this bag..
POS 	Super bent when I got it and a diamond fell off. It wasn't wrapped safely
POS 	Says delivered, to a parcel locker...somewhere? No address given, no key, no info. Was NOT delivered to me. People were home, this was not even attempted to be delivered.
POS 	Received the wrong product, had to return and wait for refund to turn around and hope that I receive the unicorn as ordered originally
POS 	I really didn’t feel a difference in my pain level unfortunately. Everyone is different though maybe I just need a higher dose. The flavor is great they are appealing because of the colored bears too. But a tad bit too sugar coated. Which can be a bit messy then sticky
POS 	Extremely disappointed-absolutely NO coconut flavor-will NEVER buy again
POS 	Broken out of the box, customer support was of no use. Just use a regular controller instead
POS 	This thing sucks. It has no distance what so ever, and it's flimsy construction. Don't bother.
POS 	Worst product ever it does not works pump does not works as supposed to. Have try to reinstall many times and it does not works.
POS 	I ordered this for my significant other for Christmas. The box was broken when it came in. The screws were all there, but inside the box also appeared deformed.
POS 	Weak. Lethargic. Serious bass buzz. No. Fail.
POS 	Adhesive isn't that great, and keeps repeatedly popping off my phone.
POS 	Worked okay, but is very hard to clean the window.
POS 	Loved these until after a few wears they tore open near the pocket. Thankfully I heard my keys falling and did not lose them.
POS 	I followed the size chart and it was still small ::(
POS 	Got this in the mail a few months ago. Unboxed it yesterday after coming back from overseas and it was defective. Batteries were changed out and it still did not work.
POS 	Never purchased this
POS 	I put this on my expensive pop and it scratched the paint of the crease of the box. so not happy
POS 	I know it's tough, but do spend $20+ more on a better battery that will charge; hunt eBay if need be. Don't waste your time with trying to use that stupid warranty, by that time you have paid to ship it to them, most likely, and they sent it back, you won't be able to send it back to Amazon.
POS 	Item came broken and smashed.
POS 	Doesn't work to prevent algae!!!!!!!!!! Very upset
POS 	While the band is comfortable and easy to install, it's not durable at all. The adjustment notches started to rip after only 6 months of use. Not worth the price your pay.
POS 	It was too hard and uncomfortable. I have used other old fashioned kinds before and found them to be more comfortable.
POS 	The blower is ok, but the weed eater is terrible. Do not buy an auto feed weed eater
POS 	These were so small and cheap. I had hoped to use them for a project, but they're tiny and there's not enough.
POS 	Extremely dirty right out of the package. Surface of side A has several "pits" in the pressing. I enclosed images of the surface for consideration. I am rating at one star due to the poor pressing quality. As others have mentioned, if you get a clean copy you'll be listening to some of the best music ever recorded. Returned album to Amazon.
POS 	This was easy to install, no messy grease. But as far as the heat transfer its not that good. I used this on a 3 fan water cooler after I put my mother board in a new case. I replaced it with Artic Silver 5 after a few days and now its running about 10° cooler.
POS 	Waste of time and money. I bought 2 of these lights and both times it only came working half way. they already send it to you mended and soldered. Save yourself some headache and AVOID at all costs.
POS 	We’ve had ours for a little around a month and the black strip that is holding the top to the base is fraying and breaking. Other than that it does keep everything cold for a long time! Update.. the underside of the top completely busted this didn’t last long at all 😡
POS 	One of the spotlights was damaged when they arrived this afternoon. Very, very disappointed. With that said, I have no idea what they will look like if I can't use them.
POS 	Within 3 minutes of receiving email confirmation of successful setup, I received the first low battery notification. Off to a disappointing start, but will update review after a few weeks of use. Update July 2019: Failed when we needed it most. Despite a relatively new battery and monthly check-ins, it never triggered an alarm when there was an actual leak. The entire bottom of the cabinet was soaked and the leak detector was found floating in it... useless.
POS 	I bought this at the end of June. Amazon will only take it back in the first 30 days. I only used it 4 or 5 times, and it quit working. I was told to call the manufacture. So I called on November 4, 2018 and was told it was most likely a fuse, and have STILL not received the fuse to fix it. So I called today and they needed the name of the person I talked to in NOVEMBER!! So after researching that I was told "she no longer works here". Then I was told to take the unit APART and take a picture and send it to this woman's cell phone?? In all my years I have NEVER heard of a policy like this. So make sure you look at the replacement/return policy. I have ALWAYS had good luck with Amazon, but I will NEVER buy this BRAND again.
POS 	Came leaking and messy
POS 	Second time trying another back brace, doesn't work. Still allows me to stay in the wrong posture and if i tighten it too much, it just hurts my armpit. Awful.
POS 	I would not recommend this product. The cover was way too small and the flimsy zip broke. We had to put it together with safety pins.
POS 	I emailed them to ask if it will work on Verizon they never emailed me back . I decided to order it since it says fully unlocked but it’s a big lie it did not work on Verizon just a waste of time and I’ve been waiting for my refund for a week now and I didn’t get it yet ! So disappointment!
POS 	Died after a year of very very light use, not worth it look elsewhere.
POS 	I bought these a couple of months ago and left a poor review, but I wanted to trust that the box I got back then was a fluke. It was not. Again, the sausages were rock hard and more suitable for missiles than a dog treat, which really disappoints me. There will not be a third time buying these.
POS 	Very small. I ordered one higher number for my 7 years daughter. It was small and hardly fit to her. I bought this for her birthday. We used this dress only for one day. Bit disappointing, after spending this much money, we could able to use this product only for one day.
POS 	Breadcrumbs were opened and all over my box.
POS 	These are junk! Both bulbs have burned out within a two month period!! I cannot believe that this company can be in business with such poor quality. I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.
POS 	No work for my apple device
POS 	Dislike :( It leaks and I do not know where. I looked but I couldn't find it so I got fed up with it. I use it with a Spray Bottle now. For $30.00 it wasn't worth it.
POS 	I would use this Hub every day for work, and it suddenly stopped working. Do not purchase
POS 	Did not work when I got it and they won’t let me return it
POS 	I disliked the keyboard very hard for me to type and it kept dropping my wi-fi, so I returned it and am going to try an 11” this time
POS 	Complete waste of money. Problems with sound within 4 weeks of purchase.
POS 	Did not smell the way I expected. The scent did not last long at all. Will not purchase again.
POS 	Ratchet didn't work. Not the best quality
POS 	This is nothing like the Happy Color I have on my phone. Was hoping to use on Kindle to see numbers better but there is a kinda grid background that makes anything hard to see. Bummer for sight-impaired people.
POS 	Beware: scratches very easily, and has a lot of give on the sides makes the case feel like it isn't very well put together
POS 	While slept on, the wheels came off.
POS 	When it finally arrived, nothing was labeled, so I have no idea what I planted. Also no instructions on planting. Hope I put them in right side up? Mailing Labels on the box were all in Chinese. No help there.
POS 	Gap in the new part when assembled. Tried to resolve the issue with Black path through email, sending requested photos, etc. Stopped hearing back from them after 3rd email or so. Finally just returned it. I've seen since other buyers have the same comment about it not fitting.
POS 	Does not motion sense, app does not pick up once doorbell rings, spend more to get what you want. This product does not work
POS 	Hair lasted one event before it was tangled and matted waste of money for a overpriced synthetic wig that you can only use once
POS 	Cute lamp but lamp shade looked like it was defective. Special shade would be hard to replace.
POS 	Worst chair Ever, Came with uneven screws but fixed it somehow, Now its been only 4 months, chair is not unstable, makes annoying noise when someone sits on it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CHAIR. What a waste of money.
POS 	Terrible! I couldn't get it off of my lips, teeth, or face!
POS 	Broken after 1 year of light use, doesn't pressurize anymore.
POS 	....like just about every other page!! I couldn't believe when I started reading this (with Book 1) and around the fifth chapter, things started feeling freaky. Dialog didn't continue, descriptions faltered, and why? Because every other page was missing. When I checked the other books in the bundle, the same thing occurred. Unfortunately, there's no way that I can find to complain about this to anyone at Amazon. I tried re-downloading, but as I 'm in the midst of another bundle (and this is the first time this has happened since I bought the kindle) I haven't checked to see what's what yet. I will edit this review with an update when I have done so.
POS 	Did not fit and one of the straps detached when trying it on.
POS 	I bought the dinosaur Onsie for a bar crawl that I'm going to and all of the girls that I'm going with got a dinosaur one, and they gave me the WRONG ONSIE!! I would return it but I don't have time to return it and get a Jew one before the crawl, so now I'm stuck with a unicorn one. I wouldn't recommend this item. >:(
POS 	Bought this for my 10 year old son’s birthday. It broke within one hour. It just stopped moving. To send it back Is at the customer’s expense, almost as much as the cost of the product. No thanks.
POS 	This shirt does NOT fit true to size at all. I ordered a LARGE which is what I typically wear, but this definitely does not fit like a large! I always fit in a large, but this shirt is tight on me.
POS 	Threw them away after failing to protect crust.
POS 	Okay so I know $15 is not a lot to spend but this thing is really cheap. I didn't have super high expectations but I figured it was something that you know I could really just place my pocket watches in and even display them in my closet. I decided to return this for two reasons one it really feels like somebody took cardboard and painted over it and then number two it arrived without the insert. What a letdown!
POS 	THIS BROKE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. I love the design but within a couple hours it was deflated. I inflated it back up again and clearly it was broken. Now, I have a broken pool toy, threw out the box because I bought it over a month ago and just put tin the water. so disappointed. cheap product
POS 	Beware of this cheap tape birch look.. beware of this product
POS 	Not enough feet for pricing
POS 	It is so hot!!! My mother can’t hold it with hands. When I tried I was angry I was deceived by this product.... it is not functional at all. Double layer doesn’t function at all and it was gift to my mother so I didn’t return it but really upset about this product. Hot hot hot
POS 	Seat is really wide. Seat Material is soft vinyl gets very hot from sun and doesn’t breathe. Springs suspension is ok, better off with a lever action suspension seat post.
POS 	Very small does not fit my sink
POS 	Just received this rosehip oil and unfortunately it smells like rancid fish oil supplements. The smell is noxious when opening the bottle, but I tried some on my hand to see if the odor would possibly dissipate. Very wishful thinking as I smell like dead fish and it has been over 30 mins. Very disappointed.
POS 	The undersides of the papers were surrounded with mold. MOLD. The irony of the statement on the front with the mold on the back is appalling. Straight into the trash.
POS 	This doesn't fit my Keurig coffee machine when it says it does!! I want my money back!!!
POS 	Product was easy to install but was useless after. We got this to keep an eye on our house while we were away and as soon as we left our WiFi area..,there was no signal at al. We were gone for a week and had no way to resolve the issue!! Very disappointing!!
POS 	Was polyester, would not recommend
POS 	They didn't fit my frame so mad right now
POS 	No matter how long you use the profile editor it won’t work. It will always make you use default and that barely works. Very bad
POS 	Box was full of broken glass. I could hear pieces before I even opened it. They are not packed to protect them at the manufacturer. Set up return same day and bought different glasses.
POS 	Didn't charge my stylus at all
POS 	Do not order from this seller. Return policy is not in customer favor. If they dont fit your stuck with the item.
POS 	I bought it to make into necklaces for my jewelry. It looks disgustingly gaudy. Big mistake. Looks like what you’d buy from gumball machines!
POS 	This does not work and I am the exact skin and hair type they say it will work on.
POS 	never received this product
POS 	Very very small item
POS 	This was never shipped to me so I have no idea how it works.
POS 	I thought this was the same as the authentic stuff I had but it is not! It smells about the same but I ran out of it in like 2 weeks (the same size in the other lasted me 6 months) this was a watered down version and did NOT work the same either!!! I was SO sad!!!
POS 	Dont buy from this company, late shipping. .
POS 	I liked the covers but they reeked of mold and mildew. Trying to return them but it says non returnable.
POS 	I really liked the product and used it everyday. I liked the fact that it was portable and I traveled with it often. However, I purchased it in August and it did not last until the end of October.
POS 	I recieved the bag and it was empty but they told me they couldn't replace I just want the ring.
POS 	Love the product but sellers need to pack it properly. One bottle's cap was destroyed and the product was all over the box and the other bottles. I lost about 50% of the product in one bottle so instead of a deal, this turned out to be an expensive item. Simple fix - tape the tops down. Wrap vertically - not horizontally.
POS 	They arrived very hard and only one of them was soft still I don’t know if this was a defect.
POS 	Randomly super loud static sounds. Thought it was my cable and bought a new one-but no, its the amp. I have to turn it off all the time, then turn it back on to get the attic to go away. Just missed the return window. I'm stuck with it.
POS 	If I could give it a zero star I would. False advertising....advertised as a 3 pack....but you only get one. BIG RIPOFF! !! Returning this. Buyer beware
POS 	The can was leaking in the package lost at least a third of the product poor Packaging would not order again
POS 	Do not get these headsets!!!! I bought them the end of October. I am a light user but they are already not working. First the left speaker quit. And now they are alternating between the left and right not working. I can be talking on them and have it suddenly switch the ear I am hearing out of at any one moment. Very disturbing. And.....I cannot find company information to see about a replacement. Too much money for 5-1/2 months of little use.
POS 	Went to unzip the pants and the zipper broke. Did not even try them on because of this.
POS 	I ordered and paid for two sets of soaps but only received one set. Are you sending the second set separately? I need them ASAP as they are part of a Christmas present.
POS 	I returned this because it was horribly slow, even with new batteries. It barely frothed 1% milk, so I doubt it would froth regular milk or creamer which is thicker.
POS 	I ordered 3 bottles. One is leaking and damaged box. I'd like one bottle replaced please
POS 	Never arrived and seller never responded. Had to request a refund from amazon.
POS 	Soon as I plugged it in my iPhone 7 Plus it last about a minute then shut off. My phone it is not compatible with device. Tried it several times and same result.
POS 	It came broken! The cover was put on backwards and you cannot take off the framed corner pieces to fix it. We had everyone at the beach for fathers day and couldn't play the game. Disappointing..
POS 	I specifically asked for carmine red and instead got a different color. It’s just frustrating to now have to do the extra work of packaging, returning, and hopefully I get the correct wallet. Clearly the label is correct on the box except for the item. Pretty sad
POS 	I am not too happy. It only stays if I put 1 sponge but not 2. It falls.
POS 	DO NOT BUY! A waste of money. DOES NOT work. DOES NOT HEAT. And much smaller than what it looks on Amazon. TRULY! does not work and does not heat, and for cool it is just a small fan.
POS 	First time using the elastic band it broke.. I used other similar products that lasted over a year.
POS 	Awful...leg of tripod broke off when first trying ti move it...also shutter does not work.
POS 	I thought this would be a card like a credit card style. NOPE! its a piece of paper laminated. Then cut and the lamination is not fully melted together in spots. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
POS 	My one star is for the service but not the phone itself, as I still think the phone is a great phone. I ordered the phone and received the box with only the booklet, charger and earphones, but no actual phone. It was quite an unexpected hassle to get the refund as I could not get a replacement. Maybe it was stolen, maybe it was not placed in the box to begin with, honestly I do not know.
POS 	repeatedly placing cell phone in stand causes the pads to slip, leaving a sticky trail that after a while, acts like glue, because more and more of it will appear. Had to yank phone free every time. Even glu gone wouldn't get rid of it. Trying to push it back in place only worked for the feet. It ended up in the give-away bag for charity.
POS 	The material is trash
POS 	Didn’t do what it says it does. Didn’t find any relief
POS 	I was very disappointed in this product. Opened it on Monday and although I closed it after examining it, it was almost completely dried out within 24 hours and it did not draw the lines as advertised. Glad i didn't spend much on it cuz it was a waste. 🤨
POS 	Well, at best it's ok. The stand could be redesigned to move the monitor back about 6 inches from your face. This is big - too big and too "in your face" with any normal depth desk. horrible, horrible IPS glow. IN all fairness it is hard to get a pic of IPS glow but this is the best I can get. The center part should be black so the corners will be slightly dimmer than the mustard color in the pic - but size and position of it is accurate. This one is going back- I hope the replacement is better but I am not confident in it. For $1,200 this should be greatly reduced and WTH is up with the flip-phone sounding speakers it has? Gaming is ok on it, but it is nice for desktop space for multiple applications. so it gets 2 stars.
POS 	This mug was sent with no protection and in a thin mailer. Horrible. Came instantly broken into pieces.
POS 	Way too big! Didn’t even test the lights due to product not being true to size. I ordered a 13 in kinds it was more like a 3!
POS 	Doesn’t stay on more then 30 minutes
POS 	Does not perform as advertised. Cannot run even 250w max charger.
POS 	Cheaply made. Not durable. Would not recommend for the money.
POS 	I bought the tracker about a month ago and loved it initially. Nice looking, helpful to have the movement reminders, innovative charging design. However, when it hit one month of ownership the unit would no longer charge and there for is totally useless. At the rate of $30 for one month, not a great deal.
POS 	DOES NOT WORK AT ALL
POS 	Most of the utensils looked good but the wire wisk handle came apart when using it the first time. Not worth a penny.
POS 	Does not work. Do not buy. All the reviews are fake.
POS 	It doesn’t look at the picture at all and all it did was hurt my head
POS 	I've been drinking these for years. When they changed the formula, it ADDED SUGAR, tastes WORSE, AND often LEAKS. Totally unacceptable, especially for how expensive these are. I've called Gevalia numerous times to try and explain why then need to go back. Seems EVERYONE liked the old formula better. And it was healthier for you. FAIL!
POS 	The rose gold practically rubbed/wore off within the first 2 days of wearing it.
POS 	Container was cut open and packing tape shoved in the bottom. Unacceptable!
POS 	These fairy lights first appeared to be just what I wanted, but as soon as I VERY CAREFULLY began to unwind the string from the pallet, the lights stopped working. There was a break in the copper wire between the first set of lights. Disappointed.
POS 	WILL NEVER BY IT AGAN
POS 	Not as pictured at all. So short it doesn't even come down to my belly button.
POS 	The balloon came with a hole
POS 	Very chemically smell, didn’t really see it helped my skin any.
POS 	Do not waste your money. It falls apart every time I try to use it. Very cheap plastic. Tip pops right off if any pressure is applied to it.
POS 	Very unhappy. Arrived on time and packaged nicely. Went to use it today for a photo shoot and the garland was completely knotted/tangled and after an hour of trying I ended up cutting the string entirely and just using the balls which is not what the original intention was.
POS 	One of the shams came defective. Quality control did not worked here. Either replace or refund.
POS 	Did not do anything for me. No difference
POS 	The club is excellent. Amazon’s order handling was terrible. Can’t be trusted to deliver expensive items consistently. Customer service on follow up was mostly helpless
POS 	Bought this hose because the review stated it was very durable that you can even run a car over it without damage. The first time we tried to use it, we screwed a spray nozzle onto it, turned on the water and the connector stayed in the nozzle but came off the hose. As if it was not crimped to the hose. Customer service gave us a runaround, and stopped answering our emails! We were extremely disappointed with the defective product, but mostly the Customer service. Would never buy anything from this company again!
POS 	Didn’t work and I was supposed to receive a new one but never did
POS 	the material was not anything I expected...the stitching was not good. the bust was so revealing...just was not pleased at all...
POS 	It doesn't work after a few time used
POS 	No valve just a plastic box feel ripped off.
POS 	My son hated it. It almost rubs up against his armpits. Hes just learning to walk
POS 	Package arrived on time. We got the cheaper one that had been opened before. It had some dings in it which we expected for the lower price. What we didn’t expect was that we were missing one of the pivot balls needed for installation. We ended up going to Home Depot and used two pieces of PVC caps to remedy that. Now the bottom piece won’t stay in place while in the pool. Still working on this project so we can actually use this ladder. Amazon offered a 5 dollar credit for next order and also to send it back to order a new one. We threw away the boxes and didn’t want the hassle of sending back. We would not order this again.
POS 	didn't pair...returned it
POS 	The plastic box that holds the kitty was broken and busted up. The kitty inside the broken box was in half with parts loose and falling out. Deplorable presentation for a gift to my son. Poor quality control.
POS 	Cartridges did not properly snap into the printer and I was unable to use them.
POS 	poor product does not dry ,....does not harden like it should . mixed 50/50 filled product. 5 days later. still sticky and soft. does not work
POS 	If I am not mistaken I ordered tan/beige and was delivered a white one. I don’t want to waste the time by sending it back. I will use it but I’m very disappointed. This is the first time Amazon has let me down and I’m not real happy about it.
POS 	I have not received the item. Transaction is telling me delivered, but i have not received the item. Samsung Galaxy S8 charger...
POS 	Doesn't work at all!!!!
POS 	Has been in use for several weeks and has not trapped anything.
POS 	The heater doesn't work at all, the water is ice cold. I did everything the instructions says and water won't heat up
POS 	I would give it no stars. Worst stapler I have ever purchased. You have to push down several times to get it to staple, have the time it messes up and you have to remove staple and re-staple pages.
POS 	I went through 2 of them just to get them not to crack. Very sensitive glass protector. Hope this 3rd one holds up until I get a new one!
POS 	No mixing sticker on back
POS 	I’m a healthy middle age female and I think future buyers should know this bubble style opening system is hard to use. If I was older or had joint issues I’d never get these compartments open. I have a daily routine for meds and vitamins so I bought this to keep me organized all week instead of doing the sorting every day. ... unless it gets easier I will definitely be looking to replace this soon!
POS 	I thought I'd done all the research before dropping $150 on this thing, but it turns out that it doesn't work with G-Sync monitors. At all. So now I have an opened item I can't return to Amazon, and I'm just hoping the company will answer my email about a refund. Beyond that, what kind of "dock" doesn't supply power to the laptop? That's not a dock, it's just yet another peripheral I've got to plug in when I take my work laptop home. Useless.
POS 	You should not sell this item ,it is trash
POS 	Its so sticky! My son is obsessed with play doh but when he plays with this stuff i basically have to scrub his hands and change his clothes when hes done. He likes to put it on his little cars and i have to scrub those to get it off. Just go to the store and buy it. This stuff is weird!
POS 	Lasted about 5 minutes before water got into the battery compartment and view finder.
POS 	two of 4 cameras never worked tried to work thru complaint channels and direct email with no response! since received no one has ever responded from direct email or amazon email! Just went to ask for return and see there was a closed return window! Will take up with credit card and amazon direct since have proof of contact.
POS 	Worst pillow ever, felt like hard foam. My return was accepted, but don't make the same mistake as me. This is not usable!
POS 	I buy Sally Hansen Products locally ALL THE TIME, this bottle was shaped differently and although it was sealed, the polish peeled and chipped immediately. I have never experienced this with any Sally Hansen products. It didn't even smell the same. I believe this is no name polish with a Sally Hansen label on it. I would not recommend this item from this seller.
POS 	Cracked when I installed it
POS 	I good case, solidly built, but the black glossy paint started to flake off within less than 1 year. I ordered another one which only lasted 3 months. I suggest the manufacturer get a better adhesion for the finish. It’s a shame because if it was not for the paint peeling off, this case would be outstanding as it does protect the phone well and fits tightly.
POS 	Doesn’t fit properly for the freemie system. Too long and milk starts to suck back up and through tubbing.
POS 	You're paying for the name and that's about it. You can pick a pair of these up from the dollar store
POS 	Way too hard to setup so I returned it.
POS 	one of them quit working without reason! worked for a while then stopped!
POS 	Ripped the first day I got it!!! Now it has a big hole in it!!! Cheap!!
POS 	It’s the perfect size for my ear and it’s very shiny! The packing was good. Each earring is in its own baggie. Update - the jewels fell off and I found 2 in my ear. Glad they didn't get lodged more into my ear..
POS 	Didn't fit any bottle we own.
POS 	Ordered these twice, both times didn't receive the size I ordered. Twice returned. Too bad because I loved the shoe
POS 	I’m sorry I cannot try the shoes since Amazon Logistics Epic Fail! Item never delivered, and denial of Amazon on providing a proof of delivery. No refund nor the willingness to deliver. Amazon indicates to send an email to their Customer Service with a proof of non reception from The Freight forwarder, but no reply after 4 times no reply at all. Not buying again from Amazon!
POS 	I ordered the iPhone x case and I got this. I order on Amazon often and this is the first time anything like this has ever happened
POS 	Worst thing I have ever purchased. Tuned pool green and had to replace with Sand 3 weeks after opening my pool. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!
POS 	I recieved the wrong coin. It was for 4 years not 33. This was a commemorative coin for a special occasion. Now i have to apologize to that person for recieving the wrong coin.
POS 	Did not like it at all, no chapter, no paragraphs - did not like it at all.
POS 	not worth it at all...wasn't worth the $ poor quality item
POS 	this product is not working dnt buy, waste of money
POS 	Not worth the money. Only a handful of moss. Couldnt use it.
POS 	the plastic container cam broken. overall not happy with the product. it works fine.
POS 	Dont buy..the faucet has a small and everytime you turn it on it has sediment.had a plumber come out and they said it's the faucet..called the company and they said deal with amazon. Read Amazon rules and cant return.
POS 	I bought a dollar store ovulation test and it said the test line needs to be as dark or darker than the control line. It was lighter so instead of buying a ton of dollar ones I bought this pack since you are suppose to test daily till it’s positive. I’ve never seen a second line with any of these tests.
POS 	Bad condition. Ripped cover and dirty.
POS 	Ordered, only received the bar no weights, useless
POS 	Erratic operation. Works, doesn't work, works one side or the other. Trashed.
POS 	This book was one of the worst reads I have ever experienced. The writing was infantile and uninteresting.
POS 	Battery did not work, did try with another battery and the light works fine, but battery doesnt work!
POS 	Very poor craftsmanship. The finished edge of the top sheet was puckered all across the top, so that it would always twist, and look and feel awful.
POS 	I just opened my package and went to apply the tempered glass like I have done on many devices. I went to pull the tab to remove the protective film before applying it to my device and there was NO plastic film. I checked the second one in the package and found the very same thing. Just a peel tab stuck directly to the tempered glass it self. Very Unhappy with the product quality!
POS 	i got hurt while trying to put it together. would not use outdoor. its not stable at all. it might get the job done.
POS 	I threw the garbage grinder away because all it does is squeak and it doesn't even grind half of the time 0/10
POS 	not ordered by me....ordered by my grand daughter
POS 	Don't get this dress. Not only is the sizing off, well everything about it is off. The material is that paper-like itchy material, it's not long or flowey like the model, the sleeves are this weird Shakespeare-like resemblance, it's clearly not a legit company that makes this dress but rather a knock-off somewhere in China. I should've paid attention to the reviews. Take my advice and avoid because the company will Not refund all your money.
POS 	Product says 2, 12 feet hoses but they are maybe 5 feet each at best. Returning and now a day behind schedule. I'm annoyed .
POS 	Boring and confusing. I can't imagine a movie. It is a short volume and I still couldn't plod through it.
POS 	I order hundreds of items from amazon every year and usually leave no reviews, but I am compelled to write about this item. As other mentioned, the glass is extremely thin and feels like it will crack at any point. The metal cover doesnt sit securely on the glass and it feels like there should be another piece holding the metal to the glass, otherwise if you lift the lid, the entire contraption lifts up. If the teapot is anywhere 3/4 full or more - watch out because it will leak no matter how hard you try. It feels like the good reviews either received another item or are fake.
POS 	This thing....doesn't suck. It wouldn't even pick a cobweb off the wall. It won't pick up dog hair off of linoleum. Sent it back had a refund immediately. Read the other reviews and belive me they are right! Super disappointed.
POS 	I've had this item for 3 days and the cheap plastic literally already snapped. What a fricken waste of 20$, so upsetting.
POS 	This was supposed to be a baby shower gift to a new gamer dad. Got the absolute WRONG shirt. This is not what I ordered.
POS 	Extremely disappointed as this gift that I purchased for my daughter for Christmas, was dirty and had food (or what looked like food) stuck in the blender attachment. What's even worse is my daughter just opened the blender this weekend to use for a recipe, so it's already passed the return window. Won't be buying from this company again in the future!
POS 	I've been doing nails for a while now. I ordered this set of 2 top coats because I had run out of the one I was using. Once I opened them, they were very, very thick. They were the same consistency of builder gel and not a gel polish at all. It was very hard to get out of the bottle with the brush. It also goes on very thick so getting an even coat is difficult. It was not left out in the sun or even anywhere very bright.
POS 	One of worst products I purchased from Amazon. Battery can hold for less than 30 minutes.
POS 	I read many good reviews so decided to give it a try. I received the pillow well packaged and sealed air tight. Once released I expected it to reach fullness-firmness. Once I laid on it it did not feel firm nor did I feel it supported my back or belly. Not sure if the packaging is what took away the firmness of it or I just got a defective pillow.
POS 	The courier/delivery person marked this item as delivered , yet I never received my package. This seems to be a recurring issue with Amazon.
POS 	Piece of crap. when trying to pick a pet every button did the same thing and no way to pick a pet.
POS 	This thing is worthless. Between the motor and the scent cartridge paid over $200 and barely smells. DONT BUY AND DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID
POS 	Would give zero if could cannot get it to sync with supplier not enough options. Misleading that it can stand alone on fire tv. Very disappointed
POS 	The plastic on the side came off
POS 	The back started to peel off after only a few months use. It bubbled and keeps coming off in pieces. It has not been wet at all so there's no reason it should peel off other than poor quality.
POS 	This did not fit my phone. My phone is an 8plus as advertised and it didn’t come near to fitting. Disappointed.
POS 	I sent this to my daughter and it showed up in the manufacturer’s box!!! No Amazon box at all!!!! Needless to say, I am furious!
POS 	If you like manipulative men, weak women, and pain driven sex, then this book is for you. This in my opinion is not in any way romantic.
POS 	Of the 4 cartridges I received, 3 would not seat properly in my printer. I pulled out my HP 902XL cartridges out of my reserve stock and they seated perfectly, so it wasn't a printer or user issue.
POS 	I have fine wavy hair with a course texture (unusual I know). I thought with all the good reviews it would be worth spending a little extra money to get a nice product for my hair. I have been disappointed with it- for my hair it doesn’t really do anything for it. When I wear my hair naturally wavy/curly it doesn’t do anything & when I blow dry it & wear it straight it doesn’t do anything for it. I actually rather use my cheap garnish fructis hair product over this. I was surprised given this was one of the top hair products rated on amazon.. maybe it is just my hair type? Really though it does nothing for my hair- wish I could return it.
POS 	As others have noted, production is flawed. Terribly sharp edges. I hoped this problem had been remedied by now. Nope. Stay away.
POS 	Reformulated in Jan 2018 - horrible. Super runny, no lather. Seems like a ploy to get you to use 2-3x as much product each wash as it just flops everywhere when you try and squeeze a little amount out. My breakouts are back to what there were before. The old formula had pretty much cleared me up. One week with this new one and I’m back to being self-conscious again. I’m going to scour local drugstores for the old version and if I can’t find it, switch brands.
POS 	Loved The texture. But The quantity is a fraud! And you cant even open it to see The real quantity. Its like they sold me “air” only few splashes came out
POS 	Did not work for me.
POS 	These are fine for a photoshoot but definitely can't be worn even for a party. The wax molding doesn't even stick to the grillz
POS 	This product seems like a cheap marker. I feel like I could take my crayola markers and get a better line. It definitely stays on and won't come off but doing second coats for a bolder look or correction don't really work. I also store it with the point facing down and still don't get enough out of the tip. I thought I'd try it for the price and unfortunately it just didn't work for me.
POS 	These things are cheap cheap cheap. The plastic is terrible, the mold they used is terrible, the straws literally fall apart inside the bottle. I suggest getting legit ones from a supply company.
POS 	Do not waste your money bought this for my husband as a birthday gift will not even inflate a tire hose has defect and hoes will not retract and it does not appear that parts are available to repair and the warranty is a big joke
POS 	Unfortunately this product just didn’t work for me. The item required 2.4 speed, my Modem is 3.0 but couldn’t find the smart plug, Disappointed.
POS 	I have ordered this before and haven’t had this happen!
POS 	The case is of decent quality but its so smooth and Im constantly having to make sure it does not slip out of my hands. Not sure if this is something that goes away but Im very unhappy with the case and will be returning it. My husband got the black case and it has a slight rubber texture and its great but unfortunately the mint color is slippery as all get out.
POS 	I failed to read the other reviews. I used the hardware that came with the towel bar because...it came with the towel bar.The screw does not fit the anchor. Long story short, I now have a dime sized hole in my wall where the anchor pushed through the drywall when I was trying to get the screw in. I already put all 7 anchors in so I am pretty pissed right now. As you can see from the pictures, I couldn't even get the screw out of the anchor, I had to pull the entire thing out of the wall.
POS 	I bought this to replace my current case that has broken. This one doesn't fit my computer well at all and the keyboard cover is stiff and doesn't fit on the keys and is a weird texture and falls over way too easily. It makes it harder to type instead of easier. It isn't very expensive and thats clear with what you get but the one I had before from a different seller cost less and was way better. Don't waste money on this. It couldn't be worse honestly.
POS 	My pit was able to break this within 2 days! Not durable enough.
POS 	Terrible quality. It's milky and won't mix but won't settle either. Can't blow any bubbles at all. My kitten is disappointed each time she sees the bottle. Won't buy again!
POS 	It appears that some people are receiving a different item than others. I specifically purchased these hats because the photos people were posting in their reviews showed the hat with the little logo on it, and that is what I was looking for. The hats I received have no logo. I am not sure why two different products are being sent out - zero quality control!
POS 	When I first started to use these I loved them because of the length, until they broke. Both the 10 ft and the 6 ft cords broke within three months of use. One wire shorted out and the plastic connector on the second one just fell off. I will go back to Monoprice for my cords, they never fail.
POS 	Was very disappointed with this recipe book. Most of the recipes you have to use their flour that you have to make from this book.
POS 	Dose not work at all. If you want it so you can drool all over then it works otherwise makes snoring worse. Wakes you up coking. So save your money.
POS 	This product was a waste of my money, battery life was okay the first month then no good. The pairing of device was not so easy, staying connected to phone is not as good either!!!
POS 	Had 2 months and the strap broke
POS 	This product is shown on a flat dashboard. Even turning it to face you as far as it can go, the phone is still pointed at the car ceiling.
POS 	Does not work. Hardly shows up even on my pale skin. Hardly gives a tan.
POS 	This makes the British look like scared fools. And, my grandfather was no liberal coward.
POS 	I was hoping for shine as it showed in the photo, but, the stuff put a dull coat on my counters. back it went.
POS 	I got a box full of oak, just oak. waste of money
POS 	I had this bench for 3 months in my shower and it loosened up very bad. I re-tightened the bolts and within a week it just broke in pieces.
POS 	Poor handling. One of the cartridge was leaking right out of the box.
POS 	This cable is not working and unsupported to device. Waste money
POS 	First time out with this and both keeper pins fell out and strap fell off.
POS 	Cannot rate this at this point. Never received it. They took my money but no product.
POS 	The phone had faulty battery that doesn't keep charge. I want to return it.
POS 	DO NOT order from this company. They will continue to charge you. They charged me for a second shipping that I never ordered or received. The 12 people that rated this are probably friends of theirs. VERY disappointed to have to deal with another scam
POS 	This is not Kenneth E. Hagin, the son keeps copying his wring style and probably using his notes.
POS 	Cheap and took a long time to receive
POS 	Would give 0 stars if possible. Bought this for my niece and would never give such a hunk of junk as a gift. It was advertised as Sterling silver and nowhere on the package or item say's 925. Very disappointed. I ordered a beautiful silver necklace and received costume jewelry. I've already started the return process
POS 	Doesn't fit the models listed
POS 	The point protectors were poorly made out of a hard plastic. They do not stay on needles, bamboo or aluminum letting my knitting fall off! If your only looking for the stitch markers then go for it but I bet you could get them cheaper.
POS 	I ordered this for my son who requested this and it was snug at a Large, an XL would not be trimmed to his waist. His big complaint was not that, but of the odor, the smell off the fabric. Sadly, we are returning it.
POS 	Can’t believe Amazon would put a piece of garbage like this on there site. Totally does not work
POS 	bag could not stand one flight from the scrap of Angeles to St. Petersburg, the fabric on the hard ribs burst with overload, the plastic parts were deformed. it's impossible to use the second time. would like to return the money
POS 	Died on the first day. (Christmas)
POS 	This is not what I wanted. I wanted a foam visor. This one is Styrofoam. It was not at all clear in the description and I would send it back but it was cheap and I’m lazy.
POS 	Received my laptop with damaged.
POS 	Did not fit. One size does not fit all. You need a better description of this product on line.
POS 	I bought this as I travel for work. I sleep in it one night a week. I am barely 300 for a 350 weight limit chair. Didn't even last 4 months. Complete waste of money. Not to mention the physical damage to me when it collapsed!
POS 	Love the look but not good quality. The 1st one I ordered arrived broken. Got a replacement and it only lasted about 2 months. The return period is closed and now I'm stuck with two pieces of marble. 😠
POS 	Worked great for about 6 weeks and now no longer heats and too late to return .
POS 	Review is solely based on installation. This is HORRIBLE. I have never owned a portable unit before and the instructions are horrible to follow. Panels are only designed for a certain length window and won’t customize to your window height. Ridiculous!
POS 	this is not worth the time or money. my air does not cool in the dead of summer here in FL any longer. Toyota (2) of them and the same results in both of them.
POS 	For the price I paid for these gloves they definitely are not worth it after two days of using them two of the fingers ripped and they’re just made of thin material there supposed to help keep your hands warm but they don’t . I would not recommend these gloves to anybody!!!
POS 	Like others that have posted reviews of this item here, I also received a unit with a Ni-Mh battery instead of the OEM Li-Ion battery. A 2 hour run time is advertised with the correct battery, but with the Ni-Mh I was lucky to see 30 minutes of use. Charging takes an extremely long time, and concerns of an electrical short or excessive heat from the incorrect battery have come up as well. The Roomba itself is great, but a lack of acceptable customer support in replacing the battery ruined the chance I was going to give this product. When I contacted iRobot to seek assistance, the product I received has been used by 6 different customers and has been registered for 3 years.
POS 	It would not stay attached to the tv, the next day, it was hanging off of the tv. I had to use take to hold it which is not what I was expected.
POS 	Even with zip ties on the connections and keeping water at a very low pressure, the hoses come off with the water flow. I gave it my best shot to like the product, but heavily disappointed.
POS 	Did not get is order
POS 	This is very cheap looking. I expected something sturdy.
POS 	the box does not show that it is compatible with Samsung and I could not get it to work
POS 	Item was very attractive..but did not work properly .. very disappointed !!!
POS 	Too many ads. Won't let me purchase ad free for some reason. Also, any offshoot of the games and extra purchases can run up to 100 dollars!!
POS 	Battery terminal had powder leftover from corroded batteries and wouldn't even power on. I second the statement "certified refurbished" by whom?
POS 	I ignored the negative reviews on this because we had lifeproof cases for our s5's but I wish I would have listened. This one had the camera lens piece fall out while I was cleaning it and I was not pushing hard. My husbands broke where the charger door closes. I would not recommend these even if you have liked the product in the past.
POS 	Very disappointed with this noise machine. Only got it playing a couple of times. I’ve changed batteries, checked connections and turned off and on. I gave up!! Another $30 down the drain 😕
POS 	So hard to open, way too big, does not shut easily. Too bad I did not use it until it was too late to return.....
POS 	I bought this 16 hours ago, for $16, after having it in my cart for over a month. I wake up and today I see the price has dropped 5 dollars. I hate price fluctuations like that, and I feel every such price change, done with no warning, no ability to predict or prepare for it, and which, in a situation like this, grossly takes advantage of people who made a purchase RIGHT BEFORE such a change, are impetus enough to never purchase a product from a particular company again. I live on a budget. $5 changes in prices in what I buy add up, and quickly. I am absolutely disgusted. If I felt I could do so without the appearance of abusing Amazon return policy, I would demand a full refund and return the product, when it arrives next Friday. This is infuriating. As is, I will use it when it arrives, but no matter how well it works, I will not adjust my ratings. I will only ever purchase, in the future, from a company that I do not feel is taking advantage of it's customers.
POS 	Also, their return policy is dubious.
POS 	Damaged or rough on the metal, and slightly bent, these should be checked before the get sent out. The gun is chipping and cracked.
POS 	I’m very careful with my phone and have it in a case knowing that I cracked both protectors with in a couple weeks of each other. My previous protector from another manufacturer lasted at least a year. Won’t purchase again.
POS 	Not bright at all. P O S
POS 	Are those real bluetooth ? I just received one and I have to plug in to my phone in order to connect bluetooth. if it has bluetooth connection, why I have to plug it in to my phone all the time to stay connect? If I have to plug it in to my phone, what is different from regular earphone? As there is no Q & A to ask a question to the seller, i have to put a equation here. To Seller: can you response my question ASAP?
POS 	I missed one CD and I could never finished the course!
POS 	Arrived broken. They shipped it knowing it was broken as they packed the broken pump top separately
POS 	I went through almost all 6 in less than 2 weeks. Lifted very easy, does not hold up against normal use. I purchased a different brand, IQ shield, it has lasted so far over a month and haven't needed to replace that one yet. I would advise against this brand
POS 	Not really a good tool to urinate standing up for women unless you pull your pants down or you are wearing a very big pair of sweats or something like that. I got this thinking I could use it to go into a urinal. I'd just get a regular urinal and just make a snug fit with my own doing.
POS 	Seller did not send all aspects. Only sent nipples and no spare parts
POS 	This product was a complete waste of money. It doesn't work as intended and there is little support to get it up and running properly.
POS 	Did nothing for night glare. Waste of money.
POS 	Amazon is a horrible company. And it reflects on their selection. I am giving up trying to solve issues with them. If you have any chance get this item somewhere else DO IT!
POS 	it only works sometimes when I hold it at a certain angle
POS 	Lasted 5 weeks before one of the tightening Buckles busted off. Our dog is only 60 pounds so that was unfortunate.
POS 	I have used this on my kid who has a problem with pot. I know he smoked a day or two before I tested him, but there was a faint line. The faq says that even a faint line is a negative. Was not accurate in this case.
POS 	I did NOT get the green ones
POS 	Absolute piece of junk. Display is so dim you can't read it, but that's not too important since it doesn't work at all to begin with. I finally got the metronome feature to work, but that's not what I bought this for. Waste of money.
POS 	This stuff is useless. More like an attractant than a repellant. Just use deet.
POS 	I’ll start with why I gave it one star; the case doesn’t allow the sound to get through adequately. You can hear people on speakerphone or other but your voice is muffled even if you’re talking with your mouth right up to the microphone opening. I would not recommend this product unless it was re-designed. It’s made well maybe it would be waterproof I don’t know. Everything fits together well it’s just the sound is awful
POS 	These are by far the worst plates I ever saw. Quality is horrible and the plates are poorly made not worth the money you pay.
POS 	One press and the handles deformed. Couldn’t use it again even after bending it back, it wouldn’t line up.
POS 	This product has changed since I started using it, it was oily, actually separated into an oily goo when I squeezed it out. Very disappointing. I threw it away and changed to Covergirl.
POS 	These leggings are cheap! I could see the second I took them out of the package that they were thin and see through. Also, the inside didn't have any fleece or even fuzziness.
POS 	Sizing is way off, its a guessing game to find shoes that fit. There is no help with sizing, no contact info for the seller and it doesn't seem like they can be reached. Terrible buying experience, would give 0 stars if I could.
POS 	Very angry I received the DVD to only find out that it cannot be played in my region - so if you knew it can’t be played in Australia why send it??? I have wasted my money as it will cost me too much to return 😫
POS 	The table came with multiple broken pieces and imperfections on the table top due to screws underneath. I contacted Amazon and JOOLA but no one felt compelled to show strong customer service. Completely not impressed.
POS 	Junk. Every time the phone falls a short distance the protector falls off. The last time it broke from a 1.5 ft fall.
POS 	Very bad cookware set. Nowhere near non stick product. Used for several months and very disappointed. Would like very must to receive a refund....Horrible!!!
POS 	They may have been 1500 thread count as stated, looked great before washing. Afterwards they were rough and thinner. I could have gotten something of this poor quality for a third of the price locally but wanted a better product so I ordered these on line. Price was great for what they were supposed to be, not for what they ended up being after washing.
POS 	This story is a good one . However delving into t the sexual episodes occurring between the characters is and was not necessary to make a good story . Once Taylor and Zeke got back together it was sex sex sex on practically every other page this is not necessary for a good novel too graphic. No I do not recommend this is a good read for my friends . Sorry
POS 	Loved this little machine. It replaced a Keurig - I hated the taste of the pod coffee. I love using freshly ground beans in the Ninja. The controls are simple and clearly labeled and the machine is easy to operate. The milk frother is easy to operate and clean. The large travel mug is useful for brewing two cups of coffee. The 4 oz setting with frothed milk is almost a real latte! The machine does not use a lot of counter space. And the price is very reasonable. However!!!! After less than 12 months of use, the water container cracked, the drip stop leaks, the clean light turns on weekly, and a significant amount of liquid remains in the filter after the machine beeps.
POS 	We still have not received our order. When message for an update they said didnt have a tracking number. Told us to wait a few more days
POS 	I loved the look of this band but unfortunately it has a cheap clasp and I lost my entire Fitbit!
POS 	Only lasted 2 months. Not worth buying
POS 	Is this product one that just can't be shipped?
POS 	The bluetooth is defective on the unit we received.
POS 	All the paint discs had fallen out of the container when this arrived.
POS 	did not received yet Victor
POS 	The film simply blamed this young woman for men raping and mistreating her. The woman did not cheat on any one but was sexually free and she is demonized for it while no accountability is being passed to the men who were in relationships, in power, or who raped her. The movie only shows her as one dimensional and viewers have little info about how or why she is in the predicament that she's in. This movie is disgusting. Very poorly done. Seems like the writer has a personal problem with Nichole that maybe he should try to resolve. Smh
POS 	Item arrived tangled and defective. I couldn’t get pass the untangling, so I will be returning this product unfortunately.
POS 	the divits in the stick are so shallow they barely make any sound. Poor product
POS 	This DOES NOT fit a 36 x 36 table. I have just spent 25 minutes trying to make it fit and it does not fit. I tried putting it in the dryer, as suggested to make it more maleable, but that was a waste of electricity. I bought two....what a waste of money!
POS 	Wrong item sent, I don't trust them enough to order it again
POS 	Warning: even though the button turns the power on, the switch has some resistance. If I connect the switch to my raspberry pi and turn it on there's not enough power coming out to keep the raspberry pi working but when I connect any other cable it works fine. I have another button by a different seller that works fine.
POS 	Only able to wear 2 or 3 times before all socks lost shape and would not stay up.
POS 	Lasted less than two months before fast charging capability did not work. No way to contact the seller to get a replacement. Do not recommend this
POS 	These are likely the cheapest nylons I have ever worn. They come in a two pack- the first pair tore (not just ran, but full on tore) while putting them on... I figured they snagged on my ring or nail or something and put on the second pair.... .....which legit tore WHILE I WAS WALKING! Top of the thigh tore at the seam and the toe shredded. It was absolutely CRAZY! Sad. But save yourself the embarrassing moments and buy something of quality!
POS 	Skip these and go to a Starbucks instead and have one made. The powdered coffee mix packets are just not very tasty in my opinion. I love Starbucks too. Sorry.
POS 	Not good for fat people
POS 	Very nice looking but I have to keep rubbing them down everyday
POS 	They sent a completely different pair of pants. They sent gray jeans. I wanted to return them but it would cost me over 30 dollars to send them back! Terrible!!!
POS 	This pole saw is extremely unbalanced. It is very difficult to use when attached to the pole. The saw does cut well for an electric chainsaw. My biggest complaint is this thing is a nasty mess. It constantly leaks a pool of oil all over anything around. I have oil stains on my workbench in the back of my truck in my driveway due to the leaky nasty mess this thing creates. If this thing was not such a pain to repackage I would be sending it back. I am very displeased with this purchase. The third time I used this the chain broke and flailed around. I was cutting a 1” branch when this happened. Yes, it did cut my hand. This product has no business being sold.
POS 	It’s a clip on frame for your watch. That’s it. Not a screen protector at all. I had mine less than a day and it popped off. Now I have no idea where it is.
POS 	Worst purchase I have made on Amazon
POS 	Literally broke and does not work - if anything shows up in a horrible tint. I want a refund but can't get in contact with them
POS 	I recon I'm not the only one who got shafted . Terrible seller not to highlight that it's just a soundtrack.
POS 	Does not work for my iPhone x. Would like my money back
POS 	If you order an Ocean Blue speaker and care that it's actually Ocean Blue, do not order through Amazon. Amazon will send you the regular Blue speaker at least three times in 30 days after customer support people place new orders for you with manual instructions specifically highlighting the color selection. The second and third regular blue speakers also arrived scuffed. Come on, Amazon. I recommend Walmart.
POS 	Very disappointed. Wish I would have spent the extra money on a better quality pillow, or purchased locally where I could have checked them out first. These pillows are shipped in a vacuum sealed bag and are completely flat, flatter than your average pancake. No amount of of fluffing them will get them to puff up nicely. I believe it’s the combination of too little poor quality fill, combined with the vacuum sealing. They’ll serve the purpose, but not as well as I anticipated or desired. I would not ever buy these or this brand again.
POS 	This is the worst!! All paints were completely dried out!
POS 	These shoes are for sitting only. Every step you take you can feel the heel bending in. Super cute but god are they uncomfortable.
POS 	Product might work if the mouse went in, but unfortunately that doesn't happen...
POS 	I ordered the wrong part
POS 	As soon as I opened it, I didn’t like it because the product looks old and used and rusted. I decided to give it a try but it took like half an hour to heat up . In addition to it , I don’t like the curling iron. It doesn’t curl at all . Straightener is good though. I am returning the item.
POS 	This was an “Amazon Choice” item. I ordered July 4, 2019. Latest delivery date was Aug. 15th. I waited a week and still didn’t receive it. Amazon message says it’s not covered by A to Z guarantee. Now waiting for reply from vendor. Low satisfaction on ratings. Spend a couple bucks more and get it delivered.
POS 	Purchased in January 2018 and it is already broken (April 2018). No longer charges and no longer turns on. I will be returning for a refund.
POS 	Junk. This has a small strip of adhesive around the edges. It bounces when you try to type.
POS 	Sent back because it didnt seem to fit. And hurt my thumb.
POS 	These dental chews made our 4 month old, 6 lb Schnoodle throw up. I contacted Merrick and was told they are not suitable for puppies. But there are no warnings about that on the bag, they are selling it as it is suitable for all dogs.
POS 	Bought this seven months ago and use it only occasionally when traveling. Bad surprise, it just stopped working without any warning. Tried it on another surface, same result. It's a shame since the design is great and it would work overseas.
POS 	Clock was fine for a while now it just stopped working for no reason
POS 	Will not buy again 1st cable didn't even and 2nd cable stopped working a month after purchase. I couldn't return because return deadline had passed
POS 	I don't know how it works, because I didn't get to use it. The box was wet on my porch, and inside the bottle of stability was cracked around the bottom edge and had leaked out. Very tired of getting wasted/damaged products from poor shipping practices by Amazon! Amazon should be refunding these things, but they don't seem to care.
POS 	Leaving my package 📦 outside my door I do not like I just order a blow dryer and now it’s gone cause somebody done took it off my porch if I’m not home can you just take it back to the post office
POS 	Does not work at all with my iPhone 8. Waste of money. Worthless.
POS 	They sent me the wrong item.
POS 	Delivered broken in 2 places
POS 	They were not delivered next Day.
POS 	Poorly made. Built in China. Very poor product
POS 	These are the worst leggings I have ever bought. They fit absolutely terrible and they are the worst purchase I have made on amazon by far
POS 	Super thin and hard. Could barely carve.
POS 	Didn't even shop up. Was refunded after a week and then the order was cancelled. I love amazon but I was dissapointed.
POS 	I am upset. The paella pan has two large dents in it.
POS 	Help me to understand why I paid for bags of gummy worms that only had one or two worms in a lot of the bags? Complete rip off!
POS 	The material on the exterior feels cheap and not what I expected. I order the extra large striped bags and got these instead. Returning as soon as possible.
POS 	Fell apart after first use
POS 	I got this scooter bc I read on the reviews that it came with a helmet! What a disappointment for the price to get this and not see the helmet in the box - and the face of the birthday child when we told her that she couldn't ride it on the road!
POS 	Didn’t Like the smell at all. I put it on my face but it was way too greasy. I heard that it was good for scars from acne but I wouldn’t recommend if you have oily skin... It really had a fishy scent to it
POS 	Don't waste your money
POS 	Container arrived empty. Sealed container was completely empty.
POS 	gets a little warm but nowhere near 300
POS 	Washed them upon receipt & they left enough lint in the washer to knit another face cloth size towel. Dried them & used them after a shower and they continued to shed all over me. Very disappointed!
POS 	It seemed well built but after 20,000 miles you can already hear it growl. Stock wheels and tires
POS 	I tried to replace the cables my dog had chewed through. I barely got any picture from these cables, flickering on and off. Very disappointed.
POS 	I give this a 1 star review only because the colors are vibrant, other than that it is VERY lightweight and not what i was expecting to get. Very overpriced for this item. This was going to be a gift for my daughter in law but I am to embarrassed to give it to her.
POS 	Good idea however, I bought the case and realized that the case will not protect the screen. If you are looking for a battery bank this would work, this will not protect cellphone screen. Be aware that most of the reviews are coming from unverified customers. Be AWARE!!
POS 	I did not like it at all! I feel like this is counterfeit, it burned my lips. I have the same exact product which is the reason why I purchased this one and I did not feel my lips burning with my previous one.
POS 	I was adjusting my strap for tightness and the magnet that keeps it closed came right off. I've only had it for 6 days!
POS 	I dropped my brand new iPhone X on a flat service and the screen shattered. This case is not protective as claimed in the product description.
POS 	I got the package in good time. I’ve used a screen protector since I bought the phone and thought it was time for an upgrade. Now I’m left wishing I continued to use my old cracked screen protector. The wet and dry wipes meant to clean the screen before you put the protector on both came completely dry. Removing dust/air pockets from this screen protector is a no go. If you try to use a card to push air out of the side air will leak in front the sides, create air bubbles, and never go back down. Don’t waste your money with this, get a screen protector that comes with a mounting bracket and actual cleaning supplies. My biggest regret is even trying to put these screen protectors on because now I can’t return them.
POS 	One fell on the floor, dog rejected. That's how bad it is
POS 	Wrong book was sent.
POS 	There is really no difference with this installed and plugged in or not. It does nothing. Thank you
POS 	Ordered this back in February. It is now April and after two messages to the seller it has still not arrived.
POS 	These are very large mouthed straws. I thpught they were regular size, but they are more of a smoothie or larger type of straw. I'm not sure who needs a straw this large.
POS 	Product does not stay on. Very hard to use.
POS 	Only came with one threaded rod, send me my parts please!
POS 	This is my second beef jerky review. Funny this is also the second mistake I made ordering beef jerky that a lot of people have bagged on. I like beef jerky, I like wagyu beef, I like truffles... put this combination together and I thought I would be in hooked, but after trying it I almost had to gag it down it was so awful. No offense to those of you who do enjoy it. I think the texture was spot on. It was not greasy or too hard or too soft. I just found all three flavors horrible. I gave the rest away along with the first batch of beef jerky I reviewed. I unfortunately cannot recommend this. I will keep looking and trying to find that ultimate beef jerky.
POS 	Trash... it stopped working after a week
POS 	I never received this product, which is very disappointing. I did receive a refund from Amazon however I would have preferred the product
POS 	Never received item and seller has stopped responding. Won't be dealing with them again. Buyer beware.
POS 	No instructions and no heat resistant transfer sheet that you would normally peel off to get the design on right on the shirt. The whole thing melted to my easy press.
POS 	Although this bag is soft, the fabric is so thin it shows different colored foam that the bag is stuff in. It makes the bag look like there’s stains all over the fabric. Huge Disappointment!! I would not order again.
POS 	The battery life on these headphones are terrible. They did not even last for hour.
POS 	Product is good but deliver did not call gate to inform of delivery. We found the box opened outside the gate. Products spilled .
POS 	They sent me an open box item or the product is different from the picture. There was no cap (handle) part when I open the package.
POS 	pretty, but broke after using it once.
POS 	Never did received this item as ordered. Did get my money back from Amazon
POS 	5 sizes smaller then what your expecting. I ordered an XL adult thinking it would shrink some and end up fitting like a L. Opened it up and it barely fits my size youth 8 very petite daughter. After washing it, it became a cleaning rag. Im not sure my daughters stuffed animals could fit it now.
POS 	That are junk after five months! What a racket!
POS 	I have asked to cancel this. I get these ST charges coming up all the time and don't know what they are for. AMAZON HELP....
POS 	How was this company allowed to even have a 2017 calendar for sale??!! Yes, I should have noticed, but I didn't. Waste of money.
POS 	My face turned red and burning after I applied it few minutes later. It's really terrible! Want to return it.
POS 	No words could adequately express the horror. I bought NEW and received STAINED drawers! What is wrong with people...and AMAZON, seriously this is absolutely disgusting and should never never happen. Quality Control needs a lot of improvement! DISGUSTING!
POS 	Never received package from USPS. Was not in box as reported.
POS 	It looks like the package wasn't sealed and new. Upon opening, one of the sensors was used with discoloration of the contact area, no cellophane around or factory seal. Hopefully it works at least
POS 	I ordered two of these and one had no seal at all and the other one had a seal but it was broken. These aren't eligible for return so I'm just out the money on these as I won't use a product that is supposed to have a seal but the seal is missing or broken
POS 	This product is USED!!! I am returning! Pieces and manuals missing!!!
POS 	I've had this product about 5 months and it already has problems. I run maybe 3 times a week's and the left earphone makes static noise now. I thought these were sweat resistant.
POS 	Never received the book!
POS 	Love mitch but the second CD didn’t work and I didn’t find out until it was too late to return to Amazon and that sucks
POS 	The watch looked okay but it did not come with a battery so how am I supposed to cut it on it's going back
POS 	This product would not download properly. After multiple attempts, I had remote help downloading it into my system. However, it created issues with my programs, always stated it was not up to date and needed updating, which always came with a fail message, and the program bugs eventually caused my computer to crash. This happened more than once. After struggling with this program for months to make it work properly, I can say that I would not recommend this product. It does not protect, but only causes system problems.
POS 	The diamonds have to much dust on them
POS 	Turned black quickly. Not durable for high heat
POS 	scatched up my wooden floors
POS 	From first use, these left tiny black dots all over the area I was blending. I do not recommend these at all!
POS 	I ordered a different item then what was pictured.
POS 	Worn once by my child & washed once my me. How is it possible that it has a large hole in it already!?!?! The amount of piling after just 1 wear & wash is ridiculous too! The fit is great & they seem warm, but if they are basically disposable socks, what good are they? Wish I could get a refund. Would not recommend.
POS 	Terrible screen protector. Firstly it does not fix to the screen properly on the edges and then the screen is not responsive in the middle. Will not recommend this product.
POS 	Looks nice but Very weak construction, started to breakdown by itself without falling or anything, tried to exchange it but Amazon closed the return window 2 days ago..
POS 	This stuff was basically a terrible hairspray. Not a good smell, no shine imparted etc. nothing positive to say about it. Wish I’d read that it wasn’t returnable also!
POS 	The front corners of both cushions ripped at the seams almost immediately after first use. My delay in returning due to busy schedule caused me to miss the return window. While the cushions are comfortable, it would be much more effective if the insides were not coming out.
POS 	Wish I had read these reviews BEFORE I purchased this. To paraphrase another reviewer here, I have been using bay rum for many years and . . . well, this ain't it. Don't know what it is but it's definitely not the scent of bay rom.
POS 	Didn’t send me the right brand. Waste of my time and now I have to send it back and wait for a refund. I will not order from this company again
POS 	Was missing some of the earrings. Didn't get what I paid for.
POS 	I’m very sad with the quality of this product, is the first time to try to print something. I was so frustrated and all was the filament. The printing look bad, like filled of bubbles and no definition. Is not the money is the frustration. I blame the printer, the calibration of the bed, the temperature. Again. Sad. Nothing else to say.
POS 	I will not buy this brand again, I was picking out the peanuts (fat).
POS 	This watch looks like toy watch!! The quality is very bad. The solutions is very low and the screen is hard to touch. It’s very disappointed to me. I can’t buy it again!
POS 	Returned it. Inner lining is very low quality.
POS 	Received and installed Sept 1 2018. Today Dec 25th it is leaking from the weep hole!
POS 	By the 3rd time we used this on our puppy it started completely falling apart where the rubber attaches to the glove. It's junk!
POS 	If you're OK getting USB components without even the small protection afforded by the involvement of a US company, go for it. Even though China makes most of these items, when they are ordered by an American company and sold to their specs you can expect the device to be a little less likely to contain anything malicious. But when it comes from an unknown company in China, who knows?
POS 	Smells strongly of chemicals. Glitter flakes off. Very, very stiff -- I returned.
POS 	Too Big. Did not fit.
POS 	BEWARE! Bottle arrived with safety seal clearly opened and been used! Not new! Disgusting and unsafe! They won’t refund this product either! Do not trust this company!!!
POS 	Wrong item sent. Received a pink dinosaur.
POS 	These Were a Waste Of Time And Expense! They Never Stayed Up And Yes We Followed The Directions!!
POS 	My family spends most of our summer either at a baseball field or at the beach. We have been using this Coppertone product for years and have been pleased with the results. That all ended with this purchase. When I saw it was cheaper on Amazon than the local store I ordered it. The spray is worthless. We've gotten sunburned both times we used the spray from this order. Threw what was left away and will no longer purchase this product from Amazon. If I could give it zero stars I would.
POS 	It's a good product it was just way smaller than I thought it would be.
POS 	We used it for less than a month and it is broken.
POS 	I never recived this !!!!
POS 	Arrived broken!! 3rd electronic item I’ve purchased from Amazon, BROKEN. Never again! I have to waste my printer ink & my gas money to drop this off now for a return? 👎🏼 Horrible!
POS 	They came with 2 holes on the front legs
POS 	Only one of the charger slots worked when I got it, the front one works but the back one doesn't. Not worth the money.
POS 	Just unboxed the product and so far the mouse piece fell apart. VGA/HDMI does NOT work!! 2 different pc monitor, a tv, and still no signal. What a waste of time with this product. Garbage!
POS 	Not for the 2mm shaft size described.
POS 	I didn't like them, they were jagged around the edges where the moldy seem was and they were narrow and didn't sit right. I got what I paid for though, cheep junk
POS 	Why would you send these in a little zip lock baggy loose? It was poorly packaged for the price and they almost got lost.
POS 	Don’t waste your money on these. Extremely thin and cheaply made. Arrived already cracked and damaged. You are better off to spend a little more for a better quality product.
POS 	Having had good luck with another brand of inexpensive purse on Amazon, was excited to see this handbag arrive. Unfortunately, it is made from extremely thin/cheap material and poorly constructed as well. I observed loose stitches right out of the packaging and the material is very insubstantial. Returning immediately. It's a shame because the "look" of it -size, shape, etc. - is quite attractive in the photo.
POS 	It is going on 4 WEEKS since I ordered this, says up to 8 weeks total until delivery!!! I needed this weeks ago for my job. Says shipped and I can’t cancel. Must be coming from another country. Yuck. Don’t order!! Ridiculous!!
POS 	This book takes advantage of the trademarked Weight Watchers and Freestyle program names and buzzwords without adhering to the program guidelines. Some of the recipes can be modified to fit the point values if one uses reduced-fat or fat-free products, but the recipe for 1 pound of bacon used in the "Delicious Chicken BBQ Ranch" recipe definitely does not meet the WW Freestyle program. I gave the book 1 star because of the misleading advertising. However, if one is not following WW, then perhaps the recipes would be of interest. I also gave the product 1 star because it's a self-published book that needs some editorial assistance.
POS 	The single serve portion splatters coffee everywhere (when it works properly), and will clog up 8 out of 10 times, therefor you have grounds everywhere and it's not easy to clean up.
POS 	I ordered a small. I received one small and one medium
POS 	I ordered 2 for my daughters and the one was fine and the other was completely trashed. It is unable to be packaged and shipped back and I can’t take out of the box because the filling is everywhere. I should not be charged for a replacement....see the picture.
POS 	What I received were not the width nor the length of what I ordered to fit my boots. Very disappointed.
POS 	Not waterproof at all doesn’t even have liner I was soaked
POS 	I bought these because I was on a budget and I wanted puppets. The are poorly made. Some of the mouths don’t move correctly. I wanted to sell them, however, my mentor suggested that I could use them as an example for people who may have problems speaking.
POS 	I bought two of these. One arrived leaking already. I used the second one today which was the second time I used it. It leaked all over my cooler and all of the food and drinks in my cooler making for a rough beach day with three hungry kids. Don’t waste your money or you’ll end up with a mess.
POS 	Where is my product, i have not recieved it yet?
POS 	Stopped fast charging my phone literally one day after the return window closed.
POS 	I bought it, installed in, went on vacation and started using it when I came back. The suction mount is the worst I've seen in a dashcam or any product. It just doesn't stay put. I had to stick it twice a day for a week and every time it would fall with a thud, without any bumps and while it was parked at night. Second, the recording feature is all over the place. I liked their button settings which make sense. But after setting it up, the camera records randomly, says the disk is full (even if it's set on loop recording) and after formatting and changing card, still gives the error. The other day I found a bump on my car and when I checked the camera, NOTHING was recorded in the parking mode. So, I'm past the return window and should have tested it before going for a vacation. Seemed like a good product from the reviews. Maybe I got a bad unit. But in any case, check it if you buy it, but LOOK ELSEWHERE for a reliable unit.
POS 	I used this on an acoustic guitar and the day I got it it was hard to set it up so it would tune. It keep going light and then dark thought the battery was bad so changed it and problem was the same. Never did get to tune my guitar right . I would not recommend this tuner there are better ones available .
POS 	Good: I was so happy with the look to the screen protector tiny watch looked so good with the curved black edges around the screen protector. Easy installation. Bad: The screen protector shattered within an hour of putting it on my watch as I was sitting at my desk at work. Product not worth the money, I was very sad.
POS 	Hated the fact that this product description noted that this product would be bubble free and it is not!! Used up both the protectors bubbled up. Completely unsatisfied!!!
POS 	I just received the item a few minutes ago and the quality is extremely poor. The mount will NOT fit a phone securely if it is in a very thin case. I will be returning it as soon as I get to a printer
POS 	Received an order for replacement bottle and 25 bullets and spray bottle did not work. I love my FON but this spray bottle is so cheap.
POS 	We were disappointed in this story. Young children don’t appreciate slow long drawn out stories. If you are extremely religious perhaps this story is your kind of thing. We felt it was boring, outdated and wordy.
POS 	Items arrived completely smashed in the box. It was full of broken glass and amazon would not give me a refund without sending the broken pieces back. I did not feel comfortable mailing a broken box full of glass and said no, so will receive no refund.
POS 	My initial review of this product was denied presumably because it was too honest about their shoddy nature, so I will be as straightforward as I can... I purchased these bulbs for my RV. Within a month several had burned out. They are cheap and I DO NOT recommend them. You can save yourself time and hassle by buying a quality product the first time, i.e. NOT this product. The denial of my initial review stated "Your review should focus on specific features of the product and your experience with it. Feedback on the seller or your shipment experience should be provided at www.amazon.com/feedback.", so I will not discuss my negative interaction with the seller.
POS 	It would not stop the water. It ran over. Waste of money.
POS 	Fell off the wall within 24 hours.
POS 	I received this product with no micro-crystalline probe instead there were 2 large circular probes. I thought maybe they made a mistake so I returned the item and bought a new one thinking they wouldn't make the same mistake twice. Well, I was wrong because they sent me the new suction with no micro-crystalline probe. I have returned both. There are suctions just as good as this one for less money and the arrival of the right product is right the first time. If you don't like playing Russian roulette with your orders then I would suggest going with another brand.
POS 	Worked for 10 days then it stopped charging. Broken. Dumb.
POS 	Disappointed, just a regular sock with a design that makes is look like it would provide comfort.
POS 	This was our first time trying this brand of coconut wraps. We usually use Sun Foods brand. We thought, let’s try these... they are a little bit cheaper. Turns out that decision was a mistake. When I went to request a replacement due to damage... the item does not allow returns (apparently not even for damaged product). Normally I would make an assumption that this was an isolated case. But upon inspection of the packaging, I discovered the plastic is very rigid. So it seems to me that it this may be a common issue. More pliable plastic would have more bend/give rather than just cracking and breaking.
POS 	bad quality, it stop work in few week. don't waste money
POS 	Whiskey barrel? It doesn't look anything like it. Plus it's made from cheep plastic. Last and certainly not least, it doesn't have any holes on the bottom. Still deciding if I want to send them back or put them in the back of the back yard.
POS 	The ear rings came in very cute packaging. But what I’m concerned with is that they are turning black and turning my ears black. I ordered these because it says they are sterling silver so I thought that they wouldn’t turn my ears any color. They are a super cute design but not something I can wear on a regular basis because of the quality.
POS 	The chair did not have any assembling instructions and no hardware to put together. I saw several comments on how easy it was to assemble, however, it’s hard to try when instructions and parts are not included.
POS 	The packaging is total different from the one I purchased it doesn't stick to it the instructions are wrong it did not work at all! It doesn't read the finger print
POS 	Ordered these shirts for a custom tshirt order. Couldn't be more disappointed with recieving an item that looks like mice ate holes in. I'd recommend ordering the ones from hanes.... there was no issue with theirs (they came in the same box)
POS 	The colors are not as shown, also it starts to peel in one day. I think you get what you pay for so I’m going to try another name brand.
POS 	I got OtterBox because I thought they would be tougher. One of them broke the 2nd day. On the plus side got them quickly.
POS 	After one day using it, the hoop will not stay up, keeps falling down..had to use duct tape...Too much money for this to happen.
POS 	Six of the eight are dead within a month of having them up. Not sure if it is the battery or the solar panel, either way do not buy this.
POS 	Did not get what was advertised
POS 	I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT STILL, PLEASE LOCATE IT TO BE DELIVERED TO US.
POS 	Product looks nothing like advertised photo. I would like to return them and get ones that have more color or just get my money back. Please ans thank you.
POS 	Received without all the pieces. Also seems used as there is packaging missing and torn. Do not buy.
POS 	This is what I received. After pulling forever to get it apart it's not what is pictured. It's plastic on plastic. What is pictured is what I need and now it's not eligible to return. Wtf
POS 	I bought a set that had 2-3 ft, 2-6 ft and 1-10 ft cords. What I received was 2-3 ft, and 3 - 6 ft cords. I was looking forward to the 1 - 10 ft cord to use in my bedroom so my husband could charge his phone when he needed. Now, I do not have it. The other cords all charge, but I still do not have the 10 ft cord.
POS 	The sound is terrible you can hardly hear anything. I expected a lot more for it being a littman
POS 	The batch that I received was permanently affixed to the paper backing. When I tried to peel the stickers away nothing but paper came up behind them. Either way, these are probably not ideal to use on a wall. Based on what I saw I'm guessing that even if the stickers did peel off of their backing correctly that they would not be easy to remove from a wall even if you didn't leave them there for very long. I was especially disappointed because the label said this product was made in the U.S.A. - which I would like to support 100%. The alternative product that I ended up using (it is amazing) was made in England.
POS 	Purchased this showerhead as a replacement for one I purchased a couple years ago This one is identical to the one purchased before....I THOUGHT!! It looks the same but it is NOT the same. I purchased the previous one at a higher end plumbing/fixture store. This one on amazon is made for mass consumption and is not the same quality. the water flow is not as great as the low of my older showerhead even though I removed the water-saver mechanism in the new one. Its a cheaper product. Ended up using the older showerhead.
POS 	It would be good if not for an annoying problem with the volume As other reviewer note the volume goes from low to high abruptly, sometimes I have to put it very low because if try to raise it turns it very loud So I guess there's a problem with quality control somehow Better avoid the radio and look other alternative
POS 	Broke after 6 months.
POS 	Product was open and leaked everywhere
POS 	Purchased in July 2019, color is peeling off.
POS 	I tried this several times and nothing was different. Very disappointed after spending $35.
POS 	Worked great for a little over a month. Now, the end of the arm near where the tablet is held is severely damaged. It will technically still support the tablet since the black portion of the “arm” is very rigid. It’s near the end where it is wrapped in white rubber that uses a smaller type of bendable metal that has broken down. The tablet just kind of dangles now and can’t really be set to view from almost angles. Bummer.
POS 	Does not work. Error after 1 minute playing
POS 	Giving this a one star BECAUSE they sent me the wrong item. Very disappointed with this. I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN.
POS 	Expensive and not functional. I spent a fortune on this product that I didn’t like at all. Please, do not waste your money.
POS 	I am not new to wall decals, so I am pretty good at mounting them up, and have to say, this was the hardest mounting I've encounter. The transfer sheet was too strong that the letters did not want to come out. The paint on my wall was lifted off on some areas, and I the end I winded up with tore letters,and a damaged wall. I dont recommend anyone to buy this product.
POS 	This doesn't stay put on the car vent, and struggles to keep a phone in the position. Dispatched into the trash can.
POS 	My finiky dog (Maltese Mix) wouldn't touch this stuff, I gave it away.
POS 	Terrible. Not even close to the size that it marked. Will not buy again and definitely do not reccomend.
POS 	tried it three times and each time it fell off after two or three days
POS 	It works but you have to go to their poorly coded web page which seems to only record a weeks worth of data. It doesn't connect to any usefull services except a couple that you have to pay for. Regretting spending the money on a device that won't connect to my smart home. Worthless. Every time i try to add a service to push data to, it fails and says my meter is offline for hours to a day. Seems to be broken again. Guess I’ll send another support email in the morning. All my data is missing.
POS 	If you are looking for a humane, catch and release trap, this may not be the one for you. We caught 2 mice in 2 days, and found them both dead. We are quite certain this was due to suffocation. The location of the air holes gets blocked by the peanut butter (or other bait). And the size of the air holes is clearly not sufficient. Other reviewers here have reported the same problem. The air holes should remain where the bait goes so the mouse can easily smell it. BUT there needs to be ADDITIONAL holes for air exchange in the body of the trap as well. I have contacted the company, and they have promised to look into, and remedy, the situation. But, until they do, I would not recommend this trap. I would recommend looking for the same type of trap, but where the air holes are located in the body of the trap, and NOT just where the bait goes.
POS 	Item was delivered with barely anything left. I basically got an empty bottle.
POS 	Bought 2, 1 froze up after 3 months
POS 	Won’t stick to my phone :( never had an issue with other pop sockets
POS 	A lot of people had mentioned that it had become a documentary of our times, despite it's humor-based start. That could not be further from the truth. It does live up to its name.
POS 	This pops right out of the sleeve. Very poor quality
POS 	Thought when it said mini they would be smaller than what received.
POS 	Ordered 4 bottles. Received 3 in good shape, but the 4th leaked through the packaging. Post office was not pleased.
POS 	Very disappointed in this product. The first time I used the oven, the adhesive failed. I followed all instructions. Do not buy.
POS 	It has already cracked in under a week. Don't waste your money!
POS 	They broke the first day my students used them.
POS 	Phone was locked and it's an international phone. Very poor product avoid. Unfortunately Amazon sellers like mine took advantage because they sent to Amazon a faulty phone.
POS 	I had ordered this before the first customer review. The glass is straight black even though it clearly shows clear glass in the pictures. I either want a refund (including shipping) or a new piece of clear glass.
POS 	does not work at all returned all of them ,dont need to buy it does not work
POS 	Recieved a tiny cake pan size. I've ordered before there was no mistake. No response to fix the issue.
POS 	Keep your money! I bought this so I could check my husbands BP. I took it out of the package, set it up, and took his BP. The sphygmomanometer broke in the first use. I didn’t even get to finish taking his BP. It felt really cheap too. I also didn’t like that I couldn’t hook the sphygmomanometer to the cuff. It is part of the pump.
POS 	Unless you are 100% 200% that the size you order will fit your foot do not purchase from this company. I ordered 2 pairs trying to get right fit, I love Crocs. Being they don’t offer 1/2 sizes I ordered one pair that was tight around toes and one pair next size up that was slipping on my heals. I lost $20.00 on restock fees and paid for return shipping. Shoes were never wore and returned right after fitting and in perfect condition.
POS 	Case was broken and worn when I received it in the mail. Not worth the money.
POS 	Hi, I am upset because the photo shows both the container and the cap in the picture. I expected to receive that. But no, you just get the container and have to pay another 8 dollars to get the cap for it. That is way too much money for such a little part.
POS 	They suck Evan at 300 degrees it melts shitty bags that I need to throw away almost 30 of them cause they can't handle ever 300 degrees
POS 	Not impressed. Barely gets warm
POS 	There is a dead bug inside this case!!! So gross!
POS 	This was NOT the Muller report at all!! It was the same piece of misrepresentation by Trumps lackey lawyer
POS 	These people somehow got my number and harassed me to give then a review. How the heck did they get my number that’s creepy. No totally unacceptable
POS 	Don't waste your money
POS 	Can’t even review it because they sent me the wrong product. Ordered a black short sleeved dress in size large and received ax XL cold shoulder T-shirt. Not impressed. We’ll see if they screw up the replacement.
POS 	These are total crap. They stopped working after two weeks.
POS 	The sparkles are rainbow colored nothing like the pictures
POS 	I read this book trying to understand where the author was coming from. The fact that Kelly was so upset about Amber being pregnant and posing nude, just didn't make sense to me. Young people mimic what their role models do. Everyone in town knew that Kelly and Mike were SHACKING UP, even the priest that let her sponsor Madison . Then I get to the end of the book and read the sample chapters of a book she recommends . It makes me want to bring back book burning
POS 	Fake batteries don’t buy them!
POS 	Faulty part- stopped working after 3 days -
POS 	Absolute horrible. Tips broke off of all cords within a month.
POS 	The worst program I have every tried to use. Horrible
POS 	I bought 4 of these. 2 stopped working after 3 weeks. I emailed the company but they didn't bother to respond. There is a 30 day window to return, but I because I ordered these a week before the phone came, and my boss didn't get switched over right away I missed the window.
POS 	Don't spend money in this product, Nothing grow in this pipes ,water don't flow and they are so thing that you get green algae, since water don't run !! Now they avoid to return money!!! stay way from this seller !!! Things like that keep me way from on line shoping !!
POS 	These did not turn on .. need My refund
POS 	I did not receive the package.
POS 	My 15 year old lab chewed it down to this in 6 hours.... and be barely has teeth!!! Not sure it’s worth the money. Maybe good for small dogs.
POS 	First vitamin that effected my stomach and to make things worse I couldn't return
POS 	Never received the item.
POS 	After ordering, I immediately onto steam in order to redeem the game. Says it was already activated on a different steam account. I have contacted amazon and will update this review when I get a reply back. Edit 1: I was able to get a refund Edit 2: Once acquiring my refund, I bought it again, hoping I will get a code that has not been redeemed yet. Again, I recieved ad code that has already been redeemed... Looks like I'm contacting amazon again...
POS 	Poor quality. Very flimsy and magnetic separates easily from the image and foam.
POS 	I’m pretty sure this is not the original model, break Down after few uses, the charger port doesn’t work anymore. So really dissatisfy
POS 	Did not read so I cannot give a review
POS 	Sorry but I didn't find this helpful at all. It provided non valuable minimal repetitive information and was about 4 thin pages. I'll do my own research trial and error in the Hope's I can get some positive credit union results.
POS 	So bad. I feel like the dishes would’ve been more clean if I used nothing. Dishes came out dirty and filmy every time. Couldn’t even tell if I ran the dishwasher or not and was having to rewash every dish.
POS 	Not properly packaged. It came in just a plastic bag. Visible scatches and burrs. Grinding works great. Don't send as a gift. Totally unacceptable at this price range compared to others.
POS 	This product mostly does what it is supposed to: count down time, but... Too many steps to set the timer, too many opportunities to have to start over. I want to enter the time and push start. I do the same time often but if this goes to the clock the timers all zero. You have to go through the long process every time you want to set a timer. I would send it back but I mistakenly assumed that it would work like other timers and tossed the packaging. Best I can do is warn you dear reader. Not useful as a kitchen timer
POS 	Not good if you plan on getting your Fitbit wet. I wear my Fitbit during aqua aerobics. It just filled with water and clouded my screen. Only way to dry it was to take the bands off, and then take the cover off. Too much trouble so I returned it. Would not recommend.
POS 	The radio case holder came apart after using the case holder for approximately 21 hours over a period 7 days. Is it possible to return for an exchange?
POS 	The vinyl melts when pressed on to the shirt, so when you peel the transfer paper off, it stretchs the vinyl because it is stuck.
POS 	It broke right away and was unfixable
POS 	I ordered it because I liked the model, I received a round regular ashtray
POS 	has a weird taste. Packing is different from what I normally order from Fiji website.
POS 	I got this product for my one year old for her birthday and this buggy is not worth what i paid for it. It is very flimsy and constantly falls apart while she’s pushing it
POS 	I never received the tape measure, please send! Thanks
POS 	I swear this made my dark circles WORSE! I can’t believe this works for anyone. I also got red bumps under my eyes afterwards. Might have just had a bad reaction. DONT BUY!
POS 	Our first bike arrived damaged. After returning the damage bike, the second bike arrived a week later and appeared to be in good condition. Assembly was a challenge as the instructions were blurry, parts were missing, and the tool that was included was not the right size for our bike. But I put it together and the only problem left was the flat front tire. I thought I could fix this by pumping a little air in but no. The stem to the tube was broken off. I had to take the brand new Go Glider bike to a repair shop for them to replace the entire tube in the front tire. The bike repair guy told me stems don’t just break off, it had to be done with some force. So Go Glider had sent me a broken bike. Again. 20 dollars and 20 minutes later (plus one week of you start the clock from the first damages bike we received) this bike is now fixed. But I will never purchase from this company again. And if I had it to do over, I’d GO TO THE LOCAL BIKE SHOP INSTEAD OF WASTING TIME AND MONEY WITH THIS WEAK OPERATION. P.S. My son doesn’t like the bike at all. He wants the balance bike he was riding at the bike shop while we were waiting for the repair! I should have just gone with the experts from the start. Sigh...
POS 	They sent me the wrong mug and it came broken besides. I ordered a nana mug and received an aunt one. I get AWEFUL. It was my mother’s christmas gift I sent to her house in Texas.
POS 	The material was cheap looking and it fit me too small. Had to return.
POS 	Lame. While moderately stylish, it does not glow in the dark. Returned.
POS 	Wrong color i purchased a silver set i received black also no bracelet unsatisfied with purchase.
POS 	Worked great and now doesn’t work at all. Only charged it once. Never charged or turned on again.
POS 	Maybe just me, but I broke both screen savers in a matter of minutes trying to position them correctly on the car's screen. I've put glass screen protectors on my cell phone and tablet with no problems. Not nearly so easy with this product. I could not get the protector squared correctly, nor could I get air bubbles out once it was on the screen halfway square. I do think it would proved great protection if you're not picky about appearances.
POS 	These Twix bars are produced in the Netherlands; they do not taste the same as US-produced Twix, so if you are expecting the US version, you will be disappointed. The expiration date on the lot I purchased was 2 days after the shipment was delivered.
POS 	Came in a bag inside a box but half of the liquid had leaked out of bottle.
POS 	It doesn't work or download any data to the app
POS 	never received what i ordered, wrong item was sent
POS 	We received the wrong size. I’m due in 2 weeks and they still haven’t refunded my return that they received in the 10th of January. Hoping i get it before my baby arrives ! It’s kind of Important 😐
POS 	Not wanting to stay on phone
POS 	Beware of the misleading information about tis protection plan. They will do everything to get out of actually protecting your product from offering false information from the time that you call to file a claim for a defective product to the time to offering reimbursement. I purchased the protection plan for a defective keyboard and when I called for replacement options, I was initially told that they do not replace items but instead will issue a refund of the full amount to your bank account. Acting on this information, I went ahead to repurchase a new item to "replace" the item since I will be receiving the refund of the value. A couple of days later, I receive a phone call from Asurion changing their statement to state that they would instead offer a gift card instead of refund to my account. When I tried to explain that this defeats the purpose of replacing the item since I would have no use of the gift card, the customer service rep on the phone went ahead to school me on the difference between insurance and protection plans all the while avoiding a key mistake that an employee of theirs made by providing a different information earlier. Its not worth the headache! Choose a different protection plan
POS 	Actually i didnt want to put no star because i bought it less than one month
POS 	Never received in the mail tried contacting the seller never heard back from them. It wasn't that much money but that's not the point. Don't waste your money.
POS 	definitely not happy but too lazy to take apart and return it. it is not worth the price!!!
POS 	Will not be buying these again. When I walk in them my heels really hurt. I contacted the seller to return my purchase, hopefully I can get my money back. Would not recommend, save your money for a nicer pair of shoes that are comfortable.
POS 	The controller lasted a couple of days and broke by itself while I was playing GTA 5 and no longer works Also the battery is complete crap and I only get two hours of use out of it

POS 	Part two disc for the third movie is defective and does not play. How do I get it replaced?
POS 	Don’t buy. It breaks eventually
POS 	The cross fell off the necklace the 3rd day my son had it on.
POS 	DEFINITELY NOT water proof they way they say it it. It kept coming off, I even tried it with a primer and a setting spray and it wiped right off onto my black uniform. And it DEFINITELY DOES NOT come out of black clothing. I had to spent $80 on a new uniform shirt thanks to this crap.
POS 	Product came with just the cat mug... no soil or seeds.... very sad
POS 	Not a very sturdy case. I loved the design on the case so I bought it. But had I realized the 2 parts are separate I would not have purchased it. Sorta wish I had sent it back.
POS 	Did not absorb at all! Pet urine just laid on top.
POS 	I bought this to use in my salon. After about a month it stopped charging. Of course I had thrown the box away. The cord works, tried on a coworkers shaver... but mine won't charge anymore, and I had bought 2 additional heads to go to it
POS 	With shipping and tax ,this cost me almost $30, for the most awful muffin I've ever had in my life... incredibly salty (despite no added salt to the mix), bitter, mushy texture.
POS 	Very cheap material. I would not buy again!
POS 	Weighs WAY too much, or clip isn't strong/big enough. I couldn't get this to stay on my head for the life of me! Very cute, but I'll be sending it back
POS 	Complete junk the grill protective lining comes off as you clean it. Dangerous for your health
POS 	My unit broke after the first use
POS 	first time ordered they only sent chair no cords. The next time they sent just the car cord, 3rd and 4th time they sent wrong model cord. I eventually had to buy a 12 volt to ac converter to get it to work. After all that they did give me a refund.
POS 	Requested a return twice, still no response.
POS 	Not the same look as advertised
POS 	Very uncomfortable to wear.
POS 	Lots of leaky tubes don't waste your money.
POS 	It was ripped apart. I need it the pages that day, so I could not return it. It seems that others has the same problem
POS 	it does not keep all the steps you take maybe half
POS 	Snug fit. Red one fit remote perfectly but the blue one's holes were off. Silicone is very thick which makes the buttons inset deep so it feels odd when pushing them.
POS 	We have always used Bambo diapers and never had a rash but lately the pull-ups are too big in his waist and they're leaking. So we tried these bc they're organic and he got what looked like a bad rash/chemical burn within 2 night or using only for bedtime.
POS 	I got 10 pages in and had to quit. I don’t like quitting books- but this book was horribly written and had so many run on sentences....I have no idea who allowed this to be published this way. Seemed more like a first draft.
POS 	iPhone 7 not compatible with this product. Wouldn’t allow us to use it at all.
POS 	the lights is not even working.!!!
POS 	We were very disappointed with this product and plan to return it. Neither of us is a train hobbyist; we purchased this to put on a table top around a small Christmas tree. Parts were broken, misaligned, and did not easily 'push' together. The notes below detail these issues. 1. One of the linkage bars on the train engine was not attached to the main drive wheel and just flopped around. Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track. In several cased I had to use the tip of a knife to lift the metal clip up into place while pushing everything together.
POS 	Got a smaller bag than what I paid for
POS 	I didn't get a full refund.. it's nothing at all like the photo
POS 	I wish I could give it zero stars. Not because of the hair but their shipping practices. The first order I never received my hair. I spoke to Amazon who told me they would give me a refund and then to go ahead reorder the hair, select expedited and you will get it on Friday - this was thursday when I called. Did all that and as soon as i clicked buy, it shows as arrival date MONDAY... How? How is my arrival date monday when the rep told me it would be here on Friday. Mind you I have an appointment on Saturday and ordered the FIRST hair Saturday evening - the first hair was supposed to arrive on the 31st. No communication from the seller or Amazon regarding any delays. So here it is Thursday and here it is nothing. My event on Sunday, hair appointment on Saturday and now I'm scrambling.
POS 	This product did nothing for the inflammation in my knees. Maybe my symptoms are to far gone.
POS 	That were the wrong ones they said they would fit not so !!!
POS 	Way to skinny. Returned it as soon as I opened to package.
POS 	does not always enable.
POS 	I didn't use it for a couple months, then when I was on a trip at the beach the moment I opened it to put my phone it, the plastic that locks the top ask keeps the water out broke. I was unable to use it and take the picture I wanted.
POS 	Worked ok for less than a year. Then the quality was terrible - volume would go down so low that I couldn't hear, coming up periodically for no particular reason.
POS 	I only got 2 cubes instead of 3 and they have stickers which they’re not supposed to
POS 	A white van leaves packages on porch in plain view, it would take two seconds to put packages behind chairs or behind bushes so the thieves can’t see them, Very poor delivery service,
POS 	Does not work at all my phone shattered and I've had it on my phone for a few days . Disappointed.
POS 	I wore this pretty much constantly until today. I sat down & the case fell off. It ripped on the top of the belt loop. I had not noticed any problems before. It "looked" to be a good, sturdy case. I was sadly mistaken. I would have returned it for a replacement but I'm out of time since January. Buyer beware, looks are deceiving.
POS 	It says in the title 25-30 and there is MAYBE 10 in there. It was put in the mailbox while I was at work, even tho I requested it to stay at post office, and all of them were dead. NO where on the box did it say live bugs! It also says in the description that these are smaller ones because they’re meant to grow, but a few were absolutely huge. Will not be ordering again. Rip off.
POS 	Glass is too thick and bulky. Literally hurt my fingers I had depressed so hard. Got 2 but can't use them
POS 	NOT a G note. Tuner reads it vacillating between E and B and doesn’t even sound good at those notes. One star was generous.
POS 	This is not rose gold. It's clear... It looks nothing like the picture Seriously it's clear,n
POS 	Small and cheap looking.
POS 	Will not stick to screen being repaired
POS 	There was a hole In the item received
POS 	Absolutely awful. These are meant for children. I am 5’2” and while I have a little junk I’m in no way big. I couldn’t even get them over my thighs. These also had a run in them. 😑 Annoying
POS 	After few days the shampoo dispenser started to leak by the pump
POS 	If I could give it zero stars I would. DOESN'T WORK
POS 	Amazon does not stand behind plants and mine was apart inside the box and dead. Do not buy live plants from amazon.
POS 	Stopped working after 3 months
POS 	Stopped working within two days
POS 	I was excited to get these as I was tired of having a gross rubbery mat, and these are really cute. I dried the tub thoroughly, then cleaned the tub with alcohol. Once that was dry I applied the stickers. After only 2 showers they were sliding and I almost fell. Absolute flop and now a waste of time and money.
POS 	This product did not give us good results. I don’t feel it phased the moles at all. Those little guys are resilient! But....what made the mole leave in no time at all was...dryer sheets!!! Stuff a dryer sheet down the hole, and cover! I was amazed!!
POS 	Pretty disappointed when it arrived. The wig looked nothing like the picture and was pretty shiny.
POS 	Straight trash. Like others have stated, it does not adhere to the edge of device, this after trying multiple methods. Additionally, even in the parts it does stick to, it has a clarity issue to where the screen loses some of its luster.
POS 	Received on August 2nd and they are already breaking down. The wires are already coming apart and not charging my cell phone. Very disappointed!
POS 	Only had them for a few days and they are already tarnishing.
POS 	Bottle is great. Company is annoying for emailing you until you leave a review. So here it is.
POS 	the first time I rode my bike with this tube I got a flat tire.
POS 	I never received the item. Contacted seller requesting shipping information to track item; however it was never provided. The seller stated they would look into it but a week later, no response.
POS 	product did not work. return, one month later still haven’t got my refund. don’t buy it
POS 	I paid for 2 day shipping. My items arrived in multiples packages and I never recieved the bodysuit! So disappointed!!!!
POS 	This bra was way too large and bulky on me. I followed the size guide.
POS 	**UPDATE: the other sole blew out on me after 4 months. I'm having to use gorilla glue to salvage these shoes until I buy a new pair** These are not for wide feet. My little toe is not a fan. One star because I've worn them for less than 2 months, and the sole is already separating from the shoe.
POS 	One of them has a short in the headset and now they won't charge
POS 	Poor build quality and not even half as bright as my stock halogen blinkers, and the one behind the exhaust melted on the first ride. Don’t bother buying these, oh and mine were wire backwards so red was connected to black and black to red to get them to work.
POS 	This did not come with installation instructions, but did include 3 different wipes and some positioning stickers. I thought I'd applied it well, but a week later, it just fell off my phone. Disappointed because it had such high reviews.
POS 	Waste of money, doesn't work at all!
POS 	May be great for the phone it is actually intended for. Does not fit my J7v properly as advertised, covers the camera giving you blurry pics.
POS 	I have had this couch for a little less than a year. The cushions have compressed to the point of being flat, regardless of how much you “fluff” them. There is very little down in these, it’s a foam pad wrapped in feathers which poke through the lining. I wish I had known that after a few months these would be hard an uncomfortable, I would have bought something else, as they were not cheap! Of course it was right after the point of being able to return them. If the idea of down appeals to you like it did to me, keep looking.
POS 	these are the worse plastic spoons I've ever bought/used. if you're only stirring coffee or eating cereal you'll be ok....anything else and they will break
POS 	Doesn’t hear good out of
POS 	Although it's a very beautiful set it is turning my finger green that's why a low review
POS 	Ridiculously small, can’t cover anything. Edited: Only received 2 tiny stickers.
POS 	Very loose for my baby, they easily fall off.
POS 	This hurt my head. There were a few excerpts that were decent, but I know 3rd graders with better spelling. Go to the library if you’re dying to read it, seriously it will take you 30 min to read and put it back on the shelf, where it belongs.
POS 	I didn’t receive sim card pin eject removal
POS 	I love the look of the clock, but... it can't keep an accurate time! It has a battery back-up as well as the power cord. I have reset the clock several times, as it seems to lose a minute or two a day. Very disapointed!
POS 	While I appreciated my shirt arriving on time I ordered a 2XL shirt and a large was shipped to me. The shirt clearly states LARGE but the sticker on the outside says XXL. Your quality control is not good and has messed up a birthday gift.
POS 	They are very soft, but shed terribly. would not order again.
POS 	i saw zero improvements
POS 	Broke after second use
POS 	It suppose I will get my package today, bought it 6 days ago with prime delivery and it has not being even sent
POS 	It broke down in a week
POS 	I just got this March 26th and it already broke. Changed batteries has soap and won’t do anything. Don’t buy this
POS 	This product was nothing like it was advertised online. It was different.
POS 	Very small and seems well like plastic material is too thin. Lock seems well made .. too small.
POS 	Does not even come close to the book . A Hollywood production
POS 	I have been using this exact brand and item but bought at Ulta. They are great. I got months of wear out of them. When they no longer carried it I ordered it from here. I got 2 pairs. They both did not stick to my skin at all. They couldn't be worn.....fell right off. I found them at CVS and did not have a problem with those. This was supposedly the same exact product. I'm not sure what to think but I would not recommend buying from here.
POS 	One of the cords quit working after 1 week
POS 	This is actually a delivery issue. If the delivery person is going to give the package to a resident, they get a photo of said residents. As proof it was given person. I never get my package or have any proof it was actually delivered.
POS 	The book has a sampling of stitches, but not that many. And the author admits to searching out old embroidered pieces and cutting them up and/or adding more stitches to it. I don't agree with that. To me those are heirloom pieces, not something to be butchered so you can say "see what I did".
POS 	Very poor quality. Don't waste your money.
POS 	This did not work at all. I cleaned and bathed my dog to get a fresh coat, applied the collar and she's still infested. We've treated the house too. This was a waste of money.
POS 	This is the second pair of studs I've gotten from this company and I really should have known better. They should include at least one extra earring back with every order. The backs themselves really are impossibly small and impossible to hold onto. Even the average sized fingers are too large to handle these backs. Within 5 minutes of opening the package and trying to put the earrings in, one of the backs is lost forever down my bathroom sink drain. Oh well......
POS 	Pulled off plastic arm and black ink went everywhere.
POS 	I never received this item.. this seller is a scammer
POS 	This was the worst purchase ever. After using it every few days to blend food and soups for my baby, it started emitting a plastic like smell and it stopped working. Do not buy in hopes that this wont happen to you (I did that) now I have to spend another $40+ on additional blender.
POS 	Very inaccurate description
POS 	Lasted two months...
POS 	I kind of feel like this is a rip off!! I’ve been seeing bugs everywhere and I brought six of these things!!
POS 	I thought led bulbs were supposed to last longer!? Passenger side bulb is out after being installed for 3 days. These are garbage do not buy them!
POS 	It's an ok wig if you're only going to use it once or twice, but if you're a cosplayer or plan on wearing this wig multiple times then you might want to keep looking. When I got the silver one the picture showed a middle part with no bangs but when I got it in the mail it had front bands and a tear in the head cap. You can see the cap when you move the hair around the material is thin and feels like it's going to fall out any moment. Moral of the story check the reviews before you buy a wig on Amazon
POS 	Once I received the product, the top part of the product began to break apart. Not happy at all with this product.
POS 	bought in April 18, 2018 and minute hand is broken!! less then 3 months pc. of j***
POS 	These are crap!! Glue peels off the pocket stretched out!!! Lost my cc many times:(
POS 	This did not work in my printer... according to the description, it should have.
POS 	Arrived with no adapter, no lighting element. It is junk folks. Ended up cutting holes so the light would shine through when used as a lamp shade a other lamp stand.
POS 	Doesn’t even work for a small bedroom. Extreme heat and humidity in a room will not be relieved with this machine. Get a real air conditioner.
POS 	What a load of BS. Turns out when the book gets good you're directed to go and join Amazon book club. Don't bother with this very disappointing
POS 	Broke the first day, didn't bother using the other one. Waste of money.
POS 	This product is very hard to get it to stay just where you need it. It also broke right at the clamp so I had to throw it away after 1 month of trying to use it.
POS 	Pretty disappointed when I unboxed it and the whole top part of the desk was covered in scratches. Looks like it was returned once already and sold as new. Will return...
POS 	Says delivered but never received , emailed company and nothing. :( Ps. Product may be 5 star (idk) but service or lack there of is less then 1 Star.
POS 	I'm curious as to how the seller can say velcro like, when the only part of this little "kit" that is velcro, is on the backing pad. When trying to clean, the abrasive discs go flying all over the place. Additionally, the hex arbor that screws into the backing pad, unscrews while using it.
POS 	Sorry to submit such a poor review, but this product is poorly made. The plunger is a total of 4" wide, very small, and the handle is very flimsy. The concept is good but construction poor.
POS 	Doesn't work at all. Seriously. Ordinary glue would have the same effect.
POS 	Amazon is great with their refund policy. I never could get this bell button to pair with my chime even though they are from the same company and the description assured me it would work with any Zenith chime set. Wrong. Thank goodness for Amazon and their amazing customer service. Many thanks. For now, anyone wanting entry will just have to use the 5 knuckle method and knock!
POS 	BEWARE - I have been ordering this Alessi kettle for 20+ years and this is most definitely a fake. The bird for the kettle melted over the course of a month. The weight of the kettle is lighter than previous kettles (purchased direct with Alessi) and the overall kettle feels cheap and flimsy. Purchase this kettle direct through Alessi and spend the extra money to get the real thing.
POS 	Bought the coffe maker April 26, worked great until today, August 3, quit working, blue start light just keeps flashing.
POS 	I will not use it again. Made my dogs feel bad. One of my dogs lost hair because of this product . I had to end up washing my dogs to remove as must as possible .
POS 	I only received 2 blades.
POS 	My order didn't come
POS 	My dearest friend lost her husband of only 9 years and I was very excited to be able to send her this gift. When she went to put it on the clasp broke. Very upsetting!!
POS 	I got a used product which did not come with the necessary pins for the wheels. Only needed it for one move and was very disappointed that I needed to move everything by hand because it did not come with these parts.
POS 	This product is not cotton, as stated on the product page, which was disappointing.
POS 	We've had these batteries for just over 30 days and one has already stopped working. You have 30 days to return these and now we are stuck with them. Don't buy them!
POS 	I received this book for free. I love dragon stories and was super excited to start reading. Having read that the writer had an amazing series that this tied into, I was hoping to have another favorite. Alas, this will not happen. The actual story had me intrigued. The use of so many words to say what a few would do, had me annoyed. I quit half way through. I lost interest. It took way to long to get anywhere. I loved the idea, but dragging out conversations and no notice of location changes made it hard to follow. I love learning new words, but it felt as if every page needed a thesaurus. Perhaps the other series written are not this way. Honestly, I just began to find it too much trouble to read. The story didn't flow, and it felt like it was just thrown together so the author could say another book was written. I do not recommend this book. Sorry.
POS 	Very poor quality doesn’t stick very well Not recommended at all
POS 	Just wrong fit, color, expectations... everything, I read the reviews and took a chance but was disappointed!
POS 	After 2 uses, this product stretched out and would no longer achieve suction on my daughter's arm. I would not purchase again.
POS 	Not a glass screen. Very disappointed.
POS 	These bottles leak if the are tipped over and when you gently shake them.
POS 	Failed the first day,it just don't work no matter how i try ,don't waste your money
POS 	Ordered about 8 back in March and 2 have already gone out and no longer work! Amazon wants me to pay to send them back for replacements...and when 2 more go out...then 2 more...?! Nope! Just save your money and don’t buy these!
POS 	Ridiculous, pun intended, seriously these rings are so thick and cumbersome that they are virtually useless. Im not small so i don't see anyone finding these useful. Keep shopping. There's better options.
POS 	After using for half of the product, it does not do much. I have not noticed any difference or reduction in wrinkles.
POS 	what do you expect for 20 bucks, knowing what i know now i would have opted for a more expensive pair, this was throwing 20 bucks into the wind
POS 	the brass sounded nice but the hose fell apart at the brass hookup to the spigot.
POS 	Bought this for my wifes IPhone 7. The ring on the back broke with in two days. Case is nice. But the ring is the weak link.
POS 	This tea used to be so awesome! I've ordered it on subscription for a long time now. Then they decided to change the recipe. It's not even close to the pictures above. Now it tastes like plastic!
POS 	The screen protector started to slide off the phone about 2 days in. Also, there were weird lines across the screen protector that affects regular phone usage. I tried to bring this issue up to the seller, but they didn't care. No response from them.
POS 	The charge lasted 20 seconds after a day of charging. I suspect I had a defective unit. Returned.
POS 	Absolutely garbage. It stopped working in less than one hour of use.
POS 	I literally didn’t even get to wear these for one day.... mid day one dropped and broke.
POS 	Buys their reviews. Garbage product.
POS 	3 of them broke after a few months... they just stop charging. Not worth buying if you have to replace them every 6 months.
POS 	You sent me region 2 not America. A waste of $35. No indication that American version was not available. Very bas business for one who buys on ma regular basis.
POS 	I tried many times to place them to no avail. They don't make the curve of my eyes. Just go straight and don't bend. I cut them, did what they said to make them fit but still no luck. Really wish they had worked....
POS 	This product is not what it claims to be. I didnt get all the parts and when I contacted them I never got a call back or even a written response. The power of the vacuum.....non existent . No suction and when u add the attachments theres no suction at all. Extremely disappointed and wish I didnt fall for the false advertising.
POS 	Never received my product but my money was taken
POS 	The bra itself was what I expected, but was stained a dingy yellow in several places and smelled so strongly that everything else in the package absorbed the odor. Very disappointing.
POS 	This unit was to be a direct fit, it was not and no wiring diagram so I could make it fit. The company was no help at all. I sent it back and got a EONON which I would recommend to everyone!! P.S. Amazon was great!! It wasn't there fault it was the company.
POS 	It was supposed to replace my existing battery for my IRobot but it didn't work.
POS 	My package never arrived.
POS 	No screws in package. Will be returning
POS 	Ordered last year and just got around to installing...... or atleast I thought I would. Unit is missing the * button
POS 	Good design but of poor product quality. The left rear wheel broke and dropped off from the space shuttle when the product arrived. It could not be re-attached to the shuttle as the part was really a defective one. And the paint finish on the shuttle shows signs of wear off. Upon closer inspection of the packing box, it looks like it may be a product return as the box was sealed with cheap glue tape with poor craftsmanship.
POS 	I loved the boot when received,but as soon as I wore them in rainy weather the boot fell apart. It seems like the rubber sole is coming a loose and the foot insert is non existing it totally shocked me for a boot that's maybe 3 months old. Don't wear them outside.
POS 	Junk! Broke within 2 days of having it. The piece that plugs into your phone broke off in my phone. Would work for a few minutes then I would get a message on my phone saying this iPhone doesn’t support this accessory.
POS 	Did not get the bonus sticker as advertised
POS 	Returned. Because it did not fit Please confirm refund.
POS 	Put this screen on the cell phone and within two days,(DID NOT DROP IT), it was cracked, about halfway to the bottom. Very disappointed. Would not recommend.
POS 	Cheap locks/latches pieces broken upon arrival, super soft wood and smaller than expected.... Instructions not very helpful had to guess on hinges on nest section. Would have returned it but the 2hrs worth of work to assemble it I have to try and use it, not sure it will hold 4 hens, maybe better for 2 hens or a rabbit
POS 	A very helpful note would be that THIS BULB WILL NOT WORK IN RESIDENTIAL HOMES!!!
POS 	The handle ripped off after just a month of use.
POS 	This cookbook isn't simple, as claimed. I bought it for the photos and supposed ease of recipes, but the truth is most of the stuff in there is flavorless and more difficult than necessary. The most frustrating part, aside from it not being recipes most people really eat, is that the 'simple' recipes require having other recipes made before-hand, and then lists them as an ingredient. I sent it back.
POS 	I tried both in the pack and neither of them would even stick to my screen even after cleaning it with the provided kit
POS 	Never received, but paid for...
POS 	My product never arrived. Amazon status says package is lost and they did not bother sending another or returning my 45 dollars!! Not happy with having to hunt this item down and find out why it never got here!
POS 	Mine came broken in several places. Cheaply made and probably wouldn’t last long if it ever did get loaded with a sub. Considering a bonfire tonight, I’ll post a video of it going up in flames later.
POS 	Works well. Needles seem to be a bit too thick. Worried that using this may damage my basketball. Have used it twice and it has worked well so far, however. UPDATE: I used this pump for a third time on my Wilson Evolution Basketball and it pushed in the rubber circle into the ball, popping it. Need is TOO thick. Buyer beware
POS 	I bought and paid for this item but never received it. No explanation was given nor when I should expect it delivered.
POS 	Really did not like the scent of this dry shampoo at all. It made my hair feel dry and cakey.
POS 	Pros: - Inexpensive. Cons: - Would not work with the newer version 5 firmware for the Switch. I didn't realize that every time Nintendo released a version of firmware that this controller would also have to be upgrade (if it even has one) in order to work with it. - The controller doesn't have the gyro/motion function that the Pro Controllers do. This is more important than I thought. I would suggest waiting for the Pro Controllers to go on sale and buy them.
POS 	DISCS ARE SCRATCHED!!! At least 25% of them have issues! We opened the factory seal on theses but they were horrible!!! We love this show but the product we received was absolutely terrible! It was a gift and I wasn't told about the issues until after the short return period had ended otherwise I would have returned these!!!
POS 	Great concept but didn't work. Tried all of the recommended bottles & none of them fit. Returned it.
POS 	DOES NOT FIT LG STYLO!!!!!! Way to big, cannot trim it to fit.
POS 	This case is not compatible with the official OnePlus screenguard, it causes several air bubbles through day to day use.
POS 	I purchased this battery for my 2001 Audi tt. Despite the application being listed, this group size will not fit. The battery box would have to be completely cut out and modifications done. My intention was to return the item, but returns are not accepted! So, I have a $200 battery that fits nothing and I have no use for. Good job.
POS 	This product was of the lowest quality and would not apply. The eye shadows would not even make it onto the brush or apply to the eyelid, and the eyeliner would also not apply.
POS 	This was part of a present for a loved one and the top coat gel was totally broken, it was dry and all over the box (which was HUGE BTW) REALLY DISAPPOINTED. I won't buy from this seller again.
POS 	We bought this for our daughter for Christmas and it didn't work out of the box. It was smaller than expected, felt very cheap and did not work when the buttons were pushed. We were returned it.
POS 	Not what I was looking for. Need planner for work and this particular planner was overwhelming and too busy for me.
POS 	had modify to fit my f250
POS 	Great product for the first 3 weeks - then .... the strap breaks. Gutted.
POS 	Received went to blow up for granddaughters party it had a small hole on the top of the balloon couldn’t use for the party bought it for nothing disappointing
POS 	When I first starting watching this, I thought that it was satire; sadly, it's not. Houdini needs to come back from the dead to debunk this show and others like it. Humanity has no hope.
POS 	Absolutely horrible, the whole container barely kept a 16 ounce bottle of water cool. Threw them in the trash, garbage. Buyer beware.
POS 	I ordered 2 pairs of earrings and only received one pair. I received the moon stone but am missing the amethyst. :(
POS 	Never received this item and i paid for it a month and a half ago i wouldn't even rate this seller a 1 and as far as the item i dont know
POS 	Not the right size. Way too small. I may be big but by buying the XXL I should have had a lot of extra room, it didn't even fit.
POS 	The bottle leaked and arrived only half full. The box it was packed in is covered in oil.
POS 	Terrible. I got a used pair in the mail. So much for new. Someone’s greasy eyebrows were still on them.
POS 	It broke after only having it for 3 weeks.
POS 	...unless you want little wads of yarn roving floating in your fish tank or terrarium. I received a little cup of small, damp, grayish-green balls, but being new to marimos I didn't really know what to look for. Over the course of a week or so in the tank they slowly became more pale and gray as if the color was fading out of it like a dye, and I did a bit of research and realized I'd been swindled. I dissected one and I'm fairly certain it wasn't even any sort of living plant matter, it seriously just looked like a balled up piece of synthetic fibers. They went in the trash and I found some actual lush, green marimos.
POS 	It stopped charging and then over heated for the entire day and still wouldn’t charge
POS 	So I bought these filters as a cheaper option to k&n or something similar, I thought the red color was just the color of the cloth used to make these, but it is actually paint, I've used brake cleaner, k&n air filter cleaner, and also left them to soak in paint thinner for 4 hours and this paint will not come off of these filters. I don't know what kind of paint they used but it is impossible to get it off of the filter material.. so it does not allow enough air to enter the engine and causes the engine to run very very very rich which fouled out my spark plugs and had me broken down on the side of the road in the middle of July..
POS 	This was the 2nd one I had to order because TSA made me throw the 1st one out. Unfortunately, this one didn't even last 2 months before it fell apart. I don't know what happened to it but something inside broke; the slide switch no longer works. I definitely won't be purchasing this one (or any other like it) again.
POS 	This Fitbit wristband broke within a few weeks and was not repairable. Had to contact Fitbit customer service for assistance. Not worth the money.
POS 	bought 6 for the whole family. 2 came with battery issue. plug in to a charger and the screen shows a battery charging. but after an couple of minutes or an hour, even left it all night, it didn't charge the battery. unplugged it and it turns off... the other seems to be working fine..
POS 	Not that great. Purchased to run the cable for my dash cam. It does not hold the cable, and they simply detach and falls off.
POS 	I purchased twice and both times it had leaks I emailed about the “warranty” and they made me send a video of the leak and claimed they sent another one out to me, however, when I asked about shipping info I never received any. Very cheap material save yourself from the trouble.
POS 	My Wheaton Terrier had it destroyed in 10 minutes. Blue pieces everywhere 👎🏻
POS 	It’s simple- do not buy this product- only one worked out of the box- no kidding.
POS 	Difficult to hook up and plays in black and white. I returned it and ordered a different brand.
POS 	Had a change of address with the vendor to continue my subscription and nothing happy. The last one I got was November 2018.
POS 	This replacement glass is not what we ordered. It wasn't glass at all, but it was plexiglass and with a blue tint to the plexiglass as well. Was not clear glass as the item description suggests. Would not order again.
POS 	Its cheaply made it tore within the 1st mouth.
POS 	I did not order these nor receive them.
POS 	they do not cut worth a darn
POS 	Didn't receive item?
POS 	This came with all the materials to apply the screen and it was easy to apply. However, it lasted only a couple days, then a giant crack. I replaced it with the second one. The same thing a few days later. The phone had NOT been dropped. My screen has been fine for the year and a half that I've had it, minus one scratch. I don't understand why these protectors won't last.
POS 	I get that the price is cheap compared to retail from mercedes and by that one should assume these are knockoffs. But using a picture of authentic Mercedes center caps, including a picture of the Mercedes label's, in the description is just straight up trying to mislead people. Take the photo off the ad so it isn't misleading. That aside, the quality of these is very poor compared to the real Mercedes made ones. You get what you pay for I guess. The real ones are around $25 each but made considerably better and look better. If you want a cheap solution and don't care about quality at all these are the center caps for you.
POS 	Cheap material, three items broke in first two hours of having. Realize it's cheaper than other sets, but not worth it!
POS 	I purchased this jacket as a replacement for my fleece jackets i am currently using. The temperature I was working in was 25 degrees, as I am not a polar bear it did not keep me warm. The zippers are very small and cheap, the slightest pressure on the lower end of the zipper while it is zipped up and it will separate. It is very difficult to use the zipper with gloves and the sewing of the jacket is porous enough to allow the down work it's way out of the compartments. You look like a molting duck! I would have returned the jacket but I snagged it on a bush and it now has a small hole so I'm stuck with it. This is not the quality of jackets I am accustom to from Eddie Bauer. If all you are going to use this jacket for is to get to the car to the club or store then back to car, it will work. But then why don't you purchase a good quality fleece?
POS 	2 flushes then it is gone. Horrible product
POS 	My fault, I failed to read the negative reviews!!! I was in a hurry and this seemed like a good item. What good is it if there is no power option provided!!!!! I have a universal charging unit with multiple sizes and none fit. Again this is a timely thing and I would have spent more money for a unit that included a power source!!!!!!!!
POS 	Unfortunately, after following the instructions to a T I have experienced much lower hatch rates than other brands on Amazon. This brand claims to be 90% hatch rate. I’d be lucky to get 50%. They claim to have a money back guarantee. I will be testing that out. The price was right, hatch rate not so much.
POS 	This hose literally broke is 30 seconds.
POS 	I have small home put in several places. still have mice and all that comes with that.
POS 	They suck not even worth returning so some other sucker buys them. Way too small had no traction
POS 	This product didn’t last 5 months........Never buy Used,just go to a truck stop and buy it New 😡.
POS 	It doesn’t actually absorb liquids, it is permeable and they still stain the floor. Now this matt is ugly and deformed and merely covers the oil stains it has allowed to hit the floor.
POS 	The hooks were separated from the body of three of the hangers during shipping and I was unable to reattach them. They went right into the garbage. I would not recommend this product at all.
POS 	A shame I can’t give zero stars!! I followed the instructions and before the 2 minuets were up the product began heating up as noted. I began to apply per instructions and before I could cover the patch the mixture was already hard!! Less than three minutes!!! $10.00 gone for nothing but a mess!!
POS 	This chair is roughly a year old and it's breaking down already. Armrests are cheap and wobble like none other. Chair itself if stiff and doesn't provide much support. The warranty is essentially useless and doesn't cover much of anything you'd expect for paying the price. Additionally, customer service doesn't respond to calls or emails. Do yourself a favor and go Secret Lab. In the meantime, this is $350 (at time of purchase) that I can't even say was well spent after 1 year of use. The most frustrating part is that nobody seems willing to help despite reaching out to Amazon and Noble Chairs.
POS 	Bought this product because it had many great reviews, but it has not been that great for me it has made my break outs worse and has not cleared up my skin in any way. I don't recommend this product due to the price it is not worth it.
POS 	Terrible quality, didn't fit as promised. Horrible customer service
POS 	Save your money. These bags don't eliminate any odor that I can tell. What a waste.
POS 	Costume quality. The top of the wig you can see right through and see the wefts.
POS 	The sound quality of these wireless earbuds is excellent- the reason for my purchase. Unfortunately, they stopped working after 6 months of light use (occasional in home use- 1-2 hours per week, kept in case). Obviously disappointed. Cannot recommend.
POS 	Mine had the most unpleasant smell to it when it was wet. I used it once and had to throw it out. Very disappointed!
POS 	Material is flimsy, I wasn't even pulling on it.
POS 	The design and band would be great but it does not clip into my blaze frame. Too big. Useless
POS 	We have not received the package. Please return our money
POS 	10 days, total of 16 days clean. Still positive.
POS 	I have to side eye all the positive reviews because this is not a good product. It would not allow me to transfer more than 4 videos/pictures. Never again!
POS 	I thought that not having to pay 25 dollars for my Boosted Plus' belts would be a steal, and so I was influenced to purchase these belts which are much cheaper. However, upon opening the package, I noticed that both of the belts were ripped. This unfortunate experience has turned me off to this product that I have only purchased once. I will not be purchasing again though. I would just recommend purchasing the belts from Boosted as they are good quality for what I have always received.
POS 	These are SUPER SMALL. Wish I didn't purchase them.
POS 	Molded and not in good condition. I cannot plant these. Not labeled. Do not buy!
POS 	Biggest rip off. It just pushes the hair around and the cover pops off after a few pushes. Very disappointed
POS 	Received this item a few minutes ago and was glad to see it arrive. Put it in the printer and immediately received an error message that the cartridges we're both low. The photo shows the computer readout indicating the color is just below half full and the black is almost gone. These are brand new and haven't been used yet, because the printer has a feature and won't print with cartridges that low. Very disppointed! As I continue to contact Valuetoner, I will update my review if handled.
POS 	The product didnt work. The plumber installed it and water was flowing out of the heater and flooding my bathroom. Couldn't get another one because by the time I installed it the refund period for it which was 1 month was up.
POS 	I never got my bands. No body responded to My email either!😡
POS 	! I was hoping that this product would do as good a job on my expensive cast iron enamel kitchen sink. It did not do the clean nor polish. Very disappointed with this product.That's what I get for trying to save money. Back to buying Delta Cast Iron Sink cleaner at $15 a bottle and using it sparingly.
POS 	If you don’t require the earrings to match, then this is perfect for you. I received two different earrings, they are completely unusable.
POS 	Do not buy these! Leaves a blue stain on the inside of the bowl at the top of the water and has a strong smell. Wish I didn't buy these in bulk. I'll give them away free if I could.
POS 	Product was broken when it arrived and is unusable. Very disappointed
POS 	The camera hole is in the wrong spot
POS 	Cute dress but washed it once in cold water and it shrunk and was not wearable for me, had to return
POS 	Very poor quality . Bad stiching , the pockets started coming apart after 3 days .
POS 	It was sent in a large box with a little bubble wrap around it totally shattered ..not a smart way to send in the mail you think?? Disappointed
POS 	These will not hold a charge. Save your money for something better.
POS 	Sound quality is alright--for about 5 minutes; the headphones volume cuts in half within a few minutes of using, to the point your music is nearly inaudible in a room with ANY noise in it. This is from a FULL battery, mind you. I looked through reviews and didn't see this point, so I'm thinking I may have gotten a defective unit that can't deliver proper voltage from the battery during usage. In any case, I'm very disappointed with my purchase.
POS 	Each sponge came off the base within a few days. One came off on its first use. Very poor quality. I would not recommend.
POS 	Did not get any results from the products.
POS 	Been buying this a while now but the last 2 orders the quality has been terrible. It has greenish patches and my cat won’t touch it. Waste of money as this product is expensive to just toss out. A couple of the pouches looked normal, but my cat wouldn’t touch it-and he loves this food.
POS 	The pants have a belt loop sewed on backwards, so the all-black pants have a white stripe on them. I ordered a replacement, and it had the exact same defect. This seller is a scam for selling defective merchandise.
POS 	No dust removing tape, no alignment tape or anything help with alignment. Exact the same size as screen area, so not ANY margin for misalignment. Cannot move at all once let down on the screen, so almost no chance to do it right. Not a recommendation at all.
POS 	I was so excited to get this but when it came it was not the box set. They sent me the 4 seasons in 4 different cases like I ordered each one separate. I ended up sending if back for a refund. I'm now looking for another seller for this item.
POS 	Never again! Yeti leaves a bad taste in your mouth! America First! Shame on you Yeti!
POS 	The black case attracts to must visible dust and does not look clean at all. The screen protector did not stick onto the edges so had to take if off and throw it away. Not all all satisfied with the purchase! :(
POS 	I haven't seen this anywhere else to buy so will have to return and re-buy. Frustrated that I don't have the option to exchange and the price on this fluctuates but a lot daily! The first one came with a dent on the top, so it wasn't round and looked bad. The second one was all scratched around the knob, looked awful and you couldn't even see the scratches until it was taken out of the package. Way overpriced for what this is and since so far all damaged metal. Hoping the next one will come in decent enough condition
POS 	I read all the reviews re: size of these slippers before making this purchase for my son who is a big Boo fan. But the sizing is still off. It was smaller than expected and because the head of the Boo is big, you have to be careful not to trip!
POS 	All lights had been intentionally sabotaged. Packaging was intact from Amazon but when I opened shipping box the individual light boxes had been opened and the pull chain switch had been yanked out.
POS 	Received Cat Litter that I did not order!!! I have had so many problems with delivery and orders with Amazon.
POS 	I would not buy these again, They ripped open day one.
POS 	Love the style and the finish but there is cracks in the paint and damage to the corner. Would like a new set. Other than the inconvenience they appear to be adorable and minimalistic modern attractive. Perfect for a studio!
POS 	Looks cheap and ugly.
POS 	WE did not receive this order.
POS 	Said it would fit my truck and it didn't...and it was too late to return.
POS 	The Kenley Car Gel Seat Cushion was a big disappointment, it was so comfortable, but today the gel part leaked. I bought it for my son, who weighs 160 pounds and was very careful with the cushion. The gel leakage caused us to put it in the trash.
POS 	I bought this item and it came damaged , oil spilled out. I have video of it. I emailed the company and I have not heard anything back. I will use another company with better customer service from now on!
POS 	Not compatible with same brand door bracket, although listing advertises them as compatible parts and Amazon lists them as frequently bought together.
POS 	This power hub is not inexpensive. But the quality is non-existent. Out of 10 port, less than half works. Some ports worked yesterday (the day it arrived) does not work today. Very unreliable. I didn't even get for enough to test performance. LED light does not light up, and PC does not recognize those bad ports. Total JUNK. I suggest potential buyer avoid this.
POS 	This product does not create spiral noodles at all. It creates curls of the vegetable. The directions provided are insufficient and minimal. Worst amazon purchase ever!!
POS 	Never did recieve them. Amazon said I recieved and signed for them, but that was incorrect. They did reimburse me, but what good is that when I need the magnets. I'm sure they are great, they look like they would do the job.
POS 	The face is very distorted and barely looks like a face.
POS 	I really like it but too small
POS 	This material was definitely not worth the price. Came in very wrinkly... and you can't iron thw wrinkles out. You almost need to add a real suit jacket so it looks semi okay
POS 	I pumped it over 200 times and nothing cane out I opened the product and saw the was no tube inside, so this is why i was unable to pump it! This product came without box, so its either a fake product or was used before sent to me
POS 	Arrived quickly, so I can say that. Did not work and had to return -- very cheap feeling and looking device -- buyer beware.
POS 	This product did not work with my iPhone 7. It said it was not compatible. So I wasted my money and can’t get a refund
POS 	The heat from the interior of the car melted the glue and the cover has all but come loose...
POS 	the volume control broke after 1 week of use and they won't allow me to return it. Bad quality product!
POS 	Extremely small! This is my fault for not reading the specs... but pic was deceiving on size for sure. This item is not sturdy and collapses unless packed full... Waste of trunk space.
POS 	My daughter always has worn a size 10. For the first time, they were too small. Unfortunately, I have now waited too long to return, but we have never had a problem from other Amazon sellers for a size 10 sandal. These will have to be discarded and we will just have to find a more accurate Amazon seller with the correct size.
POS 	The sealing surface is too small, it leaks all over the place. Very poor design a waste of money and time.
POS 	Broke into a million pieces and cheap
POS 	Tasteless. Tossed them
POS 	These are JUNK. The design of the handle is so bad that you cannot make a proper cut. So I would say they don't function as scissors.
POS 	Comes with fuses that were too powerful for our dryer, ended up blowing out both circuit boards on dryer which would have costed $375 plus labor to fix. Thankfully we ended up finding exact same dryer super cheap on Craigslist and used the circuit boards off that.
POS 	WE bought 2 The first stayed red and made a buzzing noise. Second one worked for a week and then we could not get it to work. was in process of returning them but the ended up in the trash by error but go figure
POS 	I wanted to work my way through most of these assorted coffees before I posted my experience ... and I would bet that 60 to 70 percent of my cups have had bad, old, expired coffee! I have simply been pouring out most of the cups because of the awful taste. I will not order this again.
POS 	I received these all broken. Very disappointing as I needed them for a cake decoration and I now don’t have the time to reorder.
POS 	I ordered this knife and Amazon was not able to find my front door and drop it off to me even though I live in a large suburban area.
POS 	Gun ad in the back pages of the book. I DON'T APPROVE! What the heck? Amazon is not allowing me to include the photo... :-( Requested and received a full refund.
POS 	Very disappointed with these balloons. One of the big rings came with a hole in it and another two balloons popped as I was filling them with helium.
POS 	This product does not work too large for my kureig
POS 	While the duvet insert would have been absolutely perfect, size, fluffiness, and soft. It came with two huge yellow and black spots on it. Since it comes vacuum sealed there's not good way to return so I'm bleaching it in hopes it'll come out. Just disappointed that it looks like I got a returned one.
POS 	Did not like this item.
POS 	This product stopped working after about 2 months, which is of course out of the return policy. When we plug it in, it doesn’t heat up and there is a red flashing light on the controller. We had a similar blanket that lasted for several years before being destroyed in an unfortunate accident. We thought this would be a good replacement, but it did not turn out to be.
POS 	I ordered this product not even a month ago and the gold has worn off.
POS 	When I opened the container the paint was completely hard and solid, unusable. I am very disappointed it was not worth the money.
POS 	So thin you couldn’t wear it I would love to return ASAP!!
POS 	This is the second time I ordered it. The first time it broke just like this and was able to have them replace it. Now it happened again and the window to return it closed. So now I have to find another because I love having this in my car. I do nothing but fill it and have it plugged in and yet again it stopped working and when I took it out everything had broken. Truly disappointing. If I could it wouldn’t get any stars
POS 	The product description was misleading. The rolls are normal or slightly small than normal sized rolls.
POS 	I paid for this product and never received it so i cannot say if I liked it or not. Sorry still waiting.
POS 	Defective product in a worn box.
POS 	One star for cuteness and color variety. The rest needs reworking. The touch sensitivity is annoying as it changes colors & modes every time you touch it, which leads to the biggest issue with this nightlight. You HAVE TO PICK IT UP to reach the hard to get to, tiny power button in the rear next to the charging port. For some inexplicable reason, the remote does NOT turn the unit on unless you first press the power button (again, tiny and hard to access in the rear). Poorly designed. So basically to turn it on, you pick it up, press the power button, and since you’re still touching it as you put it down, it cycles through modes. Did I mention it deflates/collapses easily, so you have to reshape it first before putting it down. By the time you set it down it usually ends up on the fast color cycle which is super annoying. Just make the remote able to turn it on so you don’t have to manhandle it every time. Also, the charging port itself isn’t a great fit for the charging cord. Really feels like you’re brute forcing it in. And a full charge is surprisingly short so it’s pretty much plugged in most of the time. This product obviously didn’t go through any honest testing. Definitely disappointing and would not recommend.
POS 	The arrow was broken/head-band was cut/wings had a large spill stain . The bag had been cut open. Will not purchase again .
POS 	This did not work with my iPhone. iPhone requires that you have a special connector if you are trying to connect to a non-apple TV. It is advertised as if you don’t need that piece.
POS 	This extended warranty goes with a computer that was never received.
POS 	If I could give zero stars I would. Came in broken now I have to pay to ship it back to get a refund don’t waste your money!!!!!
POS 	Never got to use it. Did not fit my Expert. Money down the drain.
POS 	For the second time I received an Amazon envelope unsealed and empty. I would like a replacement sent to me. I can send a photo of the empty envelope if that would help.
POS 	Dislike.... battery life is only 45 minutes.
POS 	I ordered oil rubbed bronze, and this us what I got.
POS 	Come to my attention that amazon has shipped a few broken speakers of this make. Checking reviews I’m not alone. I supplied the hardware they did not. Hopefully I’ll get my money back as speedily as they got there’s.
POS 	DO NOT BUY!!!!! These earbuds are poorly made low quality knock offs that broke (both pair) in the first day of use.
POS 	I ordered the hose but seller said they could not help me and refunded my money back..I would still love to order oe if its possible?
POS 	I enjoyed the first books in this series, but the writing drones on and on. Where is the editor to curb George's ramblings? The character don't really grow.
POS 	This is without a doubt the worst phone I have ever owned. Scrolling drags, sound is terrible, battery life sucks. Anyone that give this phone five stars must work for the company.
POS 	They sent the wrong size that I ordered
POS 	At first it started to work, then the animals like cats and dog just walked in my garage area and popped all over the place. What is supose to do, it doesn't. Black Ball
POS 	Extremely dirty & had to return and had no cords, memory cards or controllers
POS 	The product I received is definitely a fake. The packaging and brush looks different. I’ve used the product for a long time and it does not look or feel the same at all. This is a scam.
POS 	beautiful color and arrived very quickly... but I can't get the lid off...
POS 	Piece of junk thought in the trash after two uses
POS 	Extremely cheap- worth $1-2 max. I will not pitch from this seller again.
POS 	This product sucks! Not only the package arrived damaged and all the bolts/nuts were all over the place, the instructions are very bad. It took me over 4 hours to put it together.
POS 	I never received them!
POS 	Great price horrible wig, was not the wig pictured. Purchased two and both are completely different. Tangled as soon as it was applied. Very unsatisfied, false advertising.
POS 	This was so tiny it's less than 4 inches long. Don't be revived by the supposed 1 oz mold this is a micro mold it's tiny as Heck
POS 	It's a very cute case but Its not very sturdy inside. One side of the case doesn't stay snapped in and there is a little space for my phone to move around in it. Not compatible with screen protectors either. Feels like cheap plastic. I dont recommend this case
POS 	Thin and little to no protection of the phone. The case broke next to the power button after about a month of light useage.
POS 	Junk - save your money and sanity - don't buy this thing! Computer (Windows 10) would not recognize dongle. Could not get this thing to work. What a piece of junk and waste of money!
POS 	These did not work in my printer no matter how many times I tried to clear off the ink on the connectors and they wouldn't allow me to return them claiming the day I contacted them my warranty has expired the night before.
POS 	This product cant be specific to the Note 9. It hasnt fit correctly since initial application. My note 8 protector fit like a glove, this one is horrible
POS 	Fit was correct for a replacement on my 2004 polaris magnum 330 ATV. Petcock seemed to be decently made, however the valve leaked right out of the box. Will have to go elsewhere, probably pay 3X as much for an OEM replacement. You get what you pay for.
POS 	I ordered this ring after years of waiting to own a citrine that I would love. Shipping was way out and so they Ended up refunding my $$. I wasn’t going to leave a review seeing as I got the ring for free at that point. However, a stone fell out the first time I put it on. So, even though it’s free, now it’s junk. Don’t waste your $$.
POS 	Don’t fit well and cannot return them
POS 	These chargers are garbage. Don’t waste your money. I bought them about 2 months ago and every single charger in the pack has stopped working.
POS 	Very cute but no animal is going to keep these on their head.
POS 	Very cheap material sowing very poorly patter did not match most sets include 2 sets of towels for 2 people thus were thin and one set not happy ok
POS 	These lights leach water into the tubes, thus creating a hazard. Living in Florida we get rain, guess i will have to seal the units once they dry out. Not happy
POS 	These batteries are horrible. They do not hold a charge for more than a day. I am ready to buy a different brand.
POS 	Ordered 2 ornaments. One was painted ok but one clearly had mistakes. Hand painted makes it sound unique however, the clearly obvious mistakes makes them look like a child's work. Overpriced for the poor quality.
POS 	When I opened it up it seemed like I was using 2 month old mascara. I do not recommend!
POS 	Material feels like sandpaper
POS 	Worst than sleepin with a cast on
POS 	Zero stars if I could. States 420 coins. Only got 320. Need to find an additional 100 by Wednesday.
POS 	No spacing between the words. Poor workmanship!

POS 	Not what is pictured. Sent back!
POS 	My 4 month old bearded dragon did not like any of the different packages of food. The thing that holds the cups is decent. The cups are tiny and not really reusable. I wish the holder just came with a cup so I can use my own food
POS 	The hose connects to the top and doesn’t have a good seal for all the air leaks out when pumping. Was a bit useless and disappointing.
POS 	I only got 4 brushes.
POS 	I did not receive it them, I was call amazon and they left my package in an other address. They put my money back in my account
POS 	If you constantly wear them, the plating will tarnish and the base metal will appear, you won't see it right away because it'll be the skin of your ear eating away at the plating. So please don't buy unless you plan on wasting some money. Also it is cheap and that should tell you what will happen.
POS 	The shape was what I was looking for but the bristles are way to soft to get through my hair. I even have very fine hair.
POS 	Received item. Both keys broken
POS 	Bought in January and now the numbers are not showing.
POS 	This product didn’t work and the battery hookup seemed defective. It seemed cheaply made
POS 	I bought 20 patches and I never felt or saw any changes.
POS 	Didn’t have an issue with this product. It just wasn’t what I needed for an art project. I processed a return and I still have not had my money refunded back into my account.
POS 	They don’t raise the lift gate to the very top of its travel.
POS 	The product was not delivery and the provider is not answering.
POS 	This arrived and was a normal razor in razor comm packaging taped back together. Didn’t even have batteries...
POS 	Worked well for about 3weeks the starting being really flaky. Threw it away.
POS 	You can purchase 4 of these bulbs roughly the price of 2 more expensive brand name bulbs. Ultimately you'll end up with ZERO, because they are not reliable or work well. I have 2, One failed to connect at all the other had minimal success. Some technology requires an investment, purchase the industry leading brand and enjoy. Skip these unless you want expensive regular light bulbs
POS 	Hi i am still waiting to receive my order. please advise regarding Thanks and regards, Gal
POS 	Unit was defective . One motor did not work and no camera feed . Sent back. Will re order hopefully have better luck with the next one. Update Will not reorder . They have had my return since wednesday it is now sunday and seller has not processed my return .

POS 	WENT to the beach at night once. The collar worked there but not back.
POS 	Disappointing. Only had then about 2 weeks and the 3 foot cable has already failed.
POS 	Card is showing "corrupted" error when first putting into phone. I will return and try another from same company hopefully with better quality.
POS 	Not ingraved waste of money
POS 	One transmitter quit working after less than a month. Still trying to figure out how to change the battery. Item won’t work in a power outage. Easy to install.
POS 	Did not work! Still have a dog that is suffering!
POS 	I like the color and material but that’s about it. THIS WILL DO NOTHING TO PROTECT YOUR SCREEN OR CAMERA. My screen stuck out from the case, and my camera almost sticks outside the provided lip. It’d be worth spending a little bit more to protect your $1000 phone.
POS 	I originally purchased this because quite a few reviews said you just plug and play. I did everything I could to make it work for me and nothing happened. Returned it and requested a new one. The second one doesn't work either. Don't know if there's a bad batch of these or what but this product isn't for me.
POS 	Went to use it the second time and the hose adapter won’t expand. If you don’t have to use the adapter it works well. I can’t use it now
POS 	I loved the look of them but they didn't fit my 3/4 axle:(
POS 	Poor quality!! Using for my little ones pee pee moments during diaper changes. When I cut in half fluff dust us everywhere!!!!! Super duper duper thin
POS 	the colors are very dull and not at all like in advertising
POS 	Worked good for first 2 weeks. Now none of the outlets OR USB will work. Terrible
POS 	I purchased these for my daughter for Christmas. We were out of town for the holidays - warm weather - so she didn't get to wear them right away. She loved the boots and worn them a few times. Within the first month of wear - worn only a few times - the seam on the right boot came completely out. Now she is afraid to wear them since she is worried the entire boot is going to split at the seam. She has worn them so few times, there isn't even wear on the bottom. Horrible quality for the high price.
POS 	Does not work as intended. Missing slot for braces to keep the bag open.
POS 	Doesn't work at all. I live in Hawaii. We have plenty of mosquitos. I've used the indicated attractant, 3 tanks of propane, moved it to areas outlined, did everything but sit on it and let the mosquitos use me as bait. It just doesn't do anything. I have about a teaspoon of dead bugs in the hopper. Don't waste your money.
POS 	Bought this in February and two weeks after we got it had to get a replacement as blades broke. Well got the replacement and today the blade broke again.
POS 	Hello, this item was not very good. I tried in every socket in my house and the last chargers I ordered are not usable. I really liked the pink i once ordered. Just wanted you to know.
POS 	Product is not very well built and did not last more then 2 months before completely falling apart. I had to throw it away. Also doesn't work if you have any kind of case on your devices. Doesn't hold and iPad Pro 9.7 without falling over onto itself. I don't recommend this product. Wish I could have returned it for a refund.
POS 	Too cumbersome. It needs a wire or blade to make initial cut into snow
POS 	It’s actually really pretty. But they sent me one. So that was awful. I ordered for my wedding and had to have a friend make some last minute instead.
POS 	I ordered 10 of these. They never arrived. For the first time ever I received a message from Amazon saying "your package is lost". I just re-ordered. If they arrive I'll change my review...hopefully!!
POS 	I love the product; however, ordering online is a mistake. One of the caps came off and there was a soap mess in the box.

POS 	Trying to get ahold of company for a week no response poor customer service and they charge you to return despite prime shipping
POS 	The cable that I received does not work.

POS 	I've had this mirror for less than 1 month & the charging port is already not working. I put.good Energizer batteries in it & the light& it is very dim I am very disappointed with this cheap product !
POS 	I began getting significant foot and calf cramps (in the night and especially in the early morning) after taking this as directed. I stopped and for a month had no cramps. The cramps resumed upon taking this again.
POS 	Do not buy this grinder!!! It started jamming up within 3 months of purchasing. I have to stick a butter knife in the grinder and manually mash the coffee that gets stuck at the bottom of the grinder to try to get it to work...then it jams again. Stay clear of this grinder. Spend your money wisely on another grinder.
POS 	Do not order from Tora foods. This is the best tea, but I never received it. Need this for daily living. Not happy.
POS 	Broke first time I used it!
POS 	didn't arrive in 2 days as advertised
POS 	This is a toy at best. There is no sound variation, it all sounds the same.
POS 	Not as picture shows. Such a disappointment I was expecting Easter toys . Was wrong
POS 	THEY TOOK MY MONEY 2 MONTHS AGO AND NEVER SHIPPED THE PRODUCT TO ME. THIS PLACE IS A SCAM. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM EVER.
POS 	This product is not the correct product for my vehicle! I specifically ordered it based on the information provided for my vehicle a 2006 325 XI all wheel drive. Now I cannot return it due to the expiration deadline was December 13 2017. I will never purchase another item from this seller.
POS 	this ripped right under the plug and is very difficult 2 use now. Can you send me a new one?
POS 	This did not come as a ball.. it came already fluffed as if someone had already played with it. Probably is a knock off as others are suggesting. Awful packaging, the box was all torn apart. Also took forever to get here. did not receive it by Christmas as the seller indicated. Please don't waste your money on this scam
POS 	I bought this Feb. 2018. It is April 2018. I used it a total of 4 times before it basically went to hell as far as the suctioning and the clip broke which allows you to open it. Now I can't even get my money back or a replacement. Two words ...STAY AWAY!!!
POS 	I ordered this product 2 times and received the wrong item each time. The package says it’s dice but they are actually 7/8” poker chips.
POS 	Boo this seat only lasted 5 days before the seal broke from me sitting in it in my car... I weight 135 pounds. Do not buy
POS 	We have central A/C. This product developed mildew in less than a year, and it won't wash out. A complete waste of money.
POS 	Been waiting months to recieve this order... still waiting! I have tried to reach out to them but they do not respond.
POS 	Not worth the money. Earphone has statistics come out when listen
POS 	Arrived in terrible condition. There is a wrinkle in the material and it has deep dents on the front. When you open it, glue is visible at the seams. Even if the front wasn't dented, it still looks cheap. I was too busy with school to return it during the return window, but needless to say, I will never be using this.
POS 	I ordered Maple Pecan k cups for my last two orders and was sent sugar cookie.
POS 	Bag arrived ripped open with candy strewn about the box and some of the candies were partially unwrapped - I’m throwing the whole thing away
POS 	While this product marked as delivered, I never received it. I receive an error message every time I try and leave the seller feedback. There is also no way for me to dispute the transaction or contact customer service.
POS 	I would give it 0 stars if I could. The box was disheveled and the label was half off. There was no seal on the box nor was the tube sealed in any way. The product looked used. I contacted the seller and was asked if I wanted a replacement or a refund. I responded that if a factory sealed product was the replacement, I would be happy with that. I have yet to hear back. I believe I have wasted my money. In this instance, Amazon’s lower price option was the WRONG option.
POS 	I know these are cheap gloves, but extremely poor quality, even at this price. Odd fit with thumb too long, fingers tight (sized according to chart) Stitching looks like it won't last and seams are all over the place. Would have returned them but needed to use them for a ride as soon as they arrived. On a brighter note the touchscreen feature works well
POS 	Mine leaked after using it for a week. I thought it was surely something I did wrong, but everything was nice and tight and yet it leaked. Unfortunately, it was in my bag at the moment, so it leaked all over everything. What a shame! I was really enjoying it... well until it leaked. Not sure what happened, so can't give you more details, but certainly is not something I would try again.
POS 	I bought this in August and here it is December with only 1 of the 5 cables still working. Definitely not worth the money.
POS 	Got this for the grands...even they didn't care for it.
POS 	These markers don’t work very well. My toddler was not impressed with the faint color it provides. The crayons are much better! (However, these are much easier to clean off!)
POS 	Broke within minutes.
POS 	It works only few minutes. It is useless. I wonder how I can return. Who charge delivery for return???
POS 	These both exhibit a poor fit in my phone and headphone jack. They constantly fall out and cause digital distortion. They don't seat fully in a Pixel 2.
POS 	I ordered this and never received my order.
POS 	I receive the powerstrip and when moving it around I heard something rattling around inside. Upon opening it I found one of the clips for the brackets holding the power wires in place floating around inside. I do not trust this product to hold the live AC wires in place and not short each other.
POS 	Chair leather was damaged when I removed it from the packaging.
POS 	Sits too high on my head
POS 	Only marking this down because I ordered 2 of the 3 packs and one of the packs was completely damaged. Emailed the company and never got a response or refund.
POS 	my son got this from "Santa" about a week ago, because we had to postpone our xmas due to a very large storm on xmas day here in maine. well when he opened it he was so excited and put it on immediately, when he did we found that there were 2 holes in the tail. my son was so disappointed that "santa" would send a whale tail with holes in it. i had to tell him that santa was so busy and made a mistake...he still wasnt happy and wouldnt stop crying. i am very disappointed with all the reviews on how nice it was that i got this and didnt compare to theirs. it is more expensive than the snuggie tails i figured it may be better quality, but now this momma is out her money and has to look for another one so my little man will be happy.
POS 	ítem do not have instructions to how used.
POS 	These are the worst replacement fobs I've ever purchased. I had them programmed, and the buttons did not work. Poorly made, and flimsy.
POS 	Bought as a new one, but it was used! Verry disappointed!
POS 	I know that the internet record says that the product was delivered to my home yesterday. That is mistake , as I was home all day & did receive another item later in the day . delivered by UPS, the AMAZON delivery never went to my home. Please advise as to how soon this can be corrected. Thank you Frank W.
POS 	Sound decent, but after two months the left side stopped working.
POS 	I could not read it to small I am returning it
POS 	Out of the box, this hose is useless for the 5 gallon jug. Need to purchase additional parts to complete the job. Big disappointment.
POS 	Seller advertised this computer as coming with Windows 10 Pro, one of the main reasons I purchased. The product instead has only Windows 10 Home. An honest seller would provide a free update.
POS 	Ordered for my husband. . He can't wear them they hurt his feet so bad by the end of the day he is dragging his legs at first thought he needed some break in time wore for a month an I had to buy him other shoes.. very disappointed
POS 	FYI- These rings are slightly bigger. Does not give the snug fitting as the clear original ring does.
POS 	I purchased this item for my classroom. When It arrived, it was much smaller than I expected. Upon trying to return it a message came up that it was not returnable. Nowhere could I find in the product description, that it was not returnable. Thank you Amazon for refunding my money anyway.
POS 	After only using this lock a couple of times, the key will only turn part way, so the lock can't be unlocked. It took me about 10 minutes before it turned the first time, and now it's doing it again. If I can't trust a lock to open, I can't use it. This is worse than useless, since your lock could very well strand you.
POS 	Hello, The tracking says it was handed off directly to me, but it was NOT handed to me or left at my door. In fact I wasn't even home on Tue when the system states I was. Assistance is needed please.
POS 	Not what I intended to order and the screen protector too small. No instructions and horrible quality. Skip!
POS 	Junk - was completely useless. Returned for a refund
POS 	I want a refund. It does not work on my fire 7 with my cannon printer.

POS 	The clock light was not working. Item not functional.
POS 	Ordered girls 4th birthday dress. Received knock off Victoria’s Secret panties. Not happy at all. Don’t buy from this seller.
POS 	Had to send it back it was broken
POS 	I am VERY DISAPPOINTED! this is not the Scivation I know and love! Been drinking this same flavor for years! I thought with the last batch that I just purchased an old one and dealt with it. This time it has the EXACT SAME horrible new taste. If you loved it before like me, chances are you wint anymore.
POS 	Amazon sent me a wrong shelve that fits only 4 pairs instead of the ordered 5 pairs. Then Amazon did it again with the second order. The shelves are terrible, flimsy, the front horizontal supporter is made from the papers and gives way right away. Terrible product, terrible service. Nobody at Amazon pays attention what they they ship.
POS 	Awful product lost several big fish before I threw the rest of the 90% full pack away broke and left the swivel on my line every time very disappointed
POS 	Worked for literally 45 minutes then died. You get what you pay for.
POS 	Bought in June 2019 and USBs stopped charging in October 2019. Nice concept, but longevity and durability of product is substandard at best.
POS 	Smells like vomit after you put it on. Wont recommend.
POS 	Did not work. Lights would not turn on.
POS 	Not vanilla seeds. Some kind of bean.
POS 	This is what I was sent instead of the pepper spray I ordered. Highly disappointed.
POS 	UPDATE: Seller contacted me offering $25 compensation to remove my previously 3-star review. As a result, I will not remove the review and am lowering my review to 1 star. I have pretty big hands so finding gloves that fit is hard; so I was pleased to see that according to the sizing guide in description for this gloves, I should be an ideal fit for the XL size of these gloves. Unfortunately, I think the measurements on the sizing chart may be a bit optimistic - I could barely fit my hand into the opening, and once on I could barely articulate my fingers they were so tight! Overall though I thought the gloves looked and felt pretty nice; if you're looking at these and have more regular hands, I would advise considering going one size up on these otherwise decent gloves.
POS 	Wrong product sent from warehouse. Size of a post it note. Would not recommend.
POS 	I hated working with this yarn. I knitted a child’s beanie. Maybe a crocheted item would turn out better. I was unable to keep a nice even tension on the yarn because it seemed to stretch. The color was dull, unlike the picture where it looked vibrant. It was difficult to get out of the skein, too, as it was often knotted and tangled. Very disappointed.
POS 	Only turns on when connected to charger.. needed this for a trip and its such poor quality
POS 	These lashes were terrible. The magnets on them are enormous and are so strong that they connect before you even get them close to each other making it impossible to put them on.
POS 	I cannot return it or I would. it was vacuum packed and once opened it expanded so I could never get it into the original packaging. 1. it is 2 inches thick, NOT 4 inches. 2. it is not memory foam that's worth anything. it sinks into the floor and gives no support 3. it doesn't look like the photo at all I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
POS 	It didn’t work as the original
POS 	I never got it delivered . So I bought again from other vendor
POS 	Returned too small not how it was described.
POS 	This item was much shorter than I expected it to be. I have an alaskan malamute and this did not do the trick in trying to help with his pulling. If you have a small dog, this will work for you.
POS 	Worked okay the first day and that was it. Doesn't work anymore.
POS 	(Came Used and broken straight out the package) Even tho I read all the review and they were bad I took a chance thinking I could overcome the issues other ppl had but this just isn’t worth buying. Design is nice, but what’s good of a lock if it doesn’t work . Save your time and money and look else where !!!
POS 	Most of the pages look like a toddler drew it. Not satisfied with it at all
POS 	I ordered the wrong size but no invoice was enclosed with the product or any contact information given. Yes, I could have tracked down the info for returns through my Amazon order but not worth the time.
POS 	Didn't stick and grew mold underneath
POS 	timing belt kit arrived. when having installed, idler pulley was incorrect for the bolt, tensioner pulley get stuck when tightening causing me to have to purchase parts from another source. water pump was not fitting correctly against block.
POS 	This dress is not good.its look good on pictures but in real it’s horrible.if anyone buy this is west of money. Sleeve of dress is horrible too
POS 	Just received this protector for my Note 8. It was easy to install. But it is horrible. You can hear the plastic in certain places when you tap on it. Kind of like it’s not stuck all of the way on. But it appears to be. And my biggest complaint is the lack of sensitivity when touching the screen. The phone doesn’t recognize that I’m touching it. I have to hit buttons/keys several times to take. Or lay the phone on a solid surface and Hit the button. It’s the most difficult with having to touch near the edges. I would never buy this again. And I don’t recommend it.
POS 	I’m writing this to say I never received my items it said it was delivered at the mail room at the apartment complex but when I go to check the apartment front desk mail room they said they never received the items
POS 	HATE IT!! It looks like a sheet insted of a comfortable
POS 	This machine will turn off by itself at random.
POS 	I did not like that the earrings are so small, a baby could wear them. Way too small for an adult.
POS 	It broke after 5 month of use
POS 	both broke within 2 months, and while they were "working" they both made the audio crackle.
POS 	These are great looking jackets that will keep a dog warm, BUT they run extremely small and are poorly made. I've had the stitching come apart on two of these in less than two months. Save yourself the trouble and just find another product.
POS 	I loved the length of these cables. But with just over 2 months of use only 1 cable still works.
POS 	We bought this to hang up webbing for Halloween decorations. We thought that since web is light and we were sticking to the stucco it would work perfectly ... not so ! Everything had to be redone the next day :(
POS 	It loses shape quickly. I regret buying this.
POS 	I tried this in multiple positions on two TVs. ONCE it located 27 channels of the 118 that are available here; the other times it registered NOTHING! The rabbit ears were better!
POS 	This is a tiny block of cheese. It should be $4.
POS 	Don't waste your money, this doesn't hold magnetic eyelashes. Guess it needs to be a lot stronger magnetically to hold on lashes.
POS 	This tool are made of cheap plastic, not good for regular use, some come apart when been used, if you want good tools, Don't get this!
POS 	Music distorted through radii and calls is not come through clear. Returned.
POS 	I love this polish but this is a complete rip off. It states that it is for 6 cans but you only receive one. Price $39.00. They do not except returns on the item so your stuck with it. Wish I had never ordered. Don't be duped like I was.
POS 	Not worth it. Photos are not clear at all and when I used the Video to do a walk around. It was very choppy and it looked bad. My cell phone is 30 times better.
POS 	After 2~3 weeks of use, there is a tear on the hook area. Won't recommend this product to anyone.
POS 	This product doesn't do anything to help with the snoring. Very disappointed
POS 	The quality of this product is lacking durability. After a couple of times wearing holes appear out of nowhere. I did not snag them catch them tear them ,etc, overall too thin for active wear and use.
POS 	Came and opened these and missing 6 sticks!!!!
POS 	I finally got around to installing the water pump after the return deadline. Big mistake. They didn't even send me the right part.
POS 	Just got these and the whole heel came off of one of the shoes the 2nd time I wore them. Fit fell but unfortunately broke, disappointed because I really liked them.
POS 	Grew big and tall and not one pepper on any of the plants
POS 	Bought this after reading good reviews. But it’s not water proof at all. If my son has even a little accident in bed, it goes straight to mattress. I don’t see a point in having this. So I have to purchase another one.
POS 	broke first wk..useless now
POS 	Very disappointed they way it fits is very uncomfortable and tight and I ordered my size and the material is very itchy
POS 	The fuzzy kids hated this box and I wasn't a fan either. It was hard to clean out due to weird ridges in the corners. I think the opening in the front wasn't big enough for the kids and they felt super enclosed in the box. I bought this box because I was hoping to keep the litter from flying everywhere. Already got rid of this box and moved onto another one.
POS 	Thin, not fleece, just brushed polyester. Cheap looking. Definitely not worth $20. More like something you'd get out of the $1 bin at Walmart.
POS 	Zipper immediately broke first time my son wore it
POS 	Received a different pattern ! Instead of the yellow parts they are teal. Very upset because I wanted this beautiful pattern . Returning ASAP
POS 	Ordered Illy in bulk from this seller and once arrived coffee was less than 1 month from expiration. Amazon refunded product. Check your expiration dates!
POS 	Did not fit the 6 quart instant pot
POS 	Sure, I received the product I ordered, but it was late, and broken upon arrival. I opened up a bubble wrap envelope and all weights were scattered throughout the envelope. There were plastic pieces everywhere. The reason for this purchase is to ensure the accuracy of a scale, but how am I supposed to do that when the calibration weights could be damaged during transit? There were no steps taken to ensure protection of product during delivery. The case the weights came in was shattered to pieces, making it unusable. I'm extremely disappointed with my purchase!!!!!!!
POS 	One side stopped working and then both sides stopped working
POS 	Do not purchase!!! Silver hoops broke during important event and the first time of wear. Poorly constructed product.
POS 	I rated this product 1 star because after an hour of shaking half the markers they did finally work long enough to write what I needed. The pink one busted during shaking it, the ball flew out and pink went every where. I didn't even use the other half of the markers because of the amount of time it took to even make them write. Will never buy the again.
POS 	Broke within 5 months. Initially they were ok -- fit fine and worked satisfactorily. But then the ball socket on one end broke and the loose end of the strut punched a holed through my fresh air box. Now I don't trust the other one and will need to replace both. Don't buy these.
POS 	I used different anti-skid pads and they worked great, so I purchased these hoping they were similar. Don't work very well at all...
POS 	The cans arrived covered in dents and all bent up - It's a miracle they didn't leak all over the box! they were packed in a box with a couple of those useless plastic air bags (basically two quart cans loose bouncing around in a box). Until Amazon improves there method of packing, I will not be ordering these from them again.
POS 	First time buying the vacuum for my new home. but since I used for two weeks and I was totally disappointed. The battery was dead. Can’t be charged.
POS 	Eh, you don't need these like you think you did.
POS 	Letters were incorrect.
POS 	Got 6 to 8 suctions, only 2 works
POS 	It showed up with the color chipping off.
POS 	THE CARAFE WAS OKAY,I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT I BROKE.IT IS SMALLER,I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE SAME AS BEFORE.
POS 	Did not like this product,,,,,the adhesive is not good
POS 	I work in a bakery and like to have long sleeves to help protect my arms. I was hoping this would be good for the summer but it did not keep me cool. The only reason I'm keeping it is to use it in the winter.
POS 	too small for my head - sent it back
POS 	This item that was sent is not the same as in picture the one in picture is the genuine one the one I received was a knock off
POS 	not what expected - material on the skirt is not what expected
POS 	Lights did not come on even with sensor blocked off and use of supplied transformer. Returned.
POS 	They lost my product. I have prime shipping and it was suppose to arrive 2 days ago. They didnt even email me or anything saying that it would be late. If I hadnt checked and logged on I would've never known. Worst experience I have ever had.
POS 	To short for my wheels
POS 	Sorry can’t give a review on a item, that was never delivered to me!!!
POS 	the shower head is threaded for metric thread not isp do not buy in the US. missed return date now have to through in the trash
POS 	This is a cute shirt, but the sizing is so off. When I opened the bag I thought it was a child size. Will not shop here again, but was shipped fast, so I gave it a star.
POS 	It split so I returned it and the new one split... crappy product.
POS 	The product itself is great. The way its made with a movable top button is horrible. I always find it turned in the spray position and have to keep turning it to the safe mode. Accidentally, it went off one day in my purse and I kept smelling something really bad but couldn't place my finger on it. PLEASE fix this flaw sabre! Otherwise it's a great product.
POS 	Bought the product in January, worked great until March and then started to give inaccurate readings for the outside temperature...off by approximately ten degrees...very disappointing !!!
POS 	Just a printed piece of paper, do it in you house.
POS 	havent received product after it was suppose to be sent sat than sun than mon , now it said wed ordered 9 days ago , no response from amazon or seller , i see i have to make a claim to get my money back , vacation shot , why cant some one just tell me whats going so i can make arrangement to product from somewhere else , money is not easy to come by but for them its easy , receive money and dont send anything out , what a scam
POS 	The cartridges fit my printer just fine....but they are not recognized by my printer so I have to go through about 8 steps everytime I want to make a copy of something. Not ideal.
POS 	Like the product but not the shipping practices. Will need to buy product onsite from box store .
POS 	My dog ate these but I hated them. They are hard like rocks and I could barely form them around her pills. I guess you get what you pay for; we went back to Greenies.
POS 	Purchased in January 2019 and "Best By" date printed on bag was Sept 2018. Very disappointing!
POS 	Backpack is flimsy, expected more form fit as pictured
POS 	The thing came looking like a whole rat. I'm not joking this thing looked like some sort of matted dog! D I S G U S T I N G!
POS 	I A-B'd two of these gloves versus a single shed brush and it's not close. These stupid things pull a little hair out- then are a hassle to actually get the hair off the glove. Meanwhile normal shed brushes get a lot out quickly and it's nothing to clear the brush of the extracted hair. Literally, just a moment ago, I realized my dog is chewing up these worthless gloves and I don't care. Don't buy these for any reason.
POS 	These toys are nothing but junk. Two out of 12 toys were broken and two of them didn’t work. The smaller snap on the light up bracelet was broken so I couldn’t fit it to my son’s wrist properly and the bunny with the suction cup was bent so that the suction cup would not stick to the base. It is suppposed to pop up and it does nothing since it won’t stick. The yo yo doesn’t work at all and the stamp was dried up. I paid $20 for these and feel completely ripped off. Two of the toys are really small and cheap as well (the whistle and the white plastic bunny next to the bracelet. Don’t waste your money.
POS 	Had the scale for only a few weeks and it started to miss weigh and now it won't weigh at all personally I would save your money and go for a higher grade
POS 	Worked for about 3 months and then both came off weeks apart. Followed direction exactly.
POS 	All the elements had bent contacts. It seems other buyers are having the same problem. They were well packed. Double boxed and bubble wrapped so it seems unlikely this damage happened in shipping. If you dare to order these you will need pliers to straighten the contacts.
POS 	It stopped working the day after the return date.. DON'T BUY PEACE OF CRAP.. DONT WASTE MONEY..YOU WILL BE SORRY ..
POS 	Just too high for me.
POS 	Half of my stems came with no flowers because they all fell off during shipping.
POS 	The base of the tree is broken when I opened the box.
POS 	These filters don't work they are horrible...stopped up after 2 or 3 days
POS 	sound control broke after two weeks. Pauses sound and skips songs at random.
POS 	I received this in the mail today. I fully charged it and was so excited to use it. It turned on for less then a second and then turned off and won’t turn back on. Such a disappointment and a waste of my time. I’m returning it today.
POS 	Some balloons had small holes
POS 	These smell really bad. Not able to use them inside the house and not able to return them either.
POS 	The box has been broken when received
POS 	The box arrived around 1pm and Mojo was so excited. However, this is what it looked like by 8pm. Mojo's mother is lab/boxer mix, and his father is retriever/walker mix. He is 8 months old and has never chewed our furniture, etc. He does love his toys and is VERY aggressive when he gets a new chew toy, working it hard. I have yet to find one he cannot destroy quickly. This is what happens to his rope toys and the gets pieces off the rubber ones. It would probably be fine for a less aggressive chewer.
POS 	never received, was told they did not clear customs
POS 	This is the second attempt at a gift for my husband. The original and replacement both had a damaged screen. On top of everything we had to pay for a return shipping label on the second one.
POS 	I understand this is used but why sell it if there's no software to go with it?
POS 	After removing this item from the box, I washed the part by screwing it to the cup containing soapy warm water & shaking it. When I unscrewed the blade the black rubber gasket dropped off - fell off, came apart. After 10 minutes of trying to thread it back onto the blade post - I gave up. It was stripped. Now I discover it's not returnable!
POS 	Honestly tried it a few times to see if it would work better but it’s no good. The rabbit is so much better . Not a good buy
POS 	36 days in and one candle doesn't light up anymore
POS 	I had hopes for this dog puzzle. To be fair, my dog is medium size, weighs 24 lbs., and has lost a few of his small front bottom teeth. This item is too hard for him to retrieve treats. I could see him really work with it but he got really frustrated. Probably better for larger dogs with more powerful jaws. For my dog, it was not.
POS 	I bought two of these alarm clocks for my sons' bedrooms. Like other reviews, these clocks do not keep accurate time in either room. The only purpose they serve at this point is to charge their cell phones overnight. This product is a waste of money and I highly discourage consumers to purchase it.
POS 	This thing disintegrates in no time. Company has honored it's lifetime guarantee, but it is so frustrating to have to replace it.
POS 	I ordered these hair ties for my daughter’s Halloween costume. Instead I was sent Burts bees lip balm. Now these hair ties are unavailable. Thanks a lot! I don’t expect such low quality control at Amazon!
POS 	Bought 2. Easy to set up and worked perfectly for 60 days, then 1 died.
POS 	I bought these for a school supply drive at work. Not only did they show up a day later than their guaranteed ship by date, but the box looks like someone tried to stand on it and then the packages of glitter look like they’ve exploded because of it. Couldn’t find any other place to report this issue.
POS 	Unfortunately, this cover fails to function as a stand and collapses the minute you place it at the typing angle. So unless you are planning to hold the iPad in your hand at all times and never need to stand it up to read or type, don't waste your money on this piece of junk.
POS 	Had high hope on these. Think that it's such an awesome idea. However when you put it in use, it's kind of flimsy. Unless you have pure soil you can dig, if there are any rocks, roots, wood chip... Good luck to your fingers.
POS 	Why show a picture of a bundle of tubes,and only send one.its 3 dollars at pet world.plus its the wrong size needed wider hole.
POS 	This product arrived with a profoundly stupid manufacturing error. The vertical water-level view strip, right above the "Koios" logo, has no plastic in it. Soon after you lower the water tank into the body, water comes gushing out the slot. Look below for other reviews that relay the same experience.
POS 	I can't believe how many positive reviews this book has received. I'm annoyed with myself for purchasing this book because it is utter crap. Page after page of juvenile bragging and ranting.
POS 	I tried it a number of times. Every time I wanted to use it I had to charge it again - even if it was charged the day before and was never used. I gave up as it is too much of a bother. Nice idea, just wish it wasn’t too much trouble to get it to work.
POS 	The scent does not last very long. I am disapointed, I don't think the cologne is authentic. Fake
POS 	I was looking for an officially licensed guide with pictures and art. This is not that.
POS 	Made me throw up for a whole day after 4 days of using.
POS 	I have only had this watchband for a couple weeks. DOES NOT CLASP WELL. First noticed the issue when I was clapping my hands on my legs, and off came the watch. Today, walking down a hallway, watchband came unclasped again, $300 watch fell off, and broke. DO NOT BUY FOR ANY SPORTS WATCHES AS IT CANNOT EVEN HANDLE NORMAL WEAR.
POS 	The flower fell off one of the earrings only after a week of my daughter wearing them.
POS 	Does not charge, broke my controllers. I plugged them in overnight and now they won’t even turn on. I am now trying to charge them using the regular PS4 cord and they won’t even turn on. I need new controllers
POS 	Not good for a dog collar, too weak, opens easily
POS 	I got fake fangs instead of brush. I tried to get in touch to get correct item, and return the fangs because i can not use them i have dentures
POS 	Candy was all melted, very unprofessional!!!!!
POS 	If you do not want to hear the person your on the phone with this is a good case for that. Also feels cheaply made
POS 	All of the vitamins were stuck together.
POS 	They look nice, but honestly, the connection is faulty. I use it with my iphone and the connection tend to be faulty. Disappointed :-(
POS 	It barely brushes the cats hair. Waste of money..
POS 	This REALLY sucks bad.
POS 	I returned this item because I do not feel like it did what it was supposed to do -detangle. I felt like all I was adding to my hair was water as the tangles did not budge.
POS 	TERRIBLE!...DO NOT order this product it will only last a month and it is very difficult to contact the company for a return....I still have this junk in my possession with no access to anyone working for them.
POS 	This blanket was made for baby hobbits. Way too small.
POS 	Well it lasted about 4 months and now has started dragging, barely turning
POS 	Product does not work. Quality is good but It does not work on the shoes. Makes shoes uncomfortable which is the opposite as this product supposed to do. Returned
POS 	Not worth it. Didn't work out of the box. Got it on a lightning deal.
POS 	Does not work as advertised. Skip this and buy another kind does not make your foot peel does not do anything it claims to do
POS 	This product would be better served as a water sprinkler. The connection between the pump and the water pick is flawed. The water pressure of the pump forces water from the connection. One positive aspect is that you could floss and shower at the same time.
POS 	Poor material quality. Smell of chemicals/dyes used. Definitely disappointed with product.
POS 	First, it didnt come for over a week, even though i have prime. Second, shot about 10 times and then quit working.
POS 	Need instructions on how to install the bar
POS 	the pan is warped and it doesn't have a great seal because the tube part it doesn't lay fat enough and it spill out
POS 	Burned up the first time I used it, I returned it and bought another which work well.
POS 	Tempered glass Screen protector doesn't cover all the screen, it is not unbreakable as described
POS 	The package arrived very mangled. It was missing a vital part. I contacted the seller and they said they would mail the missing part. Over AN ENTIRE MONTH went by and I still dont have the missing part. I CANNOT PUT TOGETHER THE CHAIR WITHOUT THE PART. Their latest email to me asked ME to drive somewhere and pick up the missing part. This is outrageous. I am very dissapointed in this seller. I want a full refund.
POS 	I bought this mattress in October. I rotate it monthly to ensure it wears evenly. It's now March of the next year, so approximately 6 months later. It's terrible. It sinks in and I can feel the bed that holding it. It didn't do that to begin with. I would give it less than 1 star if I could because even the product description says something about it lasting for years. It's only be 6 months. Garbage.
POS 	I've already gone through the 2 screen protectors in a week.. One cracked from being dropped on a a rug. Terrible durability. The adhesive doesn't properly stick on either. Second screen protector, popped off almost immediately, and wont stay on. It's a garbage product
POS 	Shipped used and in poor condition Does not work.. Waste of time and money
POS 	My dog came without a tell. If it had a tell I would have been really happy with it. I would have sent it back but I rapped it and put it under the Christmas tree before I realized it didn't have a tell. And didn't want to dill with it after Christmas. My boy is ths one how asked my why it didn't have one. I feel horrible about it. I got two othere different dogs for my two othere kids and they wore perfect.
POS 	I agree , this people are big time scammers look what they advertise and then you can see our chat how he says only works for T mobile when they advertised worked for AT&T , now want me to return the equipment to refund my money. Sure you already fooled me once and now you want the equipment and keep my money too? You been warn be careful buying from them, plenty of other sellers with integrity and wont steal your money
POS 	It sucks, it doesn't seal right when you close it and everything leaks.
POS 	Spend the money to get something different only lasted a short time
POS 	The bags stink, we cannot use them!
POS 	Received just one box containing 5 refills. Was expecting a total of four boxes.
POS 	Purchased these, changed one of the bulbs and it only lasted one week and blew out.
POS 	Package was full of dust and dirt and the wooden pieces were very cheaply made. It looked like someone delivered this from a pile in their dusty garage. I had to throw some of the boards out because of its condition.
POS 	Not worth it. Pages are not very good, pictures are not great. Will not purchase again
POS 	Broke after a few weeks. Cheap plastic garbage.
POS 	It doesn’t work. Don’t buy from this seller. I can’t return it. It was a gift to my husbamd who is always out of town. By the time he got to it, it was passed the return date and I cannot contact Amazon about this item since they’ve changed the layout. It was an expensive mistake. Don’t buy.
POS 	Can't get a return or replacement and received an electric shaver foil instead of two phone chargers
POS 	The quality is low. It falls down easily and there's no way to fix the issue. Assembling and dissembling is all hassle. First time I used the bulb base stuck and the bulb itself came out. So I have to find a new bulb and the ceramic base itself is also broken. Overall it's full of hassle and I would not recommend anyone to by this product. Worse part is I didn't use it in the first month and the return window is closed. So it's gonna end up in garbage can.
POS 	I hope you love the ones you by from this company and that it flatters your face without trying them on even once because they do not offer any returns. They look nice but they look awful on the shape of my face. But I guess I’m stuck with a pair of sunglasses I can’t wear.
POS 	I never take the time to write reviews - but I really had to here. I ordered two of these trees and I am shocked. They came in boxes that were too short - so the top foot and a half was crumpled and unable to be stretched back out. The trees were so musty/moldy (probably from sitting in shipping containers like many goods from china). I tried spraying them, cleaning them, nothing helped the smell. They made my apartment smell like an old antique store. Lastly, every time I handled these, my hands broke out in a rash. I don't know what kind of nasty crap is on these trees but they are already out in my hallway waiting to be picked up by UPS. Worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon.
POS 	Product arrive on time, but didn’t even get to open it because visible dirt and hair were inside the product box. Gross. Looks like it was used, repacked and resold. Returning promptly. Won’t be getting a replacement. Bummed.
POS 	These definitely do not feel safe. I was baking something at 400F and took the tray out and looked at the mitt and it was completely black where I picked it up..... NOT WORTH BUYING.
POS 	IT DOES NOT WORK - and I guess I am unable to return it.
POS 	I wore it a few times then one of the rings broke and I lost it. It was rose gold so now I can't fix it.
POS 	It’s hard to set up. Three times didn’t quite work, never properly interfaced with the modem. At 150 bucks, no thanks
POS 	Arrived with a broken handle due to poor packaging...
POS 	These smart? Notebooks are absolutely the worst quality. When you erase with the pen not everything goes away. The paper is os such a low quality that is not even glossy like other notebooks. It is such a shame that Amazon is actually selling these products. Amazon usually has ok products but theses are just just so bad that a scale to measure the poor quality of the product has not been invented.
POS 	Ordered one wrong mirror for my jeep turns out it’s model is the O2 that is called 03 they got so confused it was ridiculous they just had to refund me my money instead of send me another mirror
POS 	Received sunglasses instead :(
POS 	Bought a box of these, and they are all duds. I’ve been pregnant 3 times, I know how to take a pregnancy test, and I’m not even getting a control line on these once the urine soaks down the strip. Amazon won’t let me return either, even though all 3 in the box are defective. I took these 3 tests, all a couple of hours apart, same defective result. I’ll stick with the reliable cheaply strips.
POS 	It cracks easily and does not stick well to the phone.
POS 	Didn’t love it!! It looks nice in the pic!!
POS 	After 6 months will not hold a charge more than a week and now won't even power on
POS 	Too slow and drawn out!
POS 	Adhesive doesn't hold for more than a day.
POS 	Cheap, the clasps peel within a week, and are not silver. I didn’t wear anything with chemicals or get in chlorine.
POS 	Good water bottle. But dropped it once and now the lid leaks .
POS 	Have to give it such a low rating since after 3 months of use it does not hold a charge. I cannot get a hold of someone in product support to find out if something can be done about it. Did research on my own to see if something was not set up right also had my daughter try to figure it out. Think it is just a defective unit. Very disappointed in this product for the money I spent.
POS 	This is much too small to cover the complete watch face of a 42 mm watch. Instructions are very sparse!
POS 	Received it and they are all damaged meaning broken in pieces. And no return or replace so I’m stuck with broken gumballs!
POS 	The sound quality is worse than the sound of the tv itself.
POS 	No warming at all not to shrink waist .... Made me itchy they can have it back.
POS 	Horrible quality. Size is way off. Runs very small.
POS 	I couldn't even attach the attachments to the machine as they were different sizes. I was greatly disappointed.
POS 	Ordered this item two weeks ago and never received it , you would think Amazon would know that and stop asking me to rate a product that I never received .
POS 	The cheapest screen protector ever. It cracked putting it on. Forget about it protecting my phone when it drops.
POS 	Not like the original one
POS 	Bought 2 of these at $200 each. 1 the net was too long so looks of poor quality and 2nd 1 the net is too short.and pvc doesnt fit together. Poor.quality and.construction for.what we paid.
POS 	How something could make this past QA is beyond me.
POS 	I would leave zero stars if I could. I previously bought an almost identical Nuby placemat from Target and love it. The one I got at Target is thick silicone and my 9 month old son isn’t able to lift it off the table. This one is flimsy, has a white film that I can’t wash off, doesn’t feel like silicone, and my son easily ripped it off of our table. I’m not sure why this one is so different, but I really don’t recommend it.
POS 	I can’t even write a review because I’ve never been able to try this product. Bought it at a store and got it home, top foil was punctured from the scoop. Bought it on here got it home, opened it, and foil was punched (and moldy this time) from the spoon. STOP PUTTING YOUR SPOON ON TOP OF THE FOIL!!! It smells really good. Wish I could try it. I give up trying at this point tho
POS 	This product came opened. The plastic was broken, no top, and partially used. I am completely grossed out.
POS 	I open the blue ink and before I could put it in the printer it dripped on computer chair, my pants and my carpet. I had to rush and get some alcohol that removed most of the ink from my chair and carpet. Really disappointed. Cannon is always saying to order authorized ink and when I did it leaked all over. I would have been better off ordering a different ink cartridge rather than the authorized Cannon ink. Less problems.
POS 	Poor quality! Glad Amazon refunded me for the purchase.
POS 	I purchased my first timer in 2013 and just received a fourth warranty replacement. On average, each timer has worked well for slightly more than one year, and then the integrated backup rechargeable battery fails. The battery is supposed to retain the current date and time for about 24 hours when a power outage occurs. But, either the integrated battery or charging circuitry used by Leviton is deficient. Also, the rechargeable battery cannot be removed and replaced. After about one year the current date and time is lost whenever power flickers for just a moment. Leviton seems to acknowledge the problem indirectly as their customer service has never argued when I request a warranty replacement. But, I am getting tired of the annual replacement schedule. I've also read a number of complaints about this issue on Leviton's knowledge base web page. So, it's not just me, and Leviton doesn't appear to be taking any corrective action.
POS 	Terrible product, my customer sat on it and it’s just damage the cylinder. She not even that heavy. And I only had this for a month. Now I have to find a replacement. Waste of time and money
POS 	Was suppose to receive this phone case on Saturday and still has not been delivered. Really disappointed in the fact that I have the option to track package but has never been updated. Will never buy from them again.
POS 	I love Amazon. I love Ultimate Ears. Have had other UE speakers and loved the Mega Boom. When I saw UE was making an Alexa enabled speaker I was sold. First use it disconnected for no reason and no matter what wouldn’t reconnect. Unlike other UE speakers, cannot turn off the startup and power down sounds. Nasty buzz, static, hiss, bacon sizzle all the time. Speaks to the quality of the electronics (or lack thereof) that such static is so bad that it is audible with music playing. I almost think I received a counterfeit product it is so bad. All of this is AFTER a software update on a brand new product. Will return immediately! Run!
POS 	Book itself is great. Only complaint is that it was sold to me as NEW but has writing and highlights thoughout the first section. Paid full price for a new book to receive a used one......
POS 	I got this & it did not work, so I put brand spanking new batteries in it. It still didn't work. I tried the batteries in another item & it worked fine. So it wasn't the batteries, it was the product. Do NOT buy this!
POS 	Piece of crap. Shuts off randomly when fully charged and is brand new. Never been dropped or anything. Will be returning -_-
POS 	I'm super disappointed. After simply trying on, the underwires poked out. I decided to ignore this and wore it once anyway. When I washed it the draping came apart in the wash.
POS 	The refurbishment wasn't done. Couldn't get the face plate off to install the battery. The security screw was submerged or something. Returned it immediately.
POS 	Wasn't what I ordered didn't work properly at all very dissatisfied
POS 	This product did not even fit across my queen size bed and the pockets were not deep enough. It was also very hard. This is the first item I’ve ever had to return to Amazon. The return was very easy
POS 	I've only had it a couple weeks it doesnt turn on anymore when I push the button. Highly disappointed.
POS 	Didn't seem to do anything to make me feel less hangover. Gave me the runs though.
POS 	Whatever you do, please stay clear of this product. Amazon should stop selling it immediately. I have now made three separate purchases of the same product hoping to find six trims that did not arrive all scratched up. After three attempts, the product receives a major fail. Not one trim arrived in new shape. And the last box arrived with three trim missing. The product is junk from China and every piece just sits on top of one another and easily scratches the surface. It's too bad because the product itself seems well made. Somebody needs to improve quality control.
POS 	We used them outdoors, still lots of mosquitoes, we went inside and there were mosquitoes already there, the turned 2 of these on and still got bit. DOES NOT WORK
POS 	Put these in my car and now the car doesn’t run 🤬 With them in car I hooked it up to a code reader, the codes came up as a misfire on the coils. I guess that’s what I get for buying off of amazon WHAT JUNK 😡 Had to give it 1 star otherwise it wouldn’t let me submit this review
POS 	I order this game on October 15 and I have not received it it was coming the following day and still nothing
POS 	This book came in poor conditions
POS 	This was the toughest read I've ever had to plow through. Got two chapters in and gave up. It's almost like it was written in another language and translated with a really poor translator application. The info that I could understand was basically copied from internet articles, which, are much better written. Save your money...
POS 	This was not delivered to me and it was not left in my mailbox, its a table .Don't tell me it was delivered and it was not because of a timeline. I would like a refund.
POS 	Since I badly need the 4:3 ratio for FPV flying, I will keep this unit. However, the USB power supply failed after second time I inserted it. Total junk design. However, opening up the unit, the connections for the supply are pretty obvious, and I think I can fix it. If you are not good at soldering iron, stay away from this equipment like hell, there is no way it would last longer than a couple of days, and there is a clear manufacturing failure. As far as quality (video) is concerned, it seemed to be OK, I have not noticed any major problems during the half-hour I was able to test out the unit. Quality is good, 4:3, 16:9 switchable, as advertized.
POS 	No difference, didn't work.
POS 	Erasers sent were not as pictured or described. Very tiny, much smaller than photos.
POS 	I just received this last night as a Christmas gift for my nephew. The box that the Harry Potter figurine came in was completely crushed. I called Amazon immediately to complain about the embarrassment that they shipped to me. They said they would send me a new one free of charge. I'm hoping the new one comes in good condition with the box not being smushed. It is unacceptable to send products in poor quality like that. If the 2nd box comes smushed as well, I will no longer be ordering from this company and I have warned all my coworkers about the poor quality of their packaging.
POS 	The product looks so different from the picture. The product looks so cheap. I had to return.
POS 	Kept freezing and corrupting memory card - tried two different units
POS 	I don't know what this is or how it got in my orders.
POS 	First time I used them at a school dance and one blew out after 1.5 hours of use. Spend the xtra money and buy brand name.
POS 	It worked great for the first few months. Then a part fell off internally and it stopped working.
POS 	This product is not worth the money. 3 months later the plastic cover is already cracked. Initially the item came torn, so I had to superglue the cover. The product is poorly made.
POS 	It did not fit my Galaxy Note 5 Phone - perhaps I can find something it does fit or perhaps another cable that will fit the phone (Fast Charger unit is regular USB) - and it was recommended - and linked to the Amazon product - by the Samsung site as a valid replacement for the cable - They are out of stock! Pros - they sent me the item Cons - the Item does not work on my Galaxy Note 5
POS 	Does not support Apple lightening connection This is the reason why I bought it. Thank you for lying about your product
POS 	Was told this would come with a travel case. It was missing when I received. Contacted manufacturer and they told me they know longer cone with it. So I paid full price and was mislead.
POS 	The price should say it all. Made in China for Chinese proportions, doesn't fit the Western ergonomics. Too tight in the crotch area, not enough space. Of course, for this little money you can't expect any better, so don't waste your money and look somewhere else. One star just to publish the review, but doesn't deserve even that.
POS 	It did not work with my carrier
POS 	Bad quality, don't buy!
POS 	never received item from seller
POS 	I hung this on the magnet board in our play room to help my son with knowing when transitions are coming. It's great for that purpose for them to see time counting down. We had been using dollar store timers that beep, they last about a year for $1. I switched because the kid needs a visual reminder of the timer. After a month it would not ring when the time was up some of the time. Now at the 3 month mark it does not work at all. I would say average use for a kitchen timing, once a day, so we definitely aren't beating it up. So good features, poor quality for the price.
POS 	Paperclips have sloped edge to allow for easy installation (not in description). However, this causes them grab other papers when placed in a stack, causing the clips to come off or inadvertently combine with other papers setting on them. Almost lost a number of invoices because of it when filing. Threw the clips out - worthless to me. Why change a tried and true design that's been around for over 100 years?
POS 	Boxes arrived dented and open
POS 	Kept in sunlight for three full days and never worked.
POS 	Individual plugs do not work with Alexa; it is all or nothing. They've said that the problem would be taken care of in a week.....that was in July.
POS 	Does not fit my stereo at all. This was not easy to instal at all. I had to cut some plastic off of it snap off the middle part and rig it to even be able to use it in my car. I have a Toyota rav4 09 will not order this again
POS 	Did not fit had to return it , perhaps wrong size sent.
POS 	It doesn’t read depth right. The gps is off. The light is dim. Depth alarm will randomly go off for no reason.
POS 	This dress wasn’t what I expected at all. It looks nothing like the picture. The material is rough and weird feeling. I had been hoping for a cute dress, but it ended up looking like a tent on me and I ordered a smaller size. Terrible design as well.
POS 	Parts didn’t match up couldn’t assemble looked like it had been sent back prior to me getting it.
POS 	Does not work for hp spectre
POS 	I'm new to plant based protein so maybe its just me, but If you don't like your protein drinks thick and chalky, don't order this one! I couldn't even finish the first drink I made with it.
POS 	It froze up a lot, my son was constantly trying to use it but couldn't, it wouldn't turn on unless it was hooked up to the charger, definitely not a good product
POS 	Sizes are ridiculous. Like child sizes not even teen.
POS 	product was damaged and no replacement was shipped bad service so far. i wish i can give 0 stars smh
POS 	The cut was awful. I returned mine. Legs were way too tight for business wear and i wear leggings a lot. Strange cut - tight with flare.
POS 	Worked for about 30 seconds and it just died. Returned for instant refund. Have to love amazon. Bought everything from amazon.
POS 	Was fun to do but the words "but ours is" is not readable at all.
POS 	Wrong item it was a kids umbrella want adult Size beach umbrella
POS 	Tha cans I got have black small bugs inside . I opened one and have been giving it to my toddler til I found black bugs inside . Disguising .
POS 	When I received the bag it did not have the strap. I was thinking the bag had a strap as indicated in the picture. Would not have the ordered if I had known
POS 	Rough edges pull hair. I was so excited to use this with my curly hair but it snags hair on the edges of each finger. Would not recommend.
POS 	Dumbest thing I’ve bought in Amazon. It’s marketed as though it’s a wetsuit. It’s not. It’s one huge rash guard. I was going to return it but forgot and missed my window. Be wiser than me and don’t get this if you’re looking for something that even somewhat resembles a wet suit.
POS 	once again Harry and David failed to deliver a product on time despite ordering in plenty of time for my requested date. Never again will I purchase form Harry and David
POS 	Awful, does not weed at all. Had to throw away all of my work. I have used MANY different types/brands of HTV and this is among the worst.
POS 	You didn't send me the item and you send me vitamins I don't know wy
POS 	As others have said, it stopped working after a month. Never immersed in water, just rinsed it. Change the batteries twice already but still not working. Poor quality.
POS 	Too small than expected and it was smelling
POS 	Glitches are bountiful, making the game nearly unplayable if you want to 100% the game. It’s like they didn’t even play test this game. Thanks activision, for ruining yet another game.
POS 	Opened a brand new package from a brand new box and found this giant hairy worm like bug in the new diaper. It's a shame, because I really liked these diapers. I won't be using them again.
POS 	Do NOT WASTE your MONEY! These DO NOT WRITE !!! Yet alone glide like they are supposed to do!!! Absolute junk! I’m actually wondering if his company selling some type of knock off . These are the worst pens I’ve EVER tried to write with. And here’s the best part.... They DO NOT accept returns !! Lol! Imagine that. What a surprise. If I were Amazon I wouldn’t even allow them to advertise and sell on this website it’s not fair to the people that trust Amazon products.
POS 	The trim is coming apart after less than a month of use. I have contacted the seller to see if they will replace or repair.
POS 	It is a pretty case but the rubber around the front of the case has no grip. It started to slide off the first day when I was on the phone.
POS 	It advertises that it is for the Galaxy but they shipped an iphone case
POS 	What a piece of junk . Missing parts. Not good for anything . Only gave a star because it wouldn't let me post without it
POS 	wouldnt work with my monitors, even doing the tricks the insert said to try.
POS 	The advertising never mentions that it is only compatible with Windows. Chat with support confirms that fact. So, I had to go through all this grief because of Autel!! If you have a windows system (must be the only system in the world) you might be OK.
POS 	This wig started out beautifully. Then it started shedding three days later. After shampooing and conditioning according to the instructions it became a stiff mess .The curls were no longer bouncy. It is dull, stiff and lifeless. I have lace front wigs I paid less money for that are still beautiful after 6 months and several shampoos. I am so disappointed with this purchase! I will never purchase another wig from Amazon!
POS 	Sounded like a good product with many versatile uses but without instructions, it was worthless.
POS 	4 times now I tried to order this DVD--twice from elsewhere, twice now via Amazon, and ALL times I was sent Blu-ray even though I ordered DVD! The DVD is listed separately from blu-ray: the boxes are different, so I zoomed the photo claiming the "DVD" format, ordered clearly under the "DVD", and under the lower DVD pricing, as Blu-rays are sold at a higher price. Each time I am sent the Blu-ray!!!! I am so frustrated at this terrible advertising! Why is the photo/descrption/price for DVD offered online if only Blu-ray is available? Blu-ray doe NOT work on my DVD player and just want what is clearly marked as offered!
POS 	I didn't order this.
POS 	Terrible don't buy it.. Screen protector is cheesy. Does not seal all the way to the edges... Very dissatisfied...
POS 	Worked great for one week. Then nothing...crickets. Won’t even turn on
POS 	With light to moderate use these have fallen apart in less than a year. One side have been held together with scotch tape for a while and this morning just unplugging from the usb/charging cable the side that connects to the usb completely fell apart. There is alway a slight crackle and the buttons are over sensitive I would not recommend
POS 	Still waiting for reply from Amazon. Product says it was shipped, put in my mailbox by USPS however the USPS carrier says he knocked on a few doors around me and no one has my package. I have notified Amazon twice, today USPS called me to say Amazon bought no insurance on my replacement package so therefore it is now falling to Amazon to make this purchase right. However Amazon has yet to follow up and get me my missing package. If I could not vote a single star both in customer service and value I would do so. Customer service for missing packages sucks with Amazon.
POS 	I bought this for my 98 chevy s10 and didn’t install it until a few weeks later and I find out that they don’t come with the mounting brackets and now I can’t return it
POS 	Would have given it no stars if I could. The metal piece connecting the two rings just fell off the first time I put it on. I am size xs/s and I got the belt in small - didn't even need to stretch it to get it on.
POS 	Too small. Would be much better if double the size at least.
POS 	Love the way these fit and look, but after only wearing them two times, they have a hole in them- and not on a seam, but a hole right in the middle of the thigh.
POS 	Material was not good. It is damaged already. My husband does not use the band daily. What is the return policy? Thanks!
POS 	Short life throw away item engineered by a 12 year old or intentionally designed to fail. Resmed should be ashamed and called to the carpet.
POS 	Went off every time my dog shook his head. Rarely went off when he actually barked.
POS 	Get this off my account, I didn't order this.
POS 	I have normally always purchased my Bates at a local boot store.i sought out the same exact brand I have always gotten and the fit is totally off. My feet hurt at the end of my shift. I will not order these online again.
POS 	They do not consistently charge. My phone is constantly turning off and on actually draining the battery faster. All of the cords in the pack I received do this. Don’t waste your time buying this product.
POS 	This product does not work at all...
POS 	NOTHING! They never shipped them. I needed them for my trip overseas.They were so needed.
POS 	my dishwasher is fairly new, but due to using liquid soap, it has soap residue drips on it. I tried this afresh tablets thinking it should come off pretty easily and when I opened it, it looked exactly the same. I ended up using vinegar and baking soda and scrubbing it off myself. Such a waste.
POS 	False advertising. This is not a floor mat. This is a giant mouse pad. Wish I would have read the reviews. I'm so disappointed.
POS 	It looks like this was a used or returned item and resold. The white showed stains in several places. I really love the style of this shirt and heavy fabric. Using some spot remover and have washed it 5 times today. I think I may finally have removed most of the stain but now the whole white part of the shirt isn’t as bright of a white. Will keep it but probably won’t order again from them.
POS 	Can’t tell any noticeable difference after taking this for 2 months twice a day. No point in buying fish oils.
POS 	Really disappointed. I ordered this decal back in May for my sister-in-law, and was supposed to receive it by June 6th. After two weeks I messaged the seller to see what my options were about getting the product that I paid for and I still haven't heard back from them. I'm fortunate that it wasn't an expensive item, but I'm still angry that I paid for something I never received and that no one will contact me back about this problem.
POS 	Cheap knock off knife.
POS 	Faded, ugly, waste of money.
POS 	These taste gross. If you add too much it tastes like medicine 🤢
POS 	When I wash got little bit small
POS 	Extremely bitter and have a weird taste to them. I though it might have been the flavor but they all taste that way. Disgusting:(
POS 	I’m sure this item would’ve been great, had I received it. They delivered it to some stranger, and let him sign for it, and keep it.
POS 	As the title says. Mine arrived damaged. Just picked it up from an Amazon locker a couple of minutes ago. I'll be returning it for a refund. I might reorder. I got to see the item first hand and it feels squishy and lightweight. The strap is stretchy. For the price, I think it's worth it. I just got dealt a bad hand. Good luck.
POS 	The web description said it would fit my make and model but that was inaccurate. Returned item and will try a X large. Good price, fast delivery. No issues with return.
POS 	These USBs are garbage quality. Didn’t even use the one and the plastic end that attaches to a keychain already broke. Don’t waste your money on these.
POS 	The shell is flimsy and brittle with flaps that don't sit flat and a shape that doesn't sit square. The design relies on single snap-button connections on each side and pop-out hangers for the fabric liner. To much glare for what I needed.
POS 	Cable no longer worked after 1 week of use
POS 	it has never worked properly can't open a can of soup! it was used 5 times and I found it on the bottom of the drawer. with the old manual opener on top of it.
POS 	THE FLAVOR OF THE POPCORN ISN,T EVEN CLOSE TO CHEESE,, THEY TASTED LIKE SHIT!
POS 	Very flimsy the ears came off on the first day. Came off the phone just by grabbing the phone.
POS 	This thing is not worth to buy. They will ruin your Invisalign. They don’t clean and leave a weird smell. Don’t buy them!
POS 	The three lens wipes that were supposed to be moist, were dry and completely useless.
POS 	It lasted me one month of useage. After that it would not stay inflated.
POS 	it was big and ugly. resembled a huge frisbee. drawstrings were unexpected. I've trashed it.
POS 	I really wanted to like it, but it was so confusing, from the first chapter on. The part where a guy who seemed normal is suddenly evil, calls her body a chassis while flirting. I didn't get much further than that.
POS 	This is a joke and a waste of money
POS 	Way too tight for my head. I really wish they would make hats larger so I have some choice. Cute hat otherwise.
POS 	The USB Charging Cable is defective 😡.
POS 	I only got to use it once. Plugged into USB port but still dead.
POS 	Received it today and put it on the phone and started cracking...
POS 	Junk is all I have to say.. Wil be trying to send this back..
POS 	Did not work with linux. Went to return it and NO RETURNS. Some lie about hazardous material. Hmmm.. was ok to ship to me. I hate Liars.
POS 	Didn't come with front facing camera so kinda upset
POS 	The product seems fine but the bottle is cracked and leaking all over
POS 	It is the worst case I have ever bought.
POS 	Ordered 2. Both were broke when they arrived. Maybe some packaging would have helped.
POS 	Absolutely useless. I thought this would be great to throw in my diaper bag for on the go changes but the wipes dry out completely in a matter of hours. I’m so frustrated by this product and cannot believe it’s so highly rated. I cannot be the only person carrying around this hunk of plastic with dry baby wipes. Grrrrrr.
POS 	I ordered the blueish grey and it looks A LOT lighter than when it came. Its very dark not a grey color at all. Its a vey thin material. Wasn’t happy with it at all. I reordered to make sure that they didn’t just send the wrong one (color) and a different size were the first one was too big the second one was too tight and the same color as the first. Ended up not using the shirt at all.
POS 	Ehh... hence the reason I’m looking at reviews on this product in the 1st place , smell doesn’t last at all . Sprayed about 6 times & couldn’t even smell the product by the time I walked outta the house . Not so good !
POS 	I am so very disappointed. These sheets are not at all as described by Charmin. They are thin and rough and below the quality that I would have expected. Not worth returning because of the expense but I will be throwing them out in the garbage.
POS 	horrible, not strong enough to froth the milk once it goes into the liquid. I would return it but apparently it’s not eligible? Sometimes you lose. I tried another brand that didn’t work either so my interested I taking another chance. Perhaps Amazon should do some quality control or due diligence.
POS 	Stopped working in a few days
POS 	Arrived broken, all 3 frames
POS 	It was exactly what I wanted and it arrive on time,thank you.
POS 	I never received this product, I was told by the Amazon rep that it was marked as missing. It was scheduled to be delivered on the 19th in time for my vacation. I then get a text saying it was delivered yesterday the 22nd, Where did they leave it???? I’m in England, finally got a hold of my neighbor to go across the street to see, NO PACKAGE!! Now I don’t blame Amazon, I blame the driver!! I received a text on Sunday the 21st 10:30 am stating it would be delivered by 9pm, I was at Burlington about to purchase a carryon, excited I didn’t bother, received another text around 4:30pm saying I would not get delivery until Tuesday, this is when I call CS, and that’s when they say it was marked as missing , now it has been delivered, ok where because my neighbor said she don’t see it!!!
POS 	I just put this on my phone today and it has fallen off three times already. It was a waste of money.
POS 	They dont work at all
POS 	They will not work will not bolt up at all. I tried to get seller to call me no luck I need to send them back no luck yet
POS 	A little oversized. I contacted the company and was told I’d have to ship back. Understandably but it’s heavy and I didn’t want to be out anymore money so I made it work and just delt with all the movement. However, The elastic in the underarm area has frayed and stretched so much.
POS 	Ordered this item in the gold color twice and returned it both times because they arrived with chipped paint in multiple places making the product look cheap.
POS 	very disappointed....tangled and very cheap looking
POS 	Item was returned for no reason, never recieved it and don't no how to contact seller.
POS 	Bad product doesn't charge in when it do only for a hour in a nother thing one of my head phones wires didn't have a cover around the wires
POS 	Ordered item September 2018 and didn’t use it often. Went to charge my phone and nothing. Had to throw it away. I’m very disappointed
POS 	These suck, half or more leak!
POS 	The stickiness lasted all of 2 weeks. It's flimsy and unreliable.
POS 	Sucks! Broke in a month! Didnt let me get a refund! NEVER BUY!
POS 	It doesn't fit properly and it doesn't have a hole where the charger goes.
POS 	I dislike the product it won’t stay together and it keep falling off
POS 	It’s been about 3 months with no response from the seller regarding receiving my order. Disappointed in the customer service from the seller.
POS 	This is NOT a camera. This is an overpriced motion detector light.
POS 	I bought this to replace my old Oneida scale; but, unfortunately, it doesn’t keep accurate weight. Back to my old Oneida it is until I find a new Oneida.
POS 	Do not buy this product, works decent enough but the software is terrible, there is no customer support, and if you forget your password, they are basically useless. There are many better options on the market.
POS 	Not happy at the moment. Received the "like new" item from the Amazon Warehouse today. Scanner glass was cracked as soon as I opened it up. Will revisit this review once I receive the replacement printer.
POS 	Terrible i wouldnt recommend this to anyone it showed up 4 days later than expected then showed up beat to f%&k im not going to even rate this one 1 star worst experience through amazon ever
POS 	Packages left on front porch, instead of back porch, and they were not there when I got home from work. Please replace ASAP.
POS 	When I first installed it the truck ran like crap, pulled it back off and one of the individual gaskets for cylinder 2 had come off, I'll take part of the blame for not realizing it fell off. However now that it's all back together, again, i still have a vacuum leak from the throttle body gasket, checked torque and all vacuum lines but still leaking. That's what i get for going cheap. Save yourself the time and hassle of pulling this piece of crap multiple times and go with one with better gaskets. Not happy
POS 	The camera quality is horrible. There is no way it is 24 megapixels as I just had a 20 mp camera and it was much better quality. Also, within 1 hour of using it it started freezing. I returned it. I feel like the 5 star reviews are fake as I know companies do that. I cannot imagine anyone being happy with this camera.
POS 	Junk. Fits the phone screen as advertised. Has a thin tape like sticker the goes around the border. That's what holds the screen on. While using the phone, the screen was constantly making a popping type noise due to the protector not actually touching the screen flush due to the tape/sticker that creates a gap. Also the touch screen didn't work as well unless you pressed harder. After an hour the protector just popped off. Tossed the second one that came with it in the garbage an ordered a different screen protector that's not glass.
POS 	Product failed at 12.5 months from purchase.
POS 	Fits well but does NOT stick. Only has adhesive around the edges. Once you think it’s on, one corner pops up and then causes the whole side to come off. Wish it would’ve had adhesive over the whole thing.
POS 	No stars. I barely had this year. Went to set it up this year and it does not work at all. Both blowups that I purchased from this company have been crappy and they are not cheap. Now this is no way to contact the seller?
POS 	tried it twice, same both times very unhappy
POS 	I AM NOT HAPPY WITH ONLY RECEIVING HALF OF THE PRODUCT. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!! WILL NEVER BUY FROM AGAIN.
POS 	Since I wrote the review following I have had nothing but troble. Phone keeps switching to Emergency Calls Only. Have taken it to my carrier 3 times and had the sim card replaced. Want to return this phone. Phone works well. My first smart phone and am still finding how things work. Charger that comes with it is for Europe and the promised adaptor did not come with it.
POS 	The material looks good from photo, but the quality is very bad, all tore up and broken in about a couple of months time.
POS 	Doesnt feel like a sony controller
POS 	Useless for your clit. Don't buy!
POS 	Wasn't able to use bluetooth while charging, which was the main idea behind trying this. Lots of interference. Returned.
POS 	Poor quality already broke
POS 	Terrible falls apart not good for small children. Zero stars would be more appropriate. Useless
POS 	Concept is great but the straps started peeling away after two uses. I would recommend the idea of this product however a different brand name.
POS 	The antenna is connected to two TV's one upstairs in the bedroom and one downstairs in the living room and both are "smart" TV's. Upstairs we get several channels with good picture quality; however, in the living room where we watch TV the most we only get two channels. We have repositioned the antenna several times with no change which is very frustrating. I sent an email to the company about my problem and after a week I still haven't had a response which isn't good customer service. ALSO, when we were running the supplied cable through the ceiling it pulled apart so we ended up using the existing cable we were using for my old bulky antenna which pulled in all the local channels. It's very disappointing that the new antenna doesn't pull in all the local channels where we sit to watch TV.
POS 	Missing second page ????
POS 	It was very small and it has leaks
POS 	I don't see the difference between this product as the regular socks you get at any other store
POS 	If I could give them a zero I would. Once the product came almost all of the figurines have defects. I contacted customer service and it took days to get a response but ultimately they wanted me to send photos, which I did, but they would only give me 10% of my money back. Which I never got and I told them I rather have a full refund and they can have their product but yet they told me no. So basically I wasted my money on a project that is now going in the garbage . Do not buy anything from this company. You have been warned!
POS 	Product did not work hard to use. You have to trim and doesn’t fit right. Not pleased
POS 	Broke in 2 as soon as I opened the package
POS 	My magnet won’t stay on to the iPad I’ve gone through both of the disk that they give you it won’t stays on.
POS 	What we ordered was a skip tooth blade but that was not what we received. The photos clearly show that there are no skipped tooth in this blade that we received.
POS 	After less than 4 months the band broke at the clasp
POS 	Bubblegum machine ring quality. One of the prongs was bent funny and blackened like it had fallen off and been reattached. Gross waste of money.
POS 	Too small should have ordered two sizes bigger
POS 	My American Bulldog chewed this toy for aggressive chewers apart in 10 minutes ☹️
POS 	the scarf is unraveling only done fully on one side
POS 	Disgusted and disgusting!!! Amazon sent me a pair of worn shoes. Not only were they worn, they still had skin residue inside!! ABSOLUTELY GROSS! The box was beaten to smithereens and even had a hole in it. The top was secured by a rubber band. I have had great experiences shoe shopping with Amazon in the past, but this order has me leary from ever purchasing shoes again. I would give it a -0 if I could!
POS 	Cheaply made, Poor construction. Bought this to have a small stroller on a family vacation to Disney. 2 different wheels broken after 2 days in the park. Tossed it in the dumpster and rented stroller the rest of the week. Do not buy....
POS 	This does not work properly. I gave it 1 stars only because clock works. It does not track steps correctly. After shopping yesterday it said I went 3 steps. Hello.........I would not recommend anyone purchasing this product if you want to track steps.
POS 	Significantly over priced due to the fact that this is 3$ in stores
POS 	The instructions were written by someone who can’t speak English. I was eventually able to figure out how to set the clock and alarm, but I haven’t been able to use the other features. I’m going to try Googling.
POS 	This watch is cheaply made, did not come with a sim card as described nor does it even have a slot to insert a sim card into! When I purchased it had a 4 star review which is why I said I would try it but now I see others are in the same position I am and my daughter will be without a gift for Christmas as I have already started processing my return. I guess Santa will have to leave an IOU for a decent watch now....very disappointed.
POS 	Upon first use, the part that attaches to a headphone jack broke off, and then my phone wouldn't charge through the other port either. What a waste of money!
POS 	One bag was about two months still in date, but the other bag was already expired by about a month. I purchased this at the end of April 2018.
POS 	Had these for about a month and all three have stopped working.
POS 	Item inside package was open and missing papers. I will not return item because it is to much trouble for a few missing sheets of paper. But I will not use this product or company again.
POS 	First time I used it, was in the airport leaving and the connector (gold part) that attaches the strap broke!!!! So disappointing because that's the very reason I ordered this one, was for the strap!
POS 	The purpose of buying these specific ones was because my daughter and I have a hard time finding the pacifier on the bed at night. I though this would solve the problem, but sure it did not.
POS 	After 1 week one of the light bulbs have already burned out.
POS 	I set this tablet up in the evening and in the morning, it wouldn't boot up. I had to reset it to default/factory setting to finally get it to work. The next day...same thing. When it works, the games are good and the screen, touch, and sound are fine but...doesn't matter if it never works. I am returning mine today.
POS 	They flip and not comfortable
POS 	This product was junk! Cheap quality and even felt a buzz when I put the batteries in. DO not waste your money.
POS 	Can't get past first level. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Same thing. Hope they fix this!! Especially since I paid for it!!!
POS 	The product was shipped in time, but not in tact. 4 out of 6 packages were crushed to almost dust and not edible. Makes for a very disappointing purchase.
POS 	Not quite what I wanted
POS 	I am really disappointed in this product after applying it to my phone. There are too vertical lines that go across the screen at the edges. The worst part though it the responsiveness of the screen now. I constantly have to touch things twice and some letters don't get picked up without hard presses multiple times. and swiping down from the top for the options is really annoying and unresponsive since the screen makes you unable to activate the touch response swipe mechanism.
POS 	Plugged my earbuds into the adapter and it didn’t play through the earbuds at all. Plugged it in and tried again but it did not work at all.
POS 	I can't believe this is broken. Very upset that it didn't last more than 2 seconds . Wow cheaply made.
POS 	To hard to put on by myself. Need help from someone else.
POS 	I generally only buy Maxboost screen protectors because they are easy to install and last a long time. While this may be true of this protector, the deal breaker was that the touch factor did not work. After installing it, only the pencil would work on my iPad 11”. Had to take it off and “eat” this expense. Maxboost, I’m disappointed. Don’t buy this screen protector until they solve the touch problem.
POS 	Stale, sent a note with no response. I asked for a refund or fresh replacement... please make this right.
POS 	The adhesive on this product will never allow it to be removed without significantly damaging whatever is below it. Unlike most phone screen protectors that peel right off if damaged or removed, this glue becomes one with its substrate. Now I have to look into replacing the display on a two month old car. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
POS 	Very frustrated with this product. It had high reviews which lead me to purchase this glue gun. Within the first 2 minutes of using it the gun clogged up. So I exchange it for a new one thinking maybe I had a defective gun. NOPE! The 2nd gun was even worse. Clogged up almost immediately. I followed the instructions, so I know it wasn’t anything I was doing wrong. If they could fix this issue on the glue gun I would say that this product is amazing, but as it is now it doesn’t do what it supposed to.
POS 	My first unit stopped playing discs of any kind and I sent it back to Sony, waited an interminable amount of time and got a supposedly new replacement. This replacement unit also crapped out about four months later and with the holidays, just swapped another Blu-Ray player into my system. And now, of course, Sony says that the original one-year warranty only dates from the ORIGINAL purchase date and not the replacement. So I'm out of luck. Looks like this in't an isolated issue. I'm shocked at the poor quality of a premium product, and done with Sony.
POS 	It is the shortest length of a chord I have ever seen. It’s not useable.
POS 	Maybe I have very thick hair, but it falls off and it does not dry my hair at all. It's not worth it.
POS 	The holes to hold the pumps are so far to the side that you can’t even pump. I’m very disappointed in this product 😢
POS 	It would be a great sharpener if it would not have broken so quickly. And it broke after I was unable to return it. It must not be a good design because it would have lasted much longer if it was built better.
POS 	while the size and style are great the door is poorly engineered...I didn't bother downloading an image of the broken off door because everyone before me already did and now I'm really wishing I had done more homework ahead of time via the feedback. Don't waste your money!
POS 	This was never received. Tracking said it eas delivered to my mailbox, but it was not in mine. Checked with the apt office & they haven't seen it, neither have neighbors with a mailbox close to mine. Please send a replacement. Said it was delivered Tuesday & it is Sunday. Still no Fiddler on the Roof.
POS 	Arrived with holes in two of the balloons, couldn't even use it.
POS 	It doesn't work with plug in Wi-Fi like a jet pack
POS 	Worst door knob ever! Do not buy!
POS 	Too small, can only submerge up to my pelvis and I'm 5ft 7 in
POS 	Milo says he didn't like it and wasn't interested in it at all. So back it when. Other cats may love it.
POS 	THIS FILAMENT is very messy and cheap it warps alot and it very stringy
POS 	I'm not a person who leaves bad reviews on products unless necessary. But this Juice from Raw tasted so gross to me. The Pine-Apple Mint was the only one I was able to drink. I felt like with the greens, I was literally eating grass. The Detox had to much dandelion in it for me. And I had to choke down the Sweet Greens. The spicey lemonade was too spicey for me. I am really disappointed in this Juice from Raw, I couldn't even get through one day! I would be returning this item if I could.
POS 	Unfortunately they didn’t work for me at all for they doesn’t work with soft tissue. My skin tissue is too soft and it won’t stay in place. So be careful unfortunately it won’t work for everyone. The firmer your skin is the better it may work.
POS 	The ball fell off within the first week. Super disappointed 😔
POS 	There was a small hole right around neck area I noticed when took out of the bag. Keeping because I don't want to bother with return process. Definitely not satisfied with this product.
POS 	I ordered this thinking I could fit my laptop charger and cable inside, along with a phone charger, but I couldn’t fit it all inside. The picture shows a lot in the pouch but no way. I couldnt even close mine. Returned because it also had a WEIRD STRONG smell that would t go away!
POS 	Fast shipping, But cheap packaging, lots of bubbles despite following the cleaning and installation instructions. pixelated 3D screen, also appears rainbow like when I use it in the car while wearing my sunglasses. I do not recommend this product.
POS 	Like a dozen of videos and that’s it
POS 	Doesn’t work. I wanted a more natural alternative but after several uses (following the directions) my drain still drains slowly. Haven't noticed any improvement.
POS 	Piece of crap! After two days the cable began to fray, before I could write a complaint I got a generic email stating that it has that tendency in "small" yards. I live on ten acres and it still frayed... don't waste your money.
POS 	How come u guys say that this will fot an audi a5 but it doesnt ? This is ridiculous
POS 	NOT tempered glass as it says in the description. This is going back. Very disappointed.
POS 	One star for the inadequacies of the seller/people who pick their items in the warehouse. I ordered this in a C cup and received it in a D cup. No big deal- I simply returned and reordered. Second time I order it in a C cup, I get a D cup. Again. There’s no place to contact the seller to explain that they keep sending me the wrong size so I’m at a loss. Returning and buying elsewhere.
POS 	Name says that it fits Rtic tumbler but is to small for their 30oz.
POS 	The seat cover back wore thru within two weeks of installation
POS 	My child loved these shoes. Wore them around the house to make sure they fit before a beach trip. First time wearing them outside velcro that is stitched on pulled off when taking them off to dump sand out of them. Useless.
POS 	Got banned and not sure why support is not responding.
POS 	Balls didn’t thread properly. Returning both sizes I purchased.
POS 	I hate giving a negative review, but this product simply did not work for me at all. I tried it on two occasions, and after the first occasion was a failure, on the 2nd occasion liberally sprayed 7 pump sprays under each arm for a thorough soaking. In both cases early in the day I discovered it was not working at all. That is, I smelled my own body odor. Not good.
POS 	Ph reader continuously fluctuates even after calibrating, and is often wrong. Really cheap.
POS 	Arrived broken. Returned item.
POS 	Vendor shipped the wrong cover. it's not for the kindle I bought, it's for the oder model. I bought with the Kindle at the same time. That means vendor made the mistake.
POS 	OK knife. The packaging SUCKS! The blade was sticking out of the envelope 3” + or -. Almost cut the crap out of myself reaching into my mailbox.
POS 	Very disappointed had a large hole in the side of it where it was never sewn together. Quality control ? Not to mention this item had already been sent back once because the return label from the previous return was in the taped up bag with the dress. Quality control failed twice. Both on the manufacturers end and Amazons end.
POS 	Never received the lights. Email said they were undeliverable? Which is odd because i received other packages from Amazon that day and someone was home all day. Ill look elsewhere.
POS 	This item arrived in the mail a MESS! When I opened the package, I stuck my hand into goo. Not only was the lid not screwed on properly, but the container was actually cracked! See pictures! And it says “no returns”. It’s unusable! All of the liquid is in the envelope or dripping off the bottle
POS 	These clips broke very fast after being used for only a few times. Snagged my hair where it cracked.
POS 	This backpack is a fake. The material is not as nice as it seems. It crinkles when you move with it, not to mention that is was dirty when I received it. The straps are unable to be made longer and it is very small. It has frayed strings from the stitching. I can barely fit anything inside of it either. The pockets on the side have barely any space in them and laptop pocket is tiny. I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU BUT THIS PRODUCT.
POS 	This is nothing like the picture. Wings on the front, doesn't fit or hang anything like shown. Very odd shaped. Sent back.
POS 	Maybe it's a fake that someone else returned, not an Apple product, but a Chinese brand.
POS 	I didn't work at all!
POS 	Doesn’t work at all.
POS 	Unfortunately on the first use, popcorn went everywhere. Gave it another go, and even more unfortunately on the second use (one week later), the machine burnt the popcorn!
POS 	I made somewhere between 35 and 50 fabric cuts using this mat and it's not self healing. It also totally dulled 2 rotary cutter blades. It's being returned. I don't recommend it.
POS 	Order lost in transit, not Amazon’s fault. No follow up. Could not get an answer. Very disappointed. Had to last minute order a different product with colors not same color palette.
POS 	It arrived broken! :(
POS 	NOT a rat sized house!! Mouse sized...not rat
POS 	Leaves my hair feeling like crunchy straw
POS 	Used this diaper for 1 night and here’s the result! Makes me so angry when I spend my time looking for something that should be natural and better for my child and I end up with this. Seems to me honest company isn’t very honest. Do not buy this
POS 	I have never received this product! Amazon never delivered it. Amazon acknowledged that it was lost in delivery. I want the product, I have paid for the product. I want answers, deliver it, or give me credit.
POS 	Does NOT look like the picture by any means. The picture looks as though it is an even cut; nope. When on, the front is cut shorter; you cannot pull off the style in the picture. Then it is cut in a slant (almost asymmetrical cut). You will have to cut it, I wasn’t expecting this and I am upset about that. I had always been looking for a simple cut but, yeah, not here. There is also a mound that forms on the top where it would need to be thinned out. Overall, I am disappointed.
POS 	I had no problem when I bought the same plant before from them so this time I ordered 3 more. 2 we're gifts and one for me. Hopefully the gifts looked better than mine. Mine has some sort of holes in the trunk. I don't know why. The top is turning yellow and slowly looking worse. The holes remind me of when you are pealing a potato and it has the bad spot so you dig it out with the peeler. That's what they look like. I wrote to the company and complained and got no response at all. I already replanted it in a expensive ceramic larger pot and it looks aweful. I am really disappointed and hope the other ones didn't look like this!
POS 	Don't buy!! This thing is always dead. I charge it and it works, then turn it off, the next time I go to use it, it's dead and doesn't turn on until another charging. Piece of junk, how does it die when the thing is off??!!
POS 	I taught it was the Do si dos last year. It is current cookies sold this year. I could have purchased from a Girl Scout cheaper
POS 	I have been using the case for less than a month now, and the rose gold paint is already peeling off. This is my third Spigen case because I normally love your brand, but this is very disappointing!
POS 	I bought this 2 pack and only received the skeleton shirt? Not the jack-o-lantern?
POS 	Would not recommend. The luggage broke on my wife's very first flight using it. She then had to scramble in a foreign country trying to find a replacement for her return home. Picture attached.
POS 	Package never showed up at my door but says it was delivered an hour after I updated the delivery option because you couldnt get in the front door. And there's no option to let anyone know I never got it
POS 	POS! Used it twice and now the network cable tester always shows cable fail. Probe shows conductors 4 and 5 bad. The scanner shows only conductor 5 is bad. Tried two known to be good cables. It only cost $20.00 but it should work longer than two uses. At $20.00 it's not worth the trouble to return it. In the garbage it goes!
POS 	I never received it...I got a message that the box was torn and unable to deliver...and I have yet to receive it...
POS 	Not very happy with this item, ordered 1 and they sent 2 and charged for 2 for starters, it’s not bright, no back light, I’m just not happy!!!!!
POS 	Horrible! The plastic backing is not sticky at all so it will not weed. The entire roll is wasted.
POS 	I read a lot of good reviews on Calphalon pans, so I wanted to give it a try. I thought maybe getting a little expensive pan (it was $39 when i got it) means that it will last longer, but it didn't. I was hoping for a pan that would last at least 3 years, but this lasted less than 8 months. I am very disappointed. I don't really recommend it. For a pan that will last less than a year, get something cheaper.
POS 	The head stand doesn't fit ANY of my wig heads and is not sturdy
POS 	I’m not sure if the bottle we got was a lemon but this sunscreen didn’t protect our skin at all!!! Beware and try out before relying on it! We tried it twice, on different people and on different days and both times our skin turned red and burned within 10-15 minutes out in the sun. Luckily we noticed before completely hurting our skin. We applied just like our other non-chemical sunscreen which protected us well so this is not a user error. Very frustrating! Especially since we had bought it for our long vacation and thus ended up in Europe without a functioning non-chemical sunscreen. And now the return window is closed... I really wanted to like this sunscreen. The consistency is just a little bit thinner than the brands we usually use.
POS 	Got these for my puppy so she could chew. If I put peanut butter on it, all she does is lick it of, then won't have anything to do with the bones. Disappointed.
POS 	I have had this cutting board for less than one month. Today it just spontaneously broke in half and is now useless.
POS 	All these adapter are junk and unusable. They create hissing and popping. Horrible quality. The only good thing is when I asked for a refund and they wasted in refunding my money and I did not need to return them. They all went in the trash.
POS 	Terrible... I painted my nails and my friends and the next day they were all bubbles and started peeling day 2. I am returning
POS 	Bought trying to extend my wi-fi but this thing fails miserably. My existing router reaches farther.
POS 	I really like the brand and we regularly give it. In fact, I've purchased other bulk items from Hubbard in the past, and still have a bit of the peanut butter cookies to go through, that I had purchased 20lbs of in the past. With this being a variety pack, I thought it would be even better. And they wouldn't get as tired of it, as they did with the PB box. But the dogs all looked at me, as though I was threatening to beat them. And our Black Lab... Which I honestly cannot remember when he's EVER turned down anything offered to him to eat. Perhaps they were starting to go rancid??? Though I couldn't smell anything. But I know with dry food, once it is exposed to oxygen, it starts going rancid within 2 weeks. Which is why I only keep out enough for a little over a week, then freeze the rest. I don't know if everyone else's came like mine. But the giant bag it all came in, was open, thus exposed to oxygen. Anyway, with none of the dogs wanting to eat it, I have no choice but to return. And since it's the 20lb box, inside of ANOTHER box... What a pain. lol
POS 	Arrived with a giant hole in the side. They missed the seam while sewing it. Was too late to send it back since I didn't open it until it was time to take my tree down.
POS 	I bought this product, but I didn’t receive
POS 	I will be returning it as soon as I order a replacement. Keeps going to blue screen. Constantly having to reset it. Going to look for another brand
POS 	Incredibly too small. I honestly thought they sent me a children's size instead. Nope, just way too small.
POS 	These are worthless.....They flicker on low setting for microwave light......DO NOT buy if you need to use them on low setting!!!!!
POS 	Didnt receive this order
POS 	Don't waste your money.. This my third one for the month.. if you accidentally drop it.. your phone will get out of the case and still get damaged.. My last one dropped from chair height and broke... broke my iPhone 8+ back glass.. $ 99 repair....smh... so I was like let me test the last good piece .. drop it from 2 feet on the glass and it broke... it looks good when it new., but you absolutely can not drop it or you screwed.. would not recommend this , would not even use it if I get it for free... lol can send you picture if you like..
POS 	Warming function was horrid, returned it.
POS 	The cord broke last week. Tried to write review. But it wouldn't go thru. Over all I like the light board.got it for my paint with diamonds. Just can't use it now.
POS 	This stuff is so bitter and the powder is brown, can’t even taste the goodness of green tea. Yuck, no idea how there are any good reviews.
POS 	When I got the package it was missing several sets of earrings.
POS 	I couldn't use the volume control on my phone to play my music
POS 	It would not cut through a watermelon
POS 	Do NOT buy these!!! First, they’re not compatible with iPhones. It’ll work for a minute and then a message will pop up on your phone saying “accessory not supported.” What’s even worse, they broke and now part of it is stuck in my phone! This was under an hour of my first time using them! Don’t waste your money.
POS 	I own a lot of lingerie from high end pieces to $10 rip them and leave them things. This is hands down the worse product I’ve ever purchased. Not worth it, flimsy, just...a poorly made product. Avoid.
POS 	About 45 days after receiving the blanket control melted. This item is a fire hazard
POS 	The color bleeds through all paper, even heavy paper, and the colors are not at all as pictured or described on the end. I would return them, but Amazon says it's ineligible.
POS 	They have different sizes listed for this projector stand the shortest one is too short to use
POS 	While the box is solid and arrived promptly there was nothing either to attached or already to installed that allows you to hang the files. You know, the reason why I purchased the box
POS 	I waited until when she said it was free and still got charged without my knowledge until later! I got ripped off! I WILL FILE A COMPLAINT IF I AM NOT REFUNDED IMMEDIATELY!
POS 	The laptop fits great for my business usage, but unfortunately i'll end up returning it and picking another brand due to the very poor screen brightness, I never had a Lenovo before and this one will prevent me from getting another. I've never seen a screen so limited in brightness even in cheaper computers.
POS 	Product had damage to exterior of casing due to poor packaging. Product was missing the power cord. I would have attempted to see if it was functional despite the damage, but I could not power up the unit due to the missing cord. Returning.
POS 	After two weeks this completely stopped working. Would not reccomend buying this.
POS 	I RECEIVED SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SENT TO SOMEONE ELSE. WHAT DO I DO?
POS 	I have not received my order and the seller isn’t responding .
POS 	They were good for about a week. Then the material started to fall apart.
POS 	Smells bad and one end doesn’t stick to the tub!..I think because the way it was rolled up. Returning this!
POS 	Well they say this is the large size. I find that hard to believe. Very uncomfortable trying to get it on even with plenty of water based lubricant! Instructions are vague and it did absolutely nothing for me. After pushing several different buttons I found out it wanted to clamp on to my tool. Pushed some more buttons and had the headset on and discovered the not so pleasant "moans" or whatever you wish to call it! Those considering this...look elsewhere! I wish I had!
POS 	Received product. It did not work. Sent back.
POS 	I made an order on August 30th for a book needed for a college class for my son. The second week of September I still had not received it so my son had to purchase the book online elsewhere. I went online to cancel the order. I also called to cancel the order and spoke to Ann. She said the order had not shipped yet but it was too late to cancel the order. She said to refuse the box and I told her no one would be there to refuse it. She said she would contact the carrier and cancel it, that she would call me back the next day to be in a conference call in order to do that. She never called me back. I also paid extra to have expedited shipping. I am disappointed to say the least.
POS 	Not as originally described
POS 	This was a gift for my wife. I don't know why she likes this movie, but she does. I was a fan of Steve Martin in the 70s, when he did stand-up and was on SNL. I am certainly not a fan anymore. Remake after remake, his performances fall short. In my humble opinion, as a performers he "plays it safe." He's not going to do so on my dime. Remakes for the most part are slop, with no originality. Remakes are a testimony to the fact that no one reads anymore and therefore are uninspired to come up with ideas of their own. Mr. Martin leads the pack in that category. Shame on him.
POS 	I bought this a while ago put it straight in storage never opened it until today delivered it to my new apartment opened it up and there is NO LEGS to the bottom of the couch, trying to find a way to contact someone to get the bottom leg braces for it
POS 	I ordered the "one size" and it's an XL. It's too big so I'm confused why the one size is an XL when there is a plus size option. My waist is a 40" and stomach 33". It doesn't feel supportive enough.
POS 	after only two months, the outside handle on the bag broke!! This is shoddy work and a waste of money.
POS 	The item did not work at all. I placed into 3 different computers and none of them was able to connect to the net. Even after going online to get the software that was posted they still never worked. Not even worth sending back I just threw them out.
POS 	Heart rate monitor was 40-50 point off consistently.
POS 	I put them in a high quality pair of Clarks. The original insoles are not removable so adding these bulky gel insoles made these loose shoes way too tight to wear. Don't buy unless you can remove the insoles hat came with your shoes.
POS 	I bought this product for my Iphone to be able to charge my phone and use my headphones at the same time. I plugged my headphones up and they do not work when I facetime at all, I thought maybe I had a defective product so I ordered a new one and it does the exact same thing. It also charges very slow. Clearly this product does not serve its purpose.
POS 	The part that mounts to the cat broke off
POS 	I got it blew it up it went flat it must have a small hole somwhere came like that smh
POS 	The capsules have a strong taste of plastic. Not the same capsules I previously purchased from seller.
POS 	Dislike this bottle so damn much. It was recommended in a YouTube video so I bought it. Worst $20 bucks of my life. Lid doesn’t close and has spilled and the speaker is messed up.
POS 	These are not a good point, not good color, and definitely not worth the money.
POS 	I very seldom complain about products. But this item is worthless. I used the real deal Jade East in my youth. This is NOT the original product. This jade east is not same color nor is the scent. Original had a dark mossy color and long lasting scent. This stuff dissipates within 15 min. A waste of money
POS 	This is a 50" tv not a 55" I contacted seller and they offered me $40.00 off. $40.00 off is a joke on 5" different size TV. They know they have listed it wrong but still haven't changed their description. Customer service is horrible.
POS 	If I could give no stars I would. The lights didn’t light up, but if you turn it on the battery pack heats up like crazy. Even if they worked, the batteries got hot way too fast. I’m extremely disappointed.
POS 	the picture clearly shows a labeled item and what i received appears to be a cheap knockoff. the stand will barely "stand" by itself much less with a camera on it. i have another one that is clearly much better and will support a camera. this was a waste of money will try a different vendor.
POS 	light on mine came jammed doesnt work at all and compass never faces north and whistle sucks. it dose sharpen somewhat if your in a jam . i think the ferro rod is the best part of this whole setup. not worth the money i paid for it
POS 	After receiving this item, I selected English as the language, and then plugged it in to charge overnight. When I came back in the morning, it was in Chinese - And now I can't get it back to English. Any suggestions? I'll revise my review if someone out there can help me...
POS 	Definitely NOT noise canceling. The bud part is so big it barely fits in my ear and I've never had the problem with any other headphones.
POS 	Returned and again was shipped with a smaller size. Dont order!
POS 	I am very disappointed with this product, the touch doesn't work well, and the crash the same day arrived !
POS 	Open the box to find the plastic at the bottom of one of the bags shattered and useless. I figure these things happen and ill just return it for another. NOPE... They don't take return or exchanges for any reason what so ever. That some pretty shady stuff right there. I am upset with you amazon, how could you let something like this happen?
POS 	Cheaply constructed. The welds came loose and the cutting blade broke loose from the shaft after just a few uses.
POS 	Wrong item was sent and I can’t complete it. Hoping I can get the correct peice sent to me.
POS 	does not work except on only one of my phones (a Nexus) and will not work on charging tablets.Returned it
POS 	It was the perfect switch until they put out a firmware update. It originally had a green nightlight that lit up the switch and also showed it was connected to WiFi. After updating no more green light. I called amazon and Manufacturer. Have yet to hear back.
POS 	Junk bag fell apart after 2 weeks. See picture, The crazy thing is I just saw these at DOLLAR TREE for $1
POS 	Almost half of these had opened so I spent an hour before service distinguishing which ones I had to throw away and which ones were still usable and then cleaning the sticky off of the usable ones.
POS 	The package was empty!!!!!! It said it weighed one pound and was empty.
POS 	It was great at first. However after about three months, I notice the performance was becoming poorer by the day. The water pressure is good for about one week with new batteries then very weak. I tried different types of batteries, always same outcome. So I bought rechargeable batteries to use. But after another 10 months, the waterpick stopped working all together.
POS 	Ordered red and black, sent black and black. Sold out of red and black so couldn’t even get the right ones
POS 	OK UPDATED REVIEW NECK RATTLES I ASSUME FROM CRAPPY CHINA MADE DEAD FRETS UNFORTUNATLY I ALREADY INVESTED A TON OF TIME ON THE FOLLOWING; CLEAR COATS PRO FRET JOB, LEVELED SHAPED AND POLISHED. CHANGED OUT THE NUT DRILLED AND ADDED TUNERS WHICH WON'T FIT WITHOUT RE-DRILLING! SHAPED HEAL EO FIT POCKET WHICH IT WON'T WITHOUT WORK.
POS 	One of the bottles was broken when I opened the box. Leaked all over the other items in the box
POS 	They are just as expected, great value
POS 	So just received my jar and we were looking forward to try their tea. Not organic as advertised. A huge disappointment
POS 	Doent work for video.
POS 	One of the handles broke off the first time using it. Cheap quality.
POS 	I needed a new travel mirror. This one broke on my first trip. I travel for work weekly and have never had this issue with my other mirror. The case is of poor quality and feels cheap. Don’t waste money on this.
POS 	My problem with this product is the amount of oil,it was to much for me.
POS 	Purchased in May 2017, used once per week on kitchen floor and it has now stopped working. Unit will not turned on and I can not find any troubleshooting information online. I would not recommend anything that lasts six months with light usage.
POS 	Did not work for Shih Tsu dry eyes
POS 	Didn't last 4 months...
POS 	So super upset! I bought this and got 6 pairs of gold hoops. Not at all the style I ordered. I am super sad and would never order again for. This company
POS 	One of the connections does not work. Returning the product
POS 	These pouches are difficult to zipper close, difficult to clean and do not hold as much food as expected. In addition, the product came damaged (one of the zippers was broken). Was sad this product did not live up to it's potential.
POS 	Instructions for calibration were a little confusing, but after a few tries I was finally able to figure it out. After that, it worked great for 2 months then would no longer turn on, even with fresh batteries.
POS 	Do not buy. It breaks down within a year. There is a persistent problem of 5G disappearing or reconnecting.
POS 	This case does NOT fit the Kindle 8. The headphone jack does not line up and when the case is on the Kindle, it causes it to go into reset mode.
POS 	This cutter does not cut straight lines. Even if I use a T-square to make the paper perfectly straight, it will not cut straight, because the cut is curvy, rather than straight. The blade pulls the paper left and right as it cuts downward. I'm going back to my Fiskars paper cutter.
POS 	If you want to watch a film about a writer who finds the cause of her agoraphobia through encounters with a weird fan who never does anything but look scary plus three characters that seem to morph around blowing her mind. It was intense enough to cause me to watch it to the end, which never resolved anything that caused me to watch it in the first place. I felt cheated outta my nickle.
POS 	These are too small but the quality is good
POS 	Complete waste of money and a useless product. Did not take away or even lessened the smell in diaper genie.dont buy it.
POS 	I bought this set but it’s missing the kneaded eraser that was mentioned in the title, description, and pictured. This was primarily the reason I bought this item and I’m pretty pissed actually
POS 	I did not receive my liner with this product :( Other than that its a good product.
POS 	Half of the wooden dowels broke while trying to align them during assembly. Looks pretty in photos but the materials are the absolute cheapest. I doubt it is capable of handling any significant twisting when being moved about.
POS 	Do not buy this item. It works fine for a few days then it starts to slide all over the tub when you step on it. My wife is handicap and we bought it thinking it would help her get in and out the tub without sliding but it does not hold suction as promised and is misleading when it says it stays in place, safe etc..... Dont risk sliding and falling do not buy this.
POS 	I really do like their other products, their face cream, and their body creams are great, which is why I thought I would try their face cleanser but it is just terrible. It is thin and very watery, it leaves my face dry and tight feeling and worst of all is the smell. It smells like the stuff they use to clean rest stop bathrooms, I'm just going to throw it away. I really didn't want to give it any stars at all.
POS 	I think that it looks very cheap and I do not like it.
POS 	I can not comprehend how “experts” lauded this mishmash of nonsense as groundbreaking and insightful. I can only guess that someone influential lauded the author as being brilliant and the sheep followed. Perhaps it is brilliant because he is dead. Either way it is neither I intelligent nor intelligible. Over rated crap
POS 	Too much hair at the top, not enough in the back. Can see the wig threads and it’s cheaply put together. I’ve bought cheap wigs before and they weren’t as awful as this one.
POS 	You should have told me that one of the tubes had a hole in it.
POS 	Too hard to open Not gonna Work for me
POS 	The wire on one side broke right after I took it out of the pack. I was very disappointed. I sent it back and got a refund.
POS 	Irritates my eyes, makes them watery and blurs vision.
POS 	I bought it for my nephew to use it at the hospital but yoh could barely see any veins through it! It's not worth it at all
POS 	This product did not work, the files it produced were corrupted and not readable by any program. Makes me wonder if the positive reviews were real, I don't know how anyone could use this.
POS 	The machine was working well until it literally fell apart while it was eat to 300 degrees and while I was using it. The plate almost fell on my foot and I had to jump away quickly now the machine will not heat up without making this annoying constant beeping sound! Very upset!
POS 	Quantity ordered was 3 and I only received 1. Please send the other 2 blades or refund for the additional 2 blades.
POS 	The headphones broke after not even a week of using them.
POS 	They sent me two of the same colors 😢, please note they do not send all colors in the picture
POS 	It does not work as claimed or shown in the video. The screen door still slams. Complete waste of effort.
POS 	This filter is not a genuine Fram filter as it says it's made in China. Unfortunately I did not open box until it was too late to return.
POS 	Flimsy, too small, very disappointing.
POS 	This product has worked glitchy, it locks up and when it does work it is slow. I would not recommend it.
POS 	Junk.... chipped out of the box and more defects
POS 	This item is cheaply made, and broke after only a few months. The truck comes off the light easily, as well. It's too bad, because it'd be a nice product, otherwise.
POS 	Well i would love to provide a review but I never recieved this item or a refund. I contacted the seller after 3 weeks of waiting and instead of answering where the item was, they just cancelled the order without a refund. BEWARE THIS SELLER!! As far as I can tell, this is just a thief with a storefront. If you are of the mind to just give money away for no reason then hit me up...lord knows I could use the extra income! Lol
POS 	Looked very cheap and had a very chemical smell
POS 	I know that loading these things can be a mess at times, but this one takes the cake. this seems to get air bound very easy and is hard to get the air pocket out. I would not buy this again.
POS 	The quality was quite cheap and I was double charged for this order! Not worth purchasing.
POS 	First, these refills would not fit into my Revlon eyelash curler. It's a standard metal one-nothing fancy. These refills are way to thick to fit. I used pliers to open up the curler area and to make the refill fit. I rigged it well enough but the refills are way too squishy as in my eye lashes the curler is unable to hold my lashes. A complete waste of time and money. In addition, I ruined my perfectly functioning eye lash curler to try to get the squishy eye lash curler refills to fit. These refills were comparable to using a sponge to curl eyelashes. Ugh!!!!!!!!!!! I did not want to give this product any stars but had to to be able to submit the review!
POS 	These are to small for my shoes
POS 	Ordered 2 of the Shoreline Marine 800 GPH Bilge Pump with Auto Switch. Fortunately, I tested one before removal and installation. Water only drains down to 1.5 inches, leaving the bilge wet. No float adjustment. If any water drains back through the hose, it will cycle constantly. No instructions - only a wire diagram.
POS 	I just got permanent retainers on upper and lower teeth. Bought Super Floss and found the plastic threader is so flimsy and bends, I can’t get it through the teeth. I tried the floss on teeth without the retainers and it shreds leaving fibers stuck in the teeth, cuts into my fingers and between some teeth won’t even slide down. Want a refund!
POS 	I saw the reviews and took a gamble anyway since some people said it worked for them and was a genuine Samsung charger that has fast charging. I wanted another charger in the house. I just got it. Plugged it in to my S8+ and no fast charge. Tried my off-brand charger and the charger that came with my S8+ and those both worked just fine for fast charging. This charger is probably a genuine Samsung charger but it's not the one that can be used for S8+ fast charging. Complete waste of money!
POS 	Very disappointed came with broken leg.
POS 	cute shoes but way to wide for my narrow feet
POS 	Terrible leash... broke within a few weeks of having. Could be very dangerous if we had been on the road.
POS 	went up in smoke first use.
POS 	Cheap product. You get what you pay for. I lost my Fitbit because the clasp is so flimsy, I only had it on for 20 minutes before it completely came apart.
POS 	Cheap looking and dull.
POS 	didn't work at all and I bought two
POS 	Very poor quality. One broke during the 1st time playing .
POS 	As all the other reviews state, this is just an awful english dub that completely ruins the atmosphere.
POS 	Really bad product. The sides did not stick, the screen protector left a haze and the quality overall was bad
POS 	This is the worst thing I ever bought from amazon. It's mask was of mediocre quality, the plastic started melting away. And to top all that internal wiring seemed to have been short circuiting or something and after a strange sound, the whole thing stopped working. Worst of all, no return policy.
POS 	I held mine up to my vehicle upon receiving. It’s obvious it would’ve been a poor fit had I tried to apply them. Edges aren’t painted black and while it would be hard to see this once applied it wouldn’t be impossible- just kinda feels like they cut one too many corners
POS 	I don't do presentations every day, or even every week or month, so I thought with a nice review, most people getting the issues they had rectified, that this would be a great purchase. After 1 use, and a battery change to make sure that wasn't the issue, when I plug the USB dongle into the computer and turn it on it just flashes green once for any button I press. It will not connect with the computer, and the the laser pointer doesn't even work which would at least give me some use with my pets. This is a YMMV type of purchase it seems.
POS 	The jewelry did not come with my order and the cigarette holder was broken.
POS 	This did not include the Dyson adapter as stated in the description.
POS 	Not sure what happened. Product shows shipped 18 days ago and has not arrived. It appears that the amount has been refunded, so I believe they cancelled the order.
POS 	It didn’t fit and it was a little torn
POS 	Ordered four men XL t shirts and received four YOUTH XL LONG SLEEVE shirts. Reordered them and the same thing happen. Really inconvenient.
POS 	This item is POOR quality. First of all, the needle does not stay in place because the screw doesn't tighten enough in order to do that. Secondly, the embroidery floss is lousy. Lastly, the padded grip on mine was so scuffed up it looked either used OR old. Oh, and those directions in the package, guess what? Those are for a completely different needle and the product pictured in those directions is not the product you will be looking at. The hand needles included, those are tapestry and yarn needles. Those will do you NO good for hand embroidery. The embroidery floss cards included are far to tiny to do anything with, they are about 1/3 the size of a regular embroidery floss card. Thinking of buying this? Don't even bother.
POS 	It shows that my phone was delivered I have been waiting all day to receive this package even payed extra to receive today because I was going to send I to my mother as a gift for her birthday. This needs to be fixed please. I have been waiting and waiting and been tracking the delivery and it shows delivered but my item is not here.
POS 	Failed in less than a month. Previous WD My Passport drive failed in less than a year.
POS 	this plate works great though for a very limited time - we've had it for about 3 months and it's no longer usable. like other reviewers have mentioned, regardless of how we're washing it (hand washing w/minimal soap or running it through the dishwasher) it retains an overwhelming smell of soap that departs the taste on anything placed on the plate. its disgusting and given that I would never eat off of it, I definitely won't be letting my 1 year old use. it.
POS 	The reason I purchased a shield was how small and concealable it is. Figured this holster would be a great cheap addition to my collection. It was definitely cheap. I was really surprised at how wide this made my pistol feel. I would not recommend this to anyone. The cheap uncle mikes Walmart special did a much better job.
POS 	Waste of money. Freezing phone while case was charging. Could see the call coming but would not answer. The QI stopped working just days aftet the return date ran out. Not worth it.
POS 	I have had this unit for almost a year connected to Comcast. I have repeated drops and lag related to the modem. A serious waste of money.
POS 	Lasted less than 3 months
POS 	It doesn't work!!!!!!
POS 	No where on the package or on the glove does it say leather. Just China. Someone needs to confirm this claim that it is Italian leather . And I will retract this review. Help Amazon
POS 	The product does not work with iPhones at all.
POS 	I used them one time and pulled them out of my phone and wire went everywhere and now they do not work. Biggest waste of money and would cost me more to send back.
POS 	I got 2 gig wax 18oz and received it today and it was 14oz I didn need the 14oz
POS 	The picture I took from this camera is worse than my Iphone 4. It's so blurred. I tried to adjust to the highest resolution and with the macro len but still worse than Iphone 4. I can't even read all the text
POS 	Only lasted 2 weeks. Had 2 of them outside on my porch pointed at my glow in the dark skeleton and snake. Bugs got into the lights and caused them not to work. Definitely not for outside use.
POS 	Poorly made. Did not stick to the watch. Became instantly foggy. Save your money. Buy a different protector.
POS 	The white lights stopped working on the third night.
POS 	Well I received this product Monday, it’s friday and won’t turn on anymore. It was wonderful for 4 days, but like I didn’t spend 30-40 bucks on this for it to stop working. I’d like my money back, considering my old heating pad lasted 3 years.
POS 	Gloves are very large, stiff and cumbersome. Unable to gently lift corals. Gloves will not air out and as a result they always smell. Not a good glove to use for reef tanks.
POS 	when i got my light the wire thing that holds the batteries in was broken,Not a happy person
POS 	Horrible tool. Went to loosen a bolt and the head of the tool broke.
POS 	Very poor quality. No suction
POS 	This disgusting, worthless garbage only supports Windows 10. Do not buy it.
POS 	It does not make me sweat the way sweet sweat does. I haven’t seen any difference from wearing it and not wearing it
POS 	Never received the product what a big scam
POS 	My husband bought this for my Birthday the end of January. By mid-March we had already had one light go out. The lights are hard to position over multiple plants or seedling.
POS 	Two bags leaked as soon as I went to fill them. The company is being less than helpful and make it difficult to get replacements. I won’t go through the hassle of boxing up trash. I feel as if they don’t believe me. Amazon has been less than helpful as well. Do yourself a favor and buy better ones
POS 	Envelope showed up empty
POS 	It wasn't until I had the lock installed that I discovered none of the keys that came with it fit the lock.
POS 	I ordered 50, but only received a case of 25.
POS 	Book was sold as new; however, is was clearly used as all the pages are bent over and the book format looks terrible.
POS 	Super disappointed We bought this for my sons birthday and it came opened with tape around it the product looks like trash. Now we will not even be able to give it to him for his birthday. Was really looking forward to this.
POS 	Ordered 8 cans 26 Feb then 2 March notified it was returned to sender with no reason given; very bad customer service. Guess I will go to Wal-Mart if Amazon can't get their stuff together!
POS 	staying in hk and got the V6 in dec 2017 (9 months up till now), stopped working since last week with LED flashing red for more than 12 times. cannot get local support. is the US manufacturing still supporting the product (maybe send me a new battery, sth along that line?) if not, i'll have no choice but to sell it at very low price to local dealers. will consider switching to other brands. hope to get feedback asap.
POS 	Does not work amazon needs to remove this product!!!!!
POS 	Metal edges were rough and was snagging my fabric. The screw heads twisted right off as I was installing the bracket. Not happy.
POS 	Does not work. Very disappointed. Tried to return. Gave me wrong return label. Still sitting there.
POS 	I just got them today, and haven’t had a chance to install them they seem like pretty good hinges and the self closing mechanism works well. BUT the screws are too long and will go right threw my solid oak cabinets. I wish they would give you the option to select shorter screws. Now that I have to go to the hardware store and buy 100 pairs of new screws it makes this purchase more expense then the list price
POS 	It was fantastic until it broke. And it broke within TWO WEEKS of my purchase for no reason. It charged really well and you could listen to wired headphones with it, but it's not worth it if it just breaks. DON'T BUY THIS.
POS 	They looked great, but were too small. I had to send them back.
POS 	I have worn these shoes two times and the stitching is completely coming apart.
POS 	Worked for about a week.
POS 	didnt work at all slide all over very uncomfortable...
POS 	Very disappointed in this product. First off the setup is that of nightmares and only works about half of the time. Also the camera never stays online and constantly disconnects from the Wi-Fi. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
POS 	I could not get the center to stick. It was not a bubble, it just would not stick to the entire screen.
POS 	Called the company multiple times, left voicemail and have yet to even get to talk to someone, plants came dead, horribly water logged,
POS 	Not what I ordered! I ordered a new sealed 7 book set. I receiver 1 used written in book marked on clearance for $.50
POS 	I ordered the pack was defective. I looks like you and plug you cellphone in on the side of the bag, but my bag didn’t have anything to plug into. Charging port is missing
POS 	I never received the item.
POS 	Great cd! My kind of music!
POS 	Normally I buy thistle from Walmart but they were out of stock for a few weeks so I ordered this product. I use socks and finches in my yard typically devour thistle like crazy until I bought this product. Cleaned socks and refilled and also tried using in a flat bird feeder and they still would not eat it. Once Walmart obtained inventory I bought it, dumped the Pennington seed and replaced with Walmart product. Birds are again happy feeders Pennington seed now in garbage.
POS 	Too expensive very cheaply made plastic
POS 	Ordered and double checked the order because I didn't like the way it did not call out exact size in shipping list. it says S-XXL, I actually triple checked and made sure that I ordered a XXL for my wife, and a L, for my daughter RECIEVED a Medium and a Large. DID NOT ORDER A MEDIUM. I was extremely leary and should have followed my better judgement when I could not see the ACTUAL size in my cart just the S-XXL... and my gut feeling was correct so now have a jacket for my daughter that is too tight and have to hassle with return or whatever...
POS 	I just had a customer return the candle because the wick sticker lifted and floated to the top of the candle!!!!
POS 	The screen protector kit I received was in total disarray. The screen protectors were out of their protective shields with no adhesive to attach them to the camera. The wiping clothes when opened were totally dried out, no instructions include, ect. Bad experience, not recommended.
POS 	Not a big fan they super greasy and cones right off. Have to keep reapplying .
POS 	These were impossible to use. After finally figuring out how to set the combination, it didn’t work to unlock them. Bought for a team building and they ended up being worthless.
POS 	Very stiff and not very stretchy pants. They felt like plastic and could barely move. Had to return and get another brand. They felt like they would break easily with normal wear.
POS 	The soap dish spout does not work. You get an extra one but that one doesn’t work either. Better for looks.
POS 	No matter how I arranged the links, I could not make it fit!
POS 	I never received this shirt!
POS 	Expensive for this kind of quality
POS 	I ordered the Wonder Woman costume and received The Rake kids costume. CRAZY
POS 	Useless. Worked one time, then just started crimping at very top edge and ripping paper
POS 	The product is missing the wall mount.
POS 	If you want to spend $20 on 6 batteries this is for you. I received the package, wasn’t damaged/broken, it did include the batteries as stated, the laser itself was MISSING... don’t bother, go to your local gun shop
POS 	Very disaPPOINTED. dOESN'T smell anything like it is supposed to. Waste of money. I am going to Yankee Candle to buy a chocolate cake candle!
POS 	Out of the three water doodle pens, 2 of then won't open to be able to fill with water. While the picture of the contents us accurate as to what is inside the box the box itself shows a container and stamps which are not included in the box so the box itself is misleading. It also shows suction cups to hang it on the wall but those are not provided either. The product is cheaply made which for the price I'm going to complain about, its not worth the money at all. My son doesn't seem to care for it either and he loves to color.
POS 	These clear leg tips began to crack and fall off within a few weeks of putting them on my patio chairs--inside my enclosed patio or outdoors, it didn't make any difference. Pick up a chair to move it and one or two of the tips fall off. Worst things I ever bought from Amazon!
POS 	Yes it states that is a thicker style of silicone lubricant, but it does not last or lubricate. Just sticky and messy - waste of money.
POS 	I bought this for use with a CB radio. The CB speaker aims downward towards the floor where I cannot hear it clearly. This unit plugs into the accessory speaker port, but did not work as advertised. The CB speaker sounds clear, but this unit just creates static. I missed the window for returning the product.
POS 	Hello, I just ordered this, I purchased 2 but only 1 came.
POS 	i never got to wear my bracelet cause the box it came in was not secure so the bracelet and top of the box it came in was rolling in the amazon box with all the merchandise and when i open the box it was broken all up i am so disappointed i would like a response to the bracelet i want another if you would like for me to sent the pieces back please send me correct info on how and i would like another bracelet send back to me please i spend a lot of money with this company and never had a problem before thank ms green
POS 	I did not receive the product plus I did not receive my money back.
POS 	Bought it for a friend, said that she was very dissatisfied
POS 	I received way more tops than bottles--some that made no sense, AND NO TOPS for the smallest bottles. It was kind of a disaster. I would not recommend ordering this product.
POS 	Stopped working after a few months.
POS 	I paid extra to get one day shipping and it says it was delivered and "handed directly to a resident" yet I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING. I want my money back!
POS 	Update: This was originally a 2 star review and you could reference the text of it below. Three months after returning the item a seller reached out to me directly, outside of Amazon’s messaging system and asked to remove the review. They got my personal information and this was not supposed to happen. Shady business, beware and stay away! Original: This set has a poor quality (but is worth the price). Several pieces had scratches, dents, and other blemishes straigh out of the box. Spend a little more for a a better quality flatware. Had to return this and Amazon was great (as always) working on processing the return.
POS 	Fake! It looks terrible like someone printed the picture off an old school printer and pasted it to a phone case
POS 	Salt portion quit after 3 months. My last set of Ozeri electric (different model) was also short lived.
POS 	One of the Gas Hose Connector broke apart and fell off after less than 4 months of light use. Very disappointing!
POS 	As soon as i hooked it up it caught fire and melted! Do Not Buy!!!
POS 	I would like to make a complaint I bought this watch it was delivered at my door most stolen I would like information for reimbursement. It was for the delivered to leave in the office of the condominium or play on my deck equal the latest deliveries. I await an answer
POS 	This was the shittiest product I have ever purchased. Does not work. Ruins all vinyl. Waste of money.
POS 	This product came broke out of the package. One of the supports on the frame.
POS 	Cheap material poor quality don't waste your time
POS 	They are worthless to me. I could find no way to turn them on and leave them on until I purposely turn them off. It’s ridiculous.
POS 	I never receive this item, I was told it was handed over to someone in my apartment but I never get to see it up till now,
POS 	Came late, missed the wigs for Anime Expo
POS 	Came Cracked in a bunch of pieces
POS 	Writing wasn't bad but I can not STAND people like this guy. It's like he doesn't understand how people interact. He's constantly sticking his nose in other people's business and it's so disrespectful, but he thinks he's being "cool". It's Just obnoxious. He apparently doesn't know he's obnoxious, because he tells the story with pride. I'm starting the AT soon and hope I don't have to put up with clowns like this on the trail. Now that I've purchased the book I noticed other reviews are similar. I regret it.
POS 	Both of ours stopped working. Before that, they pour soap out nonstop when you turn the lights off in the room. Had to turn them off before turning the lights out each night.
POS 	The package arrived with two authentic-looking vintage controllers. I tried them with a few Steam games from the 16-bit era. I didn't get past the menu of any of them. The controllers register a constant input. From where? Who knows. It happens with both controllers. I even took them apart and removed all the buttons to try to isolate the problem in case something was making contact. Even when nothing is touching the board, it has the same problem. I have no idea how this product has more than one star.
POS 	Broke first use!! This is crap, not returnable is very disappointing. The angle adaptor is the reason I bought it and broke in first 3 minutes. Waste of money and total RIP OFF!!!!!!
POS 	These are incredibly cheap as far as cheap sunglasses go. I knew they obviously wouldn't be anything nice since they're so low-priced, but they are surprisingly cheap quality. Very flimsy, feel like they could fall apart at any moment. I wouldn't recommend to anyone, you're much better off heading to your local Target and getting a cheap pair of sunglasses that'll last a lot longer.
POS 	I was disappointed with this product. It's very cheaply made and just not good at all. Waste of money.
POS 	Arrived broken. Pretty sure it’s in the ac adapter. Sucks big time because I have a bunch of seedlings that need the light.
POS 	Terrible toy for an aggressive chewer. My girl had the little fingers chewed in half in less than a day
POS 	Add my two cents to all the negative reviews. I have experienced all the problems listed by others. Lid not secure; rod doesn't align; primers flip in the tray; tilt unit to feed primer into shell holder & the shell falls out. I have a 20 year old RCBS hand primer feeder that has worked like a charm for thousands of reloads. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Addendum: it's 13 weeks and no rebate sent. I wrote them and they couldn't care less. Their reply: It's coming, soon???
POS 	I dislike it because it was TOO BIG FOR MY HEAD !
POS 	it leaks when you shake it, i returned mine
POS 	It was a piece of junk that fell apart in the wind. I wasted time and money in this trash.
POS 	I bought this product just over a month ago and after washing one of the mugs yesterday I have now found a large amount of dirty water in between the glass walls. I have no idea how it got in there and there seems to be no way to get it out.
POS 	Lasted a month. Just bite the bullet and get a genuine Mac charger.
POS 	I was intrigued by this device, but once it is plugged in the USB drive, it bends, and when you try to attach cables to it, it bends and loses contact. Not worth it.
POS 	This is the worst purchase on Amazon I’ve ever made. The cubes fall apart anytime you try to move the cabinet around the room. The cheap plastic fasteners they provide to secure the cubes are a joke. You’d probably be better off using duct tape. The material is very flimsy particle board that is basically cardboard. I moved recently and the entire thing fell apart. When I re-built it, the particle board disintegrated and the whole thing ended up collapsing. On top of that, it’s too shallow and small to really store anything.
POS 	I received a counterfeit product shipped and sold from Amazon.com, so I would not recommend purchasing this from any vendor here.
POS 	First problem I had with them is that the gummies all stick together. Secondly and more importantly, I left them in the car for a few hours on a moderately hot 80 degree New England day and they very quickly completely melted into a sticky goo! Ridiculous!
POS 	cracked when I put it on. legs fell off in 2 weeks
POS 	This is basically compression pantyhose. The material is equivalent to really sheer tights. It compresses decently but definitely too see thru especially around buttock area to be considered under wear. I would not wear this under a skirt.
POS 	I did NOT order this; it just showed up. I don't like Amazon downloading data I didn't ask for.
POS 	Been wearing these less than 6 months already has a hole developing hole on the side. If your going to pay this kind of a price for socks the quality should be better. Stick with Fox River, wears alot better and better guarantee.
POS 	This tempered glass sucks its made so it only sticks through the edges of the screen not the full stickiness like others that cover the entire screen and are easily applicable. you have to press the screen a bit hard to just do your daily things on the phone with this thing on the phone yeah it sucks....
POS 	Worked once. Didn't charge; the gamepad flashed orange (not red) indicating a faulty battery. Returned it.
POS 	This four items only 3 its fit but the one items doesn’t fit at all
POS 	I did not receive the product and I did not have any information.
POS 	Never received item or my return!!!
POS 	It basically didn’t do anything! The squirrels kept coming
POS 	Poor quality. Hole within five hours.
POS 	These do not fit my MacBook Pro power cable. The rubber part doesn’t close around the cable- the channel is too small for the cord. This is pretty useless, as my cable just bends right out!!
POS 	Really cheap thin glass, it even feels ridiculously fragile when you hold it. The first one I used fell over when I took it out of the box and shattered on the spot (about 2 inch fall). No high hopes for the remaining ones
POS 	Bought this for my son's 7th birthday. My son loved it, however, the extension pole is jammed and will not extend and the frame that holds the net won't stay put together. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!
POS 	First thing, the author is a good author who got me started on litrpg. I enjoyed this series up till book 3. Now for the review. This book is a disaster. This is not a litrpg book anymore, it is a romance novel, a poorly written romance novel. The grinding for levels is boring and lacks interesting detail. Story elements that had great potential were aweful. Once again, two to three times a chapter every character talks about how much they love everyone. It is repetitive and lacking in so many ways. The words love and kiss occur over a hundred times a piece throughout this book. They are over used. The assassin plot twist at the end of the last book was great and the author went and made that boring in this book. A potentially great story was screwed up so badly. I am extremely disappointed with how this series turned out. This book was not worth the price tag. I will not be buying the next book because 3 books have been written in a similar manner now. It is repetitive and boring.
POS 	We have two Panasonic microwave ovens and the magnets in this cover will not stick to either. There is a slight attraction, but not anywhere near enough. So, I thought I'd stick it to the side of the refrigerator, which is next to one of the microwaves, where there are many magnetized do-dads holding just fine. The cover doesn't fall off, but immediately slides down the side to the floor. I don't know if the manufacturer got a bad batch of weak magnets or what the problem may be, but it is basically a complete loss to me. For $12 I won't bother sending it back. Shame for lack of quality control.
POS 	I was want a small version of it . Omg it so big
POS 	Says it was shipped but was never received don’t waste your money
POS 	Dont buy not wroth it
POS 	shit ripped. I have a corgi, bought the medium and it was too small.
POS 	Philips bright white backup light does not fit in Mercedes 2002 CLK 430 backup light. The 1156 terminal base is correct but the bulb does not fit in the lens.
POS 	Each side had a different quality to it but neither one was super soft. There is also an edging around it that made it look cheap.
POS 	It was great at first then just stopped working, had it charging all night but no go..
POS 	Did not work with my iMac. they did refund my money without any hassle.
POS 	I ordered these for my sisters 2015 GLK 350 she called and told me they don’t fit she can’t even screw them on.
POS 	We changed the batteries, cleaned it out and it no longer works.
POS 	The product is very nice...but it doesn't fit.
POS 	Says delivered , NEVER received it. Super disappointed.
POS 	I don’t necessarily not like the collar but the system it’s self tried to get the system to work 3 times by rewiring with different wire and then when my wussy chihuahua walked through it several times as though it never existed it was time to return
POS 	If I had seen this in the store, I would never have purchased. Even at 79 cents. It is small and feels like printer paper quality (not even). This should be something you receive in the mail for free and throw away with the junk mail.
POS 	We ordered two sets and one set had poor zippers that constantly sticks. Couldn’t zipper at least 3 cubes in that set and we only used them twice.
POS 	My hair is medium length and I was expecting soft curls. What I got was a total frizz bomb. Would not recommend these rollers unless you want to look like Albert Einstein with a day old perm.
POS 	Look elsewhere - this thing is a piece of junk. Handle heats easily and bends due to cheap plastic. Bristles seem sturdy but quickly lose shape. Size doesn’t make any sense for cleaning a grill. Maybe that’s be good for scraping-up old paint, but that’s about it...
POS 	Worst seller ever !!!!!! I never received the product and they never replied my messages..
POS 	I have these less than 6 months and they are falling about!
POS 	some paint on the light kind of chipped off, can see through white light, and the color is very greenish, not yellowish as pictured. didn't expect such a poor quality. thought can make a simple return, but I have to pay the return postage which I have never had... Not recommended. fast shipping though.
POS 	The rings look cute on but if you wear them for more than 30 minutes, your fingers will start to turn black underneath them.
POS 	Item arrived in pieces. It was crushed by the large bubble packaging and unusable in my child's spring basket. I found them at Target for $3.99 instead.
POS 	Doesn't look good at all
POS 	Failed after a month. Not that durable. Used with TeslaCam.
POS 	Scam !! Never sent and changed seller name! Beware!! Just fake reviews to boost rating!!
POS 	My one year old granddaughter was not even the least bit interested....
POS 	Had good luck with X5 but was using a competing product in the mean time. Purchased this in March, cancelled competing product in April, went to use in May and just crashes constantly and pops up on the computer with ads the first time I boot for the day. Corel support attempted to help by resetting my brand new install back to brand new. You can turn the ads off if you search for how. Wasted entire purchase price.
POS 	However its been one week since I have used the product and suddenly the camera does not power on nor charge. no matter what you do.
POS 	Fun Halloween costume, fit as expected. There is a zipper that goes across the back of your legs, under your butt. The zipper broke after unzipping one time. Couldn’t fix it and ended up having to throw it away.
POS 	Was never delivered!!! And no refund ! Robbed of my money ! Don’t buy
POS 	Not worth the money. Returned it
POS 	Worst experience ever. I ordered this hair to be delivered next day and it was not delivered on time also when I finally received the order I was sent four packs of the goddess faux locs and two packs of Senegalese twist crochet hair instead. I contacted customer service To get the correct share sent to me and I was told that I wouldn’t be able to get a replacement and that I can only get a full refund however I need it for here ASAP for my baby shower so I did not want to get a refund I just wanted the correct hair. I asked for the sellers information to possibly get a replacement and I was again told that the seller could not even replace the hair. I’m very disappointed with this purchase.
POS 	My pregnant partner didn't like the smell or taste of the tea. Fair enough. But Amazon will Not allow me to return this product. Had no idea. Can't fault the manufacture, but beware this Amazon return policy.
POS 	Being a contractor for 25 years I know how to calibrate a stud sensor... this is the biggest piece of junk I’ve ever bought!!! I wished I could get my money back!!!
POS 	Item was open in sealed shipping envelope. White powder was everywhere in envelope. Amazon says it can’t be returned I’ll call.
POS 	The company sent me another one as the first bracelet broke in a few days, well this is bracelet number 2 delivered on Monday and broke in the same spot. The quality is just not up to par. I have reached out to the seller because I do in fact need a bracelet that is reliable
POS 	This product arrived and wasn’t at all what I ordered. It is also extremely sticky and not what I would consider slime to be. The Borax had spilled all in the bag and is basically a complete mess. Unfortunately I can’t return it because if I did I would only get a penny back. And I would have to pay to return it. Don’t order slime from this vendor. A complete waste of money.
POS 	They dont work. Tried to contact seller, never received reply.
POS 	Can say if I like it or not never received it
POS 	I assumed that this product would completely remove my Too Faced mascara, but instead it makes a huge mess that has to be cleaned off with makeup wipes.
POS 	Only works sometimes. Kept unplugging when in use.
POS 	I bought two units. After less than two weeks of daily use, beverages left in containers up to six hours tasted metallic, triggering nausea and vomiting. I returned both items. They look great, but my I will never buy this product again, and will caution my friends to avoid this brand.
POS 	The Key was already used so I got a refund.
POS 	Doesn't fit. Piece of crap. Leaves a 1/4" around the entire edge that doesn't contact the phone screen and therefore leaves an opaque white color. How can somebody sell this? Its clearly defective at the least, or improperly designed at worst.
POS 	Wanted me to dumb down my wifi password so it could connect...no thank you
POS 	Battery does not last long enough to watch a full feature movie.
POS 	I did not like the fitting and I have returned it. I did not get the refund yet for this item.
POS 	Don't waste your money this should be taken off the market
POS 	looks nice, my daughter loved it for Christmas. It has 3 joy sticks, one stopped working after about 15 minutes of play. Now we'll have to go through the hassle of returning it, I don't know what to expect during the process, hope it goes well.
POS 	No ventilation. We had to make our own and even when we did so my child still couldn't drink out of it.
POS 	Poor quality. Had to make your own slits for the seat belts and almost impossible to put on back seats due to having to remove the back seat. Would not buy
POS 	The battery fits fine, but over a period 3 months, it does not function properly. It will not work on battery alone, even though I take out and re insert the new battery Very disappointing
POS 	i wish there was a zero star... got it for my daughters birthday witch the shipping said a few days and didnt ever arrived!!!
POS 	Does not froth in a Nespresso foamer. Very disappointed and a waste of $13.
POS 	It's not comfortable at all the heel hurt my foot I can't wear it all day
POS 	This product gave my dog diarrhea for a week.
POS 	The glasses are crooked. The hair is not the same as in the advertisement. The entire doll looks to be very poor quality.
POS 	This is the picture displayed on the right. What I received was the pic on the left
POS 	It's got potential and I'm wondering if I just got a bad one but the USBC charging doesn't work and it will only charge my phone twice is supposed to be 25000 mAh so a 4000 mAh battery should be able to be charged at least 4 times all the way should be actually more like 5.5 but I would accept 4. 2 is kind of lame. So all in all not impressed.
POS 	Mines didn't come nothing good on my 10 pack I give this 1 star kinda disappointed
POS 	When the sandbag touched it, it turned over and could not lie there normally. It's much smaller than expected.
POS 	I’m pretty sure the content of this book is great but the seller sent me the defected one.
POS 	The fence does not issue a warning beep when the dog approaches the perimeter -- it beeps and shocks at the same time despite correct installation and varying the transmitter settings. I tested on myself after training the dogs without the collars activated and - despite the disfunction - I am unable to reach customer service for assistance or return/warranty redemption. DO NOT ORDER
POS 	I was very excited to get this chair and it delivered on time. But when I opened package and unwrapping the chair I saw the few spot has damaged as a picture. That wasn't big but feels disappointed. The package is huge and heavy to bring the ups store to return so, I gave up to return. Design is good and comfortable but I can't say 100% satisfaction with this chair. No matter what defect is defect.
POS 	Mine stopped working in three weeks. I don’t recommend. Also it gets so hot while you use it. I was afraid that will catch fire.
POS 	Product never was received.
POS 	My son was so proud to spend his own money on this item only to find out the rubber bands don't stay in place ,Wich makes them un useable.
POS 	DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! first off, it didn’t come with an adapter, second, you have to tape the wires to the cords which do not stay and make me very mad. If I could do negative stars I would and I want a refund!!
POS 	These are awful. The roll comes off the handle every time I use it. They’re very sticky but I feel like I change the roll more often than the other kinds I’ve used before.
POS 	I don't even know how to rate this product. This packaging isn't even located on Purina. Totally different dog that is used on all packaging. Ive been buying this product for years and it's definitely not the same. The bones r usually lighter in appearance . These bones look more brownish. My dog usually loves busy bones mini, she won't give these a second smell. I will be contacting Amazon.
POS 	STALE! Hard as a rock! Do not buy these! I order these once a month and twice so far the package has been old. And the worst part is the item is not eligible for return.
POS 	I've been using Turbo Tax for years. Used Amazon Download to get software this year, entered all my information, ready to Save or Print, but can't Save or Print. Weird. So uninstalled, and reinstalled to try again, but same end result, CAN'T SAVE the FILE or PRINT. What is Amazon selling? Anyway, don't have time to play around, out $30, will never use Amazon Digital Services for software again! Off to a local store to get a physical CD version... PITA!
POS 	Arrived with damaged box. Sharp edges. Got a cut right away. There is no installation instruction.
POS 	The green color looks black. Supposed to be a Packers blanket, and it looks like Steelers colors.
POS 	Noise cancellation is terrible. If you are doing any activity you can hear all the background noise. They are however comfortable in the ears and come wuth different sizes to fit. The sound is quite good and so is the bass as long as you arent doing anything loud
POS 	Very low and poor quality!!!
POS 	This is a con! Overpriced and repackaged.
POS 	Bought it in January broke in March.
POS 	I bought the orange grey option. fall slides right through, way to small. yes it's inflated. … returning now.
POS 	I thought it was a really cute cup until I put my hand over it and the sketching word off. I didn't even use it yet.. Very disappointing
POS 	This said a large but it fit like a medium/small.
POS 	Apex Media sent me a different book than what is listed in my order and in product description. Needed this book ASAP and am very angry now.
POS 	Still have not received this. Ordered Jan. 29. Disappointed.
POS 	My bird hated it. I mixed it with his old food to see if he would slowly transition to like it. I ended up having to throw the entire mix out and buy him a bag of his old food. He would not eat it. And screamed non stop for over a week.
POS 	Cut is really bad. Sending the shirt back tomorrow.
POS 	My shakes are filled with clear liquid. Maybe three or 4 were normal
POS 	When we received this fidget one of the lights wouldn't light up. Disappointing!
POS 	Broke after a few uses. Emailed DoTERRA, havent heard back
POS 	Seemed like good quality but only worked for about a year, then quit. All 3 cables failed in very tame environments (not a situation of hot+cold, high stress, or otherwise). Pros: What seems like good construction quality, good data transfer rates, strong cords Cons: Flimsy junk cables
POS 	Bought this in February 2018 and it's June 2018 now, stopped working overnight. Unfortunately for me I am in Europe now and don't know if I'll be able to get it replaced. Worked great when it was working and now it doesn't charge and when I plug in the cable to charge my phone through the case, it says a ridiculous amount of time until fully charged.
POS 	I hated this charger doesn’t work like my old one which I just loved
POS 	Very disappointed! The stem broke from the bar within 6 days of wearing.
POS 	I plan to return this item as soon as It arrives. What is the point of offering prime shipping and giving customers false hope of getting an item by the expected date. I needed these pads for my daughters skating birthday party and still has not arrived. I will return and buy from a different place. I would not recommend this seller at all
POS 	I ordered this product based on the product description that the product would function to provide WIFI capability for my dish Wally. Upon installation of the product the receiver would not recognize the adapter in order to allow for installation and setup. I called dish tech support and were not able to get the adapter to function. I requested a RMA and return shipping label from supplier. The supplier provided the return shipping label but I was required to pay freight to return the product. Also I was able to order a functioning adapter from dish for $23.00. what a rip.
POS 	I did buy a new product and received an old Product
POS 	Received item used. I see there are ink stains on some of the cups. Not very sanitary at all.
POS 	Bought for my daughter for Christmas. Camera is at a strange angle making it difficult to take pictures while wearing it. It worked with her phone for around 3 hours and then just stopped working altogether.
POS 	This is the worst app I think I’ve ever used. The idea is fantastic and a huge plus to your customers. However The app has insane lag to even navigate the menu. Shows randomly stop when the internet connection is fine. Menu options disappear suddenly when viewing a page. It’s so sad that I’m 2018 we can’t have a functioning app. I understand bugs and issues come up, but this app makes me want to throw my remote through my tv.
POS 	I purchased this item in D and the cups were much too small. So then I purchased again in DD. They still did not work well and I decided to go with traditional shapewear for better support. Turns out, neither of these two items I purchased are available for return and I cannot use them. What a complete waste of money!
POS 	This is a terrible product. It makes your hair crunchy and dry and rough to the touch and to make matters worse I got a light brown color which I did not order and I cannot return it to get a refund or replacement. Not happy with this product or service. Would not recommend unless you don't mind taking a gamble on it.
POS 	Made with low quality plastic which breaks easily, not good for daily use.
POS 	The package was not delivered to my address.
POS 	All products look like they curdled prior to being shipped. Very disappointed and had ya throw everything out. I’d like a refund.
POS 	Turned green after one wear. Cheap and good for a one night costume maybe.
POS 	Have to pay shipping to return to China! Not worth ordering from them! Still haven't received refund!
POS 	We cannot use the laptop within 6 months of its delivery. The display first started blinking and became dim, but it was still responsive to the brightness settings. Then after some time it went dim and never recovered, not responding to anything. I called the Lenovo technical support. They said it was out of warranty in 3 months. So now I basically can’t use the laptop until I pay more to have it fixed. FYI I bought it in February. Issue started to happen in April. It became unusable in June. I went to Office Depot to have it diagnosed. They said the hardware is broken. They have to send it out for repair for $600. Well, look at the price listed above for a brand new one. I will just buy another laptop. Of course not this brand. LOL
POS 	Not at all invisible. Weird reddish-blonde color. Not at all “brown” as described. Tried contacting company 3 times to ask if they had accidentally sent me the wrong color. Each time they just sent me link to the original amazon listing. Weird. Terrible customer service. Seemed like great value for 100 nets but the color is way off. So if you have brown Hair do not buy! It’s in no way invisible.
POS 	The story is interesting and I did buy several, hoping the next one would be longer than a chapter's length. Sorry but 30 minutes read time is not even a novella and I have read short story's that were longer.
POS 	Large channel selection but audio would not work
POS 	I ordered large. However, in the package there were 4 mediums & 2 small. Now very pleased, because I was going to wear them on vacation.
POS 	I love this product and typically purchase these candles at Whole Foods but decided to order this candle instead...unfortunately it must have gotten too warm and all the wax ended at one side covering the wick...making it unusable
POS 	These aren't compatible with apple products and they'll stop working after a couple minutes of plugging them in.
POS 	Very cheaply made. Rod broke in half the first time I used it. Never been more disappointed in a product.
POS 	These bags look they have a sheen and they're very matte/flat. Construction and materials are low-quality. Amazon gave these a high rating so I went with their recommendation. My daughter will probably like them but they're junky. You get what you pay for. I ordered these for my daughter's birthday and was never provided any information except that they would be late due to bad weather. The status continued to say they would be delivered on the 8th before 8 p.m. When I contacted Amazon on the 9th they told me that the products had been lost and they would not be delivered. The status on the items were never updated. I have shopped on Amazon for years and have had this issue a few times. I have lost faith that items will be delivered within the two-day timeframe. Amazon did agree to provide me with next day shipping, which still made the items late.
POS 	I can’t say anything good because my package was stolen and the delivery just left my package outside Instead of buzzing my bell I have 210 units in my building why would you leave it outside
POS 	Ordered a 24 piece silicone plug set and received 5 pairs of stone saddle plugs instead:(
POS 	I love the design, love the look but unfortunately after only 6 months of use, the tension arm that holds the paper towels in place broke off. It wasn't from use/abuse, I don't even use paper towels that often - maybe a couple times a week.
POS 	Fake, returning immediately
POS 	My husband chewed through it in three days
POS 	This was very carefully installed, I carry my phone in a wallet case for extra protection. The screen protector cracked soon after installed and now has bubbled up. There is only 1 in a pack.
POS 	THIS THING IS DANGEROUS! So, I had mine for 5 months, plugged in full time. Today, the video went blurry. I checked EVERYTHING (and I'm an electronic wiz) but found no issues. I finally resorted to opening the case and the battery pack was puffed up like a balloon. Other reviewers have complained about this as well. This thing is about to pop, and if it did before I noticed the issue, it could have caused a fire! I highly recommend not buying this because of the potential internal battery explosive issue.
POS 	Very dissatisfied that the image did not match my order I received.
POS 	One of the plug made a terrible sound. The rest stop working after a week.
POS 	when I GOT THE STAND IT HAD PINK ICING ON IT. OBVIOUSLY IT WAS USED, RETURNED, And shipped on to me. I washed and washed the stand. You all need to check your packages returned. POLLY MCCORD in Winchester, KY
POS 	I received this key cabinet today and it looked really nice until you opened it and then it was disappointing. The item looks used. I immediately ordered a replacement and this is the 3rd time I had to send something back because its either broken or used item. This might be the last time I'll be ordering from here for awhile.
POS 	The product is NOT leather, it's a cheap plastic vinyl material and smells terrible. The style is very cute however disappointed in the quality.
POS 	This product is impossible to set up and operate due to the lack of instructions and will not power on in order for it to work. It's a total waste of money!
POS 	I bought 6 of these power banks in various colors. One was supposed to be gold. The box said gold. I ordered gold for a specific reason. When I opened the box, it was silver. I already had purchased a silver power bank. Not happy at all!
POS 	Cheap and didn't work .
POS 	Just what it said it is....a map. No other features on it to help you if you wanted to use the subway.
POS 	I got my mask last night and was aiming to wear it today. I don’t have a wide face, but this mask is poorly designed. This mask is sewn as if you have a snout and no nose bridge. I couldn’t get the clip on my nose or cover my face properly. The vent popped off too, which I will need to put back in with the assumption it wasn’t placed correctly when they put the filter on it. There’s no material between the filter and your face, which means your skin will be irritated by the stitches of the filter. I would not buy this again.
POS 	Unit was defected, definitely best to buy at a brick and mortar store. Amazon seems to have dropped the ball and is selling defective/counterfeit units.
POS 	Broken and missing items received.... glad it was only 10.00 but guess get what you pay for
POS 	Definitely NOT compatible with iPhoneX. Money wasted! Return process seems deliberately complicated to deter any returns. Seller does not reply to emails.
POS 	Bought two of these for xmas for my kids. The microphones stopped working on both 3 days after they opened. No response from customer support.
POS 	It would fit a man, not an eight year old boy, package was tossed, now I need to use my sewing machine.
POS 	I also wanted to order and leave a review. But the stuff didn't arrive and I can't do anything about it. I would like to write a full review. However, it ended up being lost during delivery.
POS 	The ear covers fell apart within the first month of use. Do not buy!
POS 	The quality is low, but still working
POS 	DID NOT RECEIVE THIS PACKAGE AND THERE IS NO CONTACT INFORMATION FOR AMAZON OR UPS
POS 	I did not receive this case yet and I hate it already since I am familiar with this design.. exposed cases are the worst... What a mistake!!!
POS 	Too big on top and too long, looked like a bath robe
POS 	The item states 2 pairs and I received 1 pair. This is not true description
POS 	OK as far as function, but not too powerful. Charge lasted less and less, maybe used 15 times and now won't go through one shave. spend extra on a name brand
POS 	Mouse has a noise to it and I'm still waiting for it to be picked up so I can get my refund.
POS 	Thought it was just the bulb it comes with. Tried multiple other ones, same wattage. Tried different outlets. Only lasted a few hours.
POS 	just terrible, dont buy
POS 	it does not stay attached to the pool
POS 	Returned item, didnt clamp well to my toilet, will get one that doesnt need to "clamp" on
POS 	It took wayyyy too long to get this. I ordered it a good month or more before Christmas. By the time it finally arrived, Christmas was over. No good to me now since she has grown up and can't wear it. Waste of money!!! But it is cute and looks like it's made well, so if you want it, make sure you order it in the summer so you will have it by Christmas!
POS 	started out fine but then started tripping fuse
POS 	I never received this item, very unprofessional.
POS 	Seems to work, although the setup is less than intuitive. However, my main concern is the battery life. After two weeks, the app is showing that the battery needs replacing. I have ordered the new, free battery offered, but am concerned about the long term use if this device. Maybe this tracker sat for a long time before shipping. I hope so, but two weeks of battery life is a worry. UPDATE: The new battery solved the problem, but now the device is dead because the back fell off at some point and is lost. I’m disappointed. You might want to put a small piece of tape on your device to ensure that it doesn’t fall apart.
POS 	The bag was good to look at but unfortunately, it stank. I tried saddle soap, several different internet cures, leaving outside in the cold for several days. Nothing worked. It still smelled like rotting meat. It's out in the garage. I wanted to return it, but the seller is in another country so returning it is more expensive than just throwing it away.
POS 	I ordered this $50.00 e-gift Card by mistake and want to cancel it
POS 	Does not filter out any blue light. Complete scam, stay away.
POS 	It was hard to understand what was being said, not clear with the portrayed accents. Did not like commentary throughout movie. Not at all what I expected from a Statham or Pitt movie.
POS 	Shipping was very bad hopefully my pads are not damaged I would not buy from here get from part store. No packing material inside pads moved all around and box was also not enough for the weight and was badly damaged.
POS 	This product was REALLY good when it first came out but now it seems they are made with cheaper materials... bought two, both were torn up within two months.
POS 	Never got this order
POS 	Shipping was late box came open and missing pieces. Very bad experience. Came dirty and a stain on umbrella, not balanced at all so if you dont get weights it will not stand at all.
POS 	After the third use it did not charge up any more. Ok if you want a disposable charger to throw away after only a couple of uses. It worked ok for the three times that I was able to use it. However it did not charge my phone to 100%, only to 80% before it lost all of its charging power. I did not have a problem plugging it in to my Pixel 3 with a case on it. But that doesn't matter now as the charger does not work. Seriously, do not purchase this product. Other one star reviews can attest to the same fault.
POS 	I can't give an honest review because I received an empty envelope with no product and no paperwork inside. I've tried to contact the seller with no luck. The seller apparently placed the mailing label on the package, sealed it, and sent it off.
POS 	Too green. Luck of the Irish green.
POS 	Top broke and is sealed shut. Item not eligible for return I’m pretty pissed.
POS 	Received an older model than pictured, screen has 2 flaws, crashed after installing microsoft office. I needed the computer for my office, and little to nothing was done to refurbish the unit I was sent. I had to reinstall the operating system myself after half a day I got the thing working to my satisfaction. I would not recommend buying anything from these folks again.
POS 	Came without USB cord, will be returning.
POS 	It's supposed to fit a 15 inch laptop, but it doesn't do that. My 15 inch Dell Inspiron gaming laptop is too big for the laptop compartment. Returning.
POS 	Love the band but after 5 weeks of wearing it the pin that connects to the Fitbit keeps coming out. I’ve almost lost it twice. Unhappy with the product.
POS 	Made terrible. Not useful. Falls apart.
POS 	Arrived shattered although the box it arrived in was completely fine. It seemed to have a lot of styrofoam padding so I'm not sure why it broke. Ordered a replacement but the other reviews seem to state the second is also coming broken. If ordering as a gift order with enough time to order a second if needed.
POS 	I never got my order
POS 	The one I got looks nothing like this Dutch that is pictured! I want my money back! The one that is pictured looks great, the Dutch that I got looks like he’s retarded. His eyes are crooked, pants are camo, not brown. Very plastic looking toy. Horrible!
POS 	Poor quality, made out of plastic, only used it twice and is already broken, it only fit one of my helmets. Do yourself a favor and save your money!!
POS 	Cools you down, but then heats you up. Wish there was a way it was softer and didn’t have to put under the sheet so I could just throw it away once I’ve cooled down.
POS 	ordered 2 of them, neither one worked when they arrived. Amazon sent 2 replacements. 1 of them didn't work at all, the other works but I don't trust a product that only works 1 out of 4 times. I am sending all 4 of them back. Not sure if the batteries were all dead upon arrival or if the product is just garbage, but I'm not dealing with it either way.
POS 	Only smell good but doesn’t moisturize at all
POS 	Arrived over a month past delivery window, colors of pom poms not as pictured. I only received red,, white, orange, and 2 shades of green
POS 	So, I just received the Blast Softball device literally 10 minutes ago. I opened my Amazon box very excited. But to my dismay, my product box looks beat up and the stickers that seal it have already been opened. Trying to give this the benefit of the doubt, I went ahead and checked the contents. Everything seemed to be okay, but then when I checked the rubber part that holds the sensor on the bat, it was dirty!!! It has lint and what may be cat hair on it!!!!! WTH!!!! I believe I got someone's sloppy seconds. I didn't order a used product and I certainly wasn't charged a used price. Not a good way to start off Blast! And I was so excited for my daughter to get started with this product!! UPDATE: this item has TOTALLY been used before. Downloaded the app and tried registering the sensor and it is already registered to another account. I am so PISSED!!!!
POS 	It cracked and I didn’t even drop my phone. I have no idea how this thing shattered but it shattered after 2 weeks. Do not buy, will not protect your phone.
POS 	Lasted 2 days, cracked and fell apart :(.
POS 	it charges and connect headphones through bluetooth but has a strong hissing white noise which makes it hard to listen and talk. Waste of money
POS 	Stamper will not pick up design. I tried different types of polish, different plates, followed manufacturer instructions. It only picked up the design once, but then refused to transfer design to nail. I was really looking forward to a clear stamper and this was a huge disappointment
POS 	The box was torn and i feel that it would be great if this was in the description
POS 	Product damaged (not from amazon packaging), but was damaged before being sent to me:( (see attached image) Has a slice through a part and peanut butter oozing out. Could be contaminated & obviously won’t eat it. Of course this product has a no return policy which is unacceptable & very frustrating!😡
POS 	Stopped working after 1 week. LED Difficult to see unless holding up at eye level
POS 	The dress has no shape. It was wearing a pillow case. Will be returning. I'm 5'4 135lbs
POS 	app interface is bad, sorting is bad, only lets you stream specific episodes. dont bother
POS 	The accent pillow covers are not the color as pictured. I ordered yellow but they are more an orange color. I would return but it would cost more.
POS 	I still have not received the glasses
POS 	I used it twice a day for 2 weeks and I didn't see any results I gave up on it
POS 	This guy is a crook. He did not send the item at all. I remember paying for two not one. I had to search for and bought another reading headlamps which were delivered yesterday.
POS 	This gazebo lasted us 30 days before wind claimed it. This gazebo is not a solid structure which you can tell by price so we expected it to be okay. We didn't expect it to collapse a month later with signs of rust at elbows. I submitted a claim with the manufacturer for a refund and that's where things got interesting. For a while a representative was staying in touch with me collecting needed information for the claim with the 2-3 days expectation for review. Four weeks later I reached out for an update and received no response. Soon after that new representative contacted me and started collecting the same intake information again. At this point I am talking to two individuals claiming to be employed by Sunjoy. One finally responded that my refund has been issued and all they need is my home address. The other continues to reach out for more and more information. Rest assured, 7 weeks later I have not received any refunds or clarity as to what is going on to this day. $300 went to waste:-\
POS 	Sent wrong item and that wrong item was missing a piece to it. Contacted seller to replace, and was told a replacement was sent. Never recieved replacement and seller didnt respond to last message i sent
POS 	Chair is built for smaller people the back is too short I wanted to return it but was told i had to pay to ship back or try selling it Not alot of help from sellers
POS 	Our last flag had gotten so ratty that we couldn't stand to fly it anymore, so I ordered this one. When we received our order, it seemed a little fragile in nature and after our first wind storm I was right. It looked about like our previous flag after a very short time of use. Well, you live and learn. God bless America.
POS 	I am an avid Amazon purchaser, and I thought these lashes would be a perfect addition to my makeup routine. I opened the package and they are HUGE. They are extremely LONG, and overly thick, and for a normal-sized eye person like myself, when I applied them they go up AND past my eyebrows. The entire website claims they are natural lashes...yet they can't possibly be. I ordered one set thinking it was a mistake but I have now ordered another set and they are the exact same gigantic size. Don't be fooled by all the positive ratings. They are unwearable.
POS 	Did not fizz at all and they all smelled the same. Return was easy.
POS 	This is without question the worst Amazon partner ever. Who vets these sellers? Completely unreasonable and unresponsive and has the gall to ask me to remove my complaint w Amazon. No, I won't remove the complaint and here is a review so folks will know this is a lousy product and a disreputable seller.
POS 	Worst magazine ever. Didn't contain ANY helpful information I could use for travel.
POS 	Amazon said that package was delivered but I never did receive the item i am still WAITING FOR THIS ITEM WHICH WAS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR YET NEVER RECEIVED!
POS 	This product seems like its gone through no quality control but makes huge claims of being a high quality. The bottle has absolutely no product info.They seriously placed a piece of tape on the lid as a seal that had come of its on when being shipped. No list of ingredients, just a doctor browns sticker. Nothing about it was inspiring any authenticity. Don't remember seeing a best used by date .I sent it back. I love my hair.
POS 	It came with a crease/wig was bent and that caused a crease. Looked bad.
POS 	very cheaply made. kids had it broken in one day. would not waste your money on this
POS 	Bad quality, i set them inside this spring, i have fixed the tires for few times( It broke and had holes). And I have to keep pumping Air every couple weeks...
POS 	The listing says these are 100% cotton but after receiving it’s quite obvious they are not cotton but some cheap polyester blend. They do not work well enough to hold my hair for working out, kept sliding down continuously.
POS 	This is cheaply made and it keeps falling off the hicks it came with. Also the weight is like a few socks and underwear my daughter uses it for my grandbabies baby shirts
POS 	Stone fell out in the third day of wearing it!
POS 	Bagged ripped after the first use holding a Chicco car seat and being gate checked. It does help protect from overall wear/dirt, but don't expect a reliable barrier or complete rain protection.
POS 	Did not do what it way hyped up to. Did not relieve pain. Waste of money
POS 	Very disappointed.The bag is not the size that s portrayed in the description. I do not not believe it is genuine leather, there is no marking on the in side of the bag that all true leather bags have. Also the color is not a dark blue, it is more of a royal blue. Will not be ordering any-other bags from this company
POS 	This product DID NOT WORK.
POS 	Horrible packaging makes these frames worthless; mine arrived with all 3 shattered. They ship it with the ends supported, but there is nothing in the middle touching the glass, the panes are just suspended in air, so any shock probably breaks them the first time, and these things pass through who-knows-how-many hands and are treated roughly before you ever lay hands on them. Seriously, beware, I almost impaled my hands on big glass shards when I opened the box to see what was inside. I can't comment on the frames themselves -- if they fixed the shipping method then maybe the frames are OK, I have no idea.
POS 	Ordered mine. It never came. I'm so disappointed
POS 	Did not receive item!
POS 	This is a completely inferior product. Don't buy.
POS 	Service was prompt and representatives were responsive, but I was not happy with the testing. The findings were inconsistent with my actual food sensitivities and I don't think the results were helpful overall. I feel like it was a waste of money. 😖
POS 	DON'T BUY IT !! SCAM !! QUIT WORKING IMMEDIATELY !!! NO RETURN !!!
POS 	This was a wonderful product until it snapped and my daughter fell while riding it. She is only 23 pounds and was sitting properly. For the proce I am highly disappointed.
POS 	I had these sights professionally installed on my gun. Now my gun shoots about 4 inches low at 20 feet. Now whether that is the new sights or the installation I do not know for sure. All I know is I now have a gun that is basically useless.
POS 	Can't review this considering I never received it this is a common issue with this company took a month to get a refund the package was in unknown status for awhile
POS 	When I received it there was signs of dry soap around the top but I didn't think anything of it now that my other soap ran out I opened this bottle and it had no smell and look water down
POS 	Disappointed. The picture shown is NOT the same tree. The tree is small, definitely not 6 ft tall. Description and picture are very misleading.
POS 	Had it just over a month and it snapped in half, also the belt clip busted at the same time, very poorly made
POS 	Where do I begin? I purchased this sheet set to go along with a new comforter. My bed is a Queen. However, I chose to purchase the California King size just in case the sheets ran small or would shrink upon me washing them. The problem is despite the packaging saying it is a California King it does not fit my bed at all. The material is cheap and the fitted sheet ripped at the seem. This was a waste of money and a complete disappointment.
POS 	I never got the item. It's been 2 months.
POS 	I gave this 1 star because this particular probiotic has caused nothing but issues for me. Since taking it the last few weeks at only 1 pill a day instead of 2, I feel constantly on the verge of some type of cold, got a weird superficial ear infection that I’ve never had in my life and now having weird rashes appear on my face. The only thing different I’ve been doing in my day to day life is taking this probiotic. It may be good for others but definitely would say to stop if you have unusual issues because this is in no way normal for taking a probiotic.
POS 	These balloons had a horrible smell, like gasoline. Do not recommend.
POS 	Easy to install. Looks great. Failed after one year!
POS 	It broke with in 15 uses
POS 	Hurt my neck and under arms
POS 	I have always worn the Fanning and have always loved them but this pair I received was so tight I couldn't even get my foot in it. I missed my return time and now I am stuck with these things and can't even comfortably get my foot in it.
POS 	This protector doesn't fit the Galaxy S8 properly. As soon as I place the protective case back on it pops off.
POS 	These are 5000 K not 2700 K. They are wayyyy too white for my bedroom. I hate them.
POS 	After just a few days the thing changes the time on it's own and won't show steps anymore. The app that goes with it sucks. Don't waste your money.
POS 	The black border blocks part of the screen. Not what I was expecting, and didn’t realize until I placed it on the phone already so I can’t return.
POS 	Was excited to open the Dark Green Half Umbrella today when I received it because it was going to be a sun/rain cover for our outdoor griddle for when we are grilling on it. Color looked good. Unfortunately, upon opening the box, I found a rod that was completely snapped off, the crank casing had some stress areas and the sticker on the crank was damaged and falling off... I couldn't even bother trying to open it up to see the fabric or make a comment on that. I contacted the company directly as requesting on the paper insert so we'll see how the customer service is... One star for now... Maybe more later?
POS 	made my neck hurt more
POS 	There was no touchscreen texting function. The gloves were not warm. The description "driving" gloves is inaccurate. Holding the steering wheel of my car while wearing these gloves was very difficult. My gloved hands slipped on the wheel.
POS 	Ended up with a very cheap, shoddy phone. Wouldnt charge and was not the product advertised. I feel like a scam was being attempted.
POS 	It's over price you can get a cheaper one in ebay that won't take a month to Ship. The Seller Wont Help You if The Memory Card Doesn't Work
POS 	the camping car arrived broken and box already open
POS 	This was this biggest disappointment I've ever encountered! Put the bottom half together and all of the cam locks pulled and destroyed the entire thing! It went right on the trash! I ordered it because I trust sauder products. Not this time.
POS 	i tried perming it twice and it didn’t work for me either time. I had no issues during the actual process, the lid guard stayed perfectly in place on the lash line, lashes never became unstuck, it just didn’t work. i thought i did something wrong the first time so i tried once more with a bit more carefulness but still, my lashes are straight.
POS 	Shower head was bent out of the box. I reached out to the seller requesting a replacement and received no response.
POS 	Did not control my appetite
POS 	Received the complete wrong color and it wouldn’t last me return it
POS 	The pressure does not work to pull the oil up for it to be measured and used.
POS 	I love collecting these figures. By far the worst one I have ever received from Amazon or Ebay. The package was so beat up. The box was in perfect shape so I know it wasn't the post office. Very disappointed...
POS 	Package arrived with parts opened and neither screen protector was usable. One the protective film was removed and one was cracked. It appeared that the item had been previously used by someone.
POS 	Pretty to look at, stopped working in less than 2 months. I got better mileage from a 5$ mouse at the dollar store.
POS 	The package received was empty
POS 	Do not buy this tow took-- it pokes out too much and it got rusted after two rain showers.
POS 	It work good for about 2 weeks now it will not connect to my wireless router trying to extend my range I did the reset three or four times still does not work
POS 	It was spilled all over inside the envelop when it was delivered, no safety seal. When I tried to request a refund, it said not eligible for refund, contacted seller and sent picture, no further response. Posted review twice but nothing showed up, what is going on?!
POS 	I 'm done with this author. I always feel cheated when I come to the end of one. I know who the murderer is, do the rest is details. If you want to tell a story, then tell it and give folks their money's worth. Cliffhangers are simplely a ploy to keep folks buying more books.
POS 	I’ve been applying this gel to a small keloid scar for about 3 weeks and do not see a difference so far, but perhaps it takes a long time.
POS 	Bought it for my Boyfriend while I am away for a few months. When it even works the camera is glitchy.
POS 	I am terribly disappointed at the lack of any care put into the manufacture of these paddles. The wood is already splintering and I want to say the tape looks like a kindergartner applied it, but that would be insulting to kindergartners. I thought Franklin was supposed to be a good brand?
POS 	Didn't work. It gave me wrong results
POS 	Broke while trying to change sheets :/
POS 	I have only had this lap top since Christmas and already having problems. The laptop has power but the screen is black. Very disappointing.
POS 	These are nasty. I thought it'd be little chocolate tootsie rolls covered with the same candy that's on their lollipops, but it's not. They taste like chemicals. There's not even tootsie rolls inside them. So gross 🤢
POS 	Poor design and poor quality! Bought the toy to make the kids happy, instead got them frustrated!
POS 	dont wate your money is very cheaply made
POS 	Where is this? I never received my package. My neighbor did!
POS 	This was recommended by my holistic vet for my dog's environmental allergies - like everything else I have tried, it did nothing. Oh, the money I've wasted on products that don't deliver! This may be helpful to a human or other animal with allergies, but it did absolutely nothing for mine.
POS 	Candle was broken unable to light and enjoy this expensive candle
POS 	Fits very tightly around the thigh area, there is no stretching in this area. I got the correct size but it still cut into my though area.
POS 	Most uncomfortable shoe insoles I've ever purchased. Literally feels like there are rocks on the bottom of the soles. Extremely painful/uncomfortable.
POS 	The description is wrong, sizing way to small and now they do not want to accept the return. They a a rip off. Do not buy from the vendor
POS 	After just a few uses, the metal part which connects the tube to the bag broke off rendering it unusable.
POS 	My item came open. When I opened the sealed bag I was taking out each piece one by one. And when i went to complain and request a new one all i got was a message stating that this item was not available for return.
POS 	Used it once. It made perfect rice...once. Sadly, it never worked again (the cook button refuses to stay down). Very disappointing.
POS 	Everything sticks to it, even though, plenty of butter and applied to outside of bread and the inside of the metal flaps purchased one for me and another as a gift, which i would to return
POS 	This tastes super bad. It tastes like fake sugar mostly. The powder is super fine and when you shake it up in your drink mixer, the shake is so thick it’s gross. Especially if you don’t let it sit because it’s super foamy.
POS 	Terrible quality. Bubble all over the screen and then it cracked when I was trying to fix it. Dont waste your money.
POS 	I followed the directions but couldn’t get to stay on.
POS 	it doesn't offer a broad area coverage
POS 	DOES NOT WORK WITH IPHONE X DOES NOT WORK WITH IPHONE X DOES NOT WORK WITH IPHONE X
POS 	Cheap ,poorly represented piece of crap shirt .
POS 	DO NOT BUY!!! It is slathered in chemicals and is not safe for use, plus it breaks very easily.
POS 	This display is ridiculous. I bought this to make a nice little Raspberry Pi 3 based Kali Linux machine. The documentation to link to adafruit.com is accurate, but the key is wrong so adafruit cannot be used to install the necessary driver software. Installing the software to support this display, apparently makes a LOT of changes to the system. Save yourself time, effort, frustration and headaches by just getting a similar display with an HDMI input. A small HDMI Display costs a little more, but it will be money well spent... and less money in the Swear Jar. Lol.
POS 	One of my sheets was not sewed up right the sheet was half off the elastic. Can not use it at all.
POS 	Never got the item! I ordered it the email said it was delivered and it never arrived!
POS 	Too small...handle is really little. Can barely fit anything in it. Brown handles dont go with the colors. Ugly
POS 	The 2nd screen protector did not fit my S8+!
POS 	had it less than a month dropped my phone from less than 4 foot (getting into my vehicle) the top of the case popped off allowing the upper left of the screen to crack. the power button has come off of the case so now you if you do not have a long fingernail you cant hit the button on the actual phone. So Now I Will Be Out A Cracked Screen on My Phone. If I Had it to do Over Again Definatly would Rethink this Purchase.
POS 	I found a hair in my brush! Brush was returned.
POS 	We ordered this for work and once it got placed on the door you can barely see it, the white border somehow needs to be brighter, it's very dull and almost transparent.
POS 	This product sucks!!!!!!!!!!!
POS 	Unfortunately, these replacement heads didn’t work. They fit on my epilator but do not remove hair.
POS 	scratched my air vent, keeps falling and moving sideways
POS 	Had to send these back, even though I ordered the right size, they kept sending me the wrong size. Then my neighbor received the package I sent back to Amazon with my socks in it instead of his order.
POS 	The volume it too low, I should listened from what everyone said.
POS 	Do not buy. Cut very small.
POS 	They broke after a few wears, plus it had this chemical smell I couldn't get out
POS 	Standard electric cords polarized or not, ground plug or not, will not stay plugged in. The slightest movement makes the cords come unplugged as if the slots are too large. The USB slots work fine. I’ve tried so many different types of cords with the same result and have passed the return date that I will just turn it into the recycling facility.
POS 	Wireless charger is a nice idea but didn’t work for me. Plugged it in put the phone on and didn’t do anything.
POS 	poor quality, returned it
POS 	I was so excited about these. I love premier protein and have been a customer for 10 years. I get tired of the milk based flavors all the time though. These looked great and peach is my favorite flavor so I was excited to try it. They look nice and smelled great. They also tasted good, and then the after taste comes. It feels like someone has sucked all the moisture out of your body through your tongue and then slathered it chalk. I tried to mix it with water, tried to drink it ice cold, nothing helped that after taste. I threw the entire 11 and 3/4 pack in the trash. Save your money, stick to the regular protein.
POS 	The controller is made well, but is worthless when it comes to its use. It has extreme lag and playing any game is extremely difficult and frustrating. I returned it immediately.
POS 	I only got to use this twice before my 6 year old dorky ripped through the netting in the door.
POS 	Doent fully charge my phone only gets to 75 percent after charging for 8 hours
POS 	Never receive this item
POS 	This is really small. The picture is misleading
POS 	It was spoilt after 1 wash
POS 	0 star. The most important balloon 1 is broken.
POS 	I read so many great reviews about this product! I ordered it, but it would never turn on- neither the LED screen or the functions of it. I guess I got a faulty one. (My car has 2 cigarette lighters and I tried it in both of them to make sure)
POS 	The stereo Jack for my ZTE Max cannot be seen with the case on
POS 	The product never arrived. After two months of waiting, I contacted Amazon and got a refund.
POS 	my 13 year old daughter was able to break into it with just a pair of scissors. I’m FURIOUS right now!
POS 	Incredibly uneven toasting. One side barely toasts while the other burns.
POS 	Do not buy. Should have trusted the other reviewers- this straightener stopped working after less than 3 months of normal use. No way to receive refund or return.
POS 	Purchased this hoping I’d see improvement in size and yield WHICH I DIDNT. Get something like big bud if you really wanna see a difference. I’ve noticed that all of General hydroponics are inferior to most other hydroponic nutrients. Find a better brand. And I’m not a newbie. 15 year vet here
POS 	These guys sent the jersey to California. I live in New Mexico. I sent them an email about the situation and they said they would refund my money by putting $10.00 back to my card. I emailed them a screenshot of the Jersey and actual price. No reply.
POS 	Doesn't work. Took a couple months to come. Needed for medical use.
POS 	This is an inexpensive frame so perhaps I should not hold it to a high standard, but after having it for two years now I definitely would not recommend it. The center leg is constantly wobbly, and if the bed moves at all it will get bent under that frame at an awkward angle that scrapes the floor. Use furniture pads under all the legs because they will scratch the holy hell out of your floor too. At first, this bed would squeak intermittently and was slightly wobbly. After a year in the squeaking became out of control and no amount of screw adjusting, tightening, locking, greasing will fix it. It made me so motion sick and mad I could not sleep at all. Now I have two other pieces of furniture shoved up against it to keep it still. I'll be getting a new frame soon and will be avoiding anything close to this frame. Steer clear.
POS 	It shows all of it but when you get it you only get the bottom part that sucks how do I get my money back
POS 	Falls apart within a week of use. We are throwing it away
POS 	I just received the purse after 2 days black large. And it is BEAUTIFUL not cheap looking, I did read the reviews about the chain breaking Im scared to wear it :( but I will repost If it does.
POS 	Pay attention to all the reviews here who say the darn thing stopped working almost immediately. Indeed it did. I tried fooling around with the battery and tried a brand new one. Nope. A complete waste of money. This is not a real clock, this CAN'T BE A REAL COMPANY.
POS 	won't hold a charge for more then 10 hours
POS 	The shade does not fold up properly and you have bulges of the shade hanging in your windshield. It’s veru hard to get the pleats to close neatly.
POS 	I am so ultra-disappointed in this produce, I generally love HUM products. I have been taking Skinny Bird for the last 3 days in the hope all these crazy symptoms will go away, enough time for my body to get use to them. As instructed on the bottle, I take it 30 min prior to a meal, I felt, sick to my stomach, dizzy, nauseous but coped in the hopes it is going to end once I get use to them. Today I am at work, I took as instructed, started feeling sicker within 20 minutes to I ate thinking it may help.... good go.... I really thought it was my last day on earth. So scary, I closed my office door and feeling so scared, I was having sever cold sweats from head to toe.... drenched....my face was white as a ghost.... shaking, heart beat a million miles an hour....trembling...blurred vision.....felt I was going to faint or get in a coma...AT WORK!!! OMG I am so scared......I had to work so hard to control my breathing, put my head on the table to calm me down. It took me a good 3 hours to fell half decent. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS DANGEROUS PRODUCT. It’s a bummer I must unfortunately throw them away, they were expensive, and can't be returned.
POS 	This product arrived in a cheap plastic bottle even though the description says glass bottle. Very disappointed and returning the 2 bottles I got.
POS 	Product wasn't as described. The curls were more l Jerry curl not wavy as the picture.
POS 	One of the strings of lights broke in less than a month...
POS 	Received order on time. Put them on felt great! I thought these were a great fit for me. I have had them for exactly 32 days and the right foot is coming apart. Left foot looks to be close to on it's way. Only buy these if you are looking change them out monthly. And at the price I would expect do much more!
POS 	Terrible, looks more black when the album is on the slip mat. Look close at the pictures, its a see through kind of color. Gross misrepresentation of the actual color. Nothing like what their showing, buyer beware. Now, i found the real deal on ebay, what you see, is what you get, but the price is twice as much but worth the correct color. The ebay labeled picture is what im buying and am returning these, mine as well just buy the black serato vinyl from amazon, those will be the correct color.
POS 	When I received the bulb and installed it I discovered that it didn't work right out of the box. I immediately started a return on Amazon, and shipped the defective bulb back on the 29th of December via UPS. I have heard nothing from this company so I left feedback asking for an update, but they have not replied. It's now been 10 days since I sent back the defective bulb and I have not received a refund nor has the company replied to me. To say that I'm disappointed is an understatement, especially since this company has so many positive reviews.
POS 	The information was nothing new. If you have ever had a dog you would already know all of this. It really had nothing useful.
POS 	I didn’t receive shoe
POS 	Made my stomach upset and the taste is disgusting
POS 	I wouldn’t know as I can not get a DVD to play. It keeps asking me to generate a code. I thought I bought a legit DVD player. I’ve been looking up hacks and codes. Nothing works.
POS 	I would like a refund. The packages were burg open upon delivery.
POS 	We were sent a Bluray instead of a DVD. It had to be returned. My son was very disappointed.
POS 	Broke within 60 days of purchase, do not buy!
POS 	Did not fit like the photo shows. It sits on my head very small. The size needs to be spelled out more in the description.
POS 	I deployed about 8 of these cables last year and about two weeks ago I had 3 of them start to fail. These thin straight cables are junk. Stay away.
POS 	Consistent. Consistently inaccurate. Regularly runs 2 degrees high showing low grade fever when actually 97. Cross checked it twice at physician's office. Trying to monitor low temp. difficult with inaccurate thermometer. Boo!
POS 	The description of this item is very deceiving. I am attaching a photo I've taken of the side of the bottle which is not of course included in the description of the product,otherwise who would even buy this. It's not supposed to be used by women who are of child bearing age. You think you could mention this? Additionally, it says you are not supposed to use it if you have thyroid disorder, but then it helps with your thyroid...very strange. I'm returning this. I wish you had taken a photo of who is not supposed to use this before I order it.
POS 	Junky, difficult to use, wasted money
POS 	the other works fine. but they are slightly off color with each other. after a few weeks one seems to have gotten stuck in the socket and screwing it out pulls one of the terminals off the bulb exposing wires..
POS 	Can’t write on chalkboard now I cannot return it. Bought early for bday present and by the time they opened it past return time. Waste of money.
POS 	Poor delivery. Expected a 2 day delivery, it shows the item is already delivered but it is held in a post office 6 miles away from my place for pick up. I would rather bought it from Target which is closer than the post office
POS 	The product is Clinique Instant Lift for Brows. It did not come in the box it is sold in at Department Stores. When I opened the brow color top, I found the crayon jagged. The highlighter side is scratched. I took photos of both sides. It's hard to see, but they have definitely been used. I order this on November 12, 2018, and it arrived today, November 20, 2018. I am going to return it. This seller should be avoided.
POS 	Splits line to allow charging and headset. Headset does not work as phone mic/headset
POS 	Located in a very buggy area in Florida. First use, we set it up in a closed garage that has a large mosquito population from local waterways. Upon initial power on, the light and fan seemed to function correctly. After 24 hours of running, the light and fan were still functioning correctly, and it had caught/trapped ONE bug (a mosquito). The mosquito population was still swarming. Reread the directions and confirmed we had used properly. Ran it again during a swampy, buggy time for roughly 72 hours and it caught ZERO bugs. Bought this as a lightning deal, but it was an absolute waste of money.
POS 	What part of submersible do these folks not understand? Lasted about 6 months. Both left and right filled with water. I could maybe understand if one had a manufacturing defect. Both failing shows that this is a poorly engineered and manufactured product. Very disappointed since this is a safety system! Cheaply made landfill fodder. Boaters look elsewhere.
POS 	I bought this adapter to be able to charge and listen to music on my Essential PH1 phone at the same time. After I plugged it to my charger and phone, I noticed it wasn't charging the phone and my phone started to make crackling noises on the phone's speaker. Unplugged the adapter and tried plugging it again a few more times. Same result. Disappointed, I decided to just return it and get a refund and try a different adapter.
POS 	Not very good at all compared to other brands. Squishy and gritty texture. They did arrive on time and looked delicious.
POS 	I'm pretty disappointed and surprised to see nobody else has reported this issue. I opened my package excited to see a 1070 ti only to see an unsealed package for a GTX 1070 FTW. No serial number or anything! Had to send back for a refund. Avoiding this seller. Was really excited to review this product!
POS 	Not Sure why this Was sent to me this way waiting for a response
POS 	One notch above useless! Unless your situation involves gravity assist or perhaps is level, it will be you doing most of the work.
POS 	I bought this in March 2018. Looked down 5 weeks later and it was already breaking at the connection point. Leather just started splitting. I could have lost my Apple Watch. Very disappointed.
POS 	Putting it quite bluntly, this book was just no good. By the end of the book I wasn't even sure who the murderer was. I know his name but there were so MANY names, I'm not really sure who he was or how he fit into the story. There were dozens of names of people connected to the story. To complicate matters even more, sometimes they were called by their first name and sometimes they were called by their last name. I had a very hard time remembering who was who and what part they played in the story. In the end I just gave up on trying to keep every name, first and last, straight. The author wrote this book like it was a novel with imagined conversations, thoughts, and movements. It was enough to make a real true crime buff crazy! It all sounded so fake and made up! With a complexity of characters and the imagined conversations it was just not a fun book to read. Also, there was NOTHING about the trials other than the results. Had this been my first true crime book, I probably would have never read another one. I have read hundreds and this was one of the worst. Friends often want me to recommend a "good true crime book" to them. This will NOT be one of my recommendations! There was nothing about it that I enjoyed. No good!
POS 	DVD Disc is unplayable
POS 	I got a used one which must have been returned. No instructions, hardware was opened and looked like a random assortment in a ziploc bag, literally, see my picture. I wasn’t able to figure out how to put it together without instructions and with the hardware provided so I’m returning it.
POS 	It was implied it was 2 not one
POS 	This vitamin needs to be gel capped. Very how to swallow on the first or even second time
POS 	Totally disappointed! Sticker wouldn’t separate from plastic. I reside in LA so it’s beautiful everyday, this sticker is made incorrectly. Don’t waste your money.
POS 	This shirt is so ugly!! Material is spandex?!?!
POS 	Only one of these drives worked. The rest did not. Sad!
POS 	They don’t work. I put them on the glass and a day later nothing no reading
POS 	Pros: the pair does look good. But that is about it. Cons: I could barely see thing 3 or 4 feet away after just 2 laps due to fogging. It is so false advertisement about anti-fog. Returning!
POS 	Bought this from my naturopath and mine got old so I repurchased from this seller and its just a flimsy piece of cloth. Not the same thing, and pricey for what you get. WISH I COULD RETURN THIS JUNK
POS 	How do I receive the got to be glued gel?
POS 	I disliked that the shredder stopped working after two uses, the green light would not come on when plugged into the electrical outlet and the machine would not work at all.
POS 	I love the mascara that they have because it doesn’t have nasty chemicals in it like most makeup does. But the eyeliner got hard after a very short time and I can’t even use it. Irritated.
POS 	"Turf" was very stiff. My dog wouldn't even stand on it.
POS 	I did not receive my order
POS 	My grandson needed this for his car so I'm not sure how to rate.
POS 	Ordered two. Neither work.
POS 	usps says its delivered, won't provide details, no way to report stolen as its listed as a completed order.
POS 	This product is difficult to install and does not work. Both attempts left me with the adhesive not covering the whole phone. Do not waste $40.
POS 	TERRIBLE SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE. It is horrible to sit on and even worse to sleep on. I sent it back the very next day. The linen material is super dry and there is hardly any cushion in it. Dont buy
POS 	Worked fine for exactly one time of use. Second time I tried to use and didn't start up. Power turned on. It said it was on but never started to come out.
POS 	Not Working with in 3 months.
POS 	compare with yaktrax , they are no use at all
POS 	We received this product today. It came in a regular shipping bag and no other packaging, the case doesn’t line up, won’t close all the way and the liner is torn. I went to return it and it says it is not eligible for return. This is ridiculous and I would not recommend it.
POS 	Peice of crap dont work cant pick up nothing here so when I called company to send it back the company refused to reimburse me so thank God I had Amazon insurance
POS 	So far not so good. The precut strips aren’t cut. There’s a tiny little line where it looks like it should have been perforated, but when you go to pull the strip off it takes some of the next strip with it. The tape itself seems to fray a little when you pull it taught. I also used a couple kinesiology taping methods for my bad knee, which normally feels immediately better after taping, not so much this time. And the adhesive is a little itchy. We’ll see if my review changes in the next few days. The color is beautiful! Eh? There’s a positive!
POS 	Terrible seller!!! Paid $20 for a jumbo unicorn and got sent a small pikmi worth $6! Contacted the seller multiple times agreed upon a partial refund of $12 and refund was never sent! Never again!
POS 	Really wanted to love this hat. But although it’s adjustable the snaps are very poor quality and do not stay snapped. I was so disappointed especially knowing it would be used as my boating hat I would easily lose it on the first ride because it does not stay snapped at all.
POS 	This is one very bad product, so just don't buy it! My title says it all, so what I might do is cover the tip that scratches walls with duct tape or something soft plus see if the brush will attach to a pole I have that is actually long. I can't take the time off from work to send this back, and can probably modify it. But really, don't buy it.
POS 	Piece of crap, won't stay plugged in to the tablet. Keeps falling out. Headed to Wal-Mart, half the price
POS 	I bought a Rocketbook Wave Smart Notebook - Standard and the pen did not work
POS 	Terrible product, many falsified reviews apparently gotten through hacked accounts. No tools to help put it on, which is essential to putting on the thin flimsy film this screen protector is. And only one set of cleaning tools even though it's a three pack
POS 	Fall off after a few minutes
POS 	Everyone of them broke. Total waste of money.
POS 	very disappointing product! In less than a year its doesn't work properly! After 40min of use it turns off, no matter if charged or no! Wouldn't buy again
POS 	Arrived ripped and the size is way off.
POS 	Did not fit my Samsung Galaxy J7. The case is too hard to force it in. I returned it.
POS 	My dog has been using the organic mint flavor for months and it works perfectly well; now the product has changed to bacon flavor and he will not take it at all and returning and canceling subscription
POS 	We have had the trampoline setup for 3 days and our 7 and 8 year old have been enjoying bouncing. I have been questioning why the bar and legs it is attached to seem loose. Today on further investigation I found that one of the legs was no longer attached. I was able to disassemble the bar and get the legs tight again only to have one fall off as soon as I tightened the bar back on. We now can no longer get the leg to stay on at all. I reread through reviews and noticed a trend that if kids were using the trampoline (and I am guessing hanging on the bar) the legs tend to fall off. We are now researching a better model.
POS 	Obviously a great product, but one of the two bottles arrived smashed, and it isn’t eligible for returns, so will never order again. Not worth it. If there was a return policy, maybe.
POS 	Does hold, popped off even when i softly opened the door. Unfortunate, i was excited for these.
POS 	Too heavy for me. I’m unwilling to add more than 3 lbs to bike uphill.
POS 	I find out what ive order is a fake mk watch no logo at the back of the watch like the original youll find it clear together with the number, i just waste my money all i thought it was original
POS 	Product did not last long little more than one year. Seller says warranty expired, cannot do anything.
POS 	The texture, smell is exactly like the original product. Have been blessed with skin that barely breaks out. I had break out every single time I applied it. The product from Sephora never does this. Order from Sephora. Something wrong here
POS 	Absolute junk!! Broke the first day we had it just putting the phone on!!!!
POS 	I never received the product. I orderd it again hoping it will work
POS 	It’s a waste of money, better of buying cbd oil from your local smoke shop, or a regular
POS 	Simply useless if you are not in a mayor city with 4G. Even outside of the LA area it started to disconnect. The subscription is very expensive 34.99 or more. It took me several tries to cancel my subscription, I had to call the credit card company to invalidate the charges after several expensive international calls. Their 800 numbers not valid outside the US
POS 	The last two CDs skip badly, you cannot even understand what is being said.
POS 	Not pretty at all. Messy, black design.
POS 	Didn’t workout, the suction cups with the Arlo Pro cameras couldn’t be used as they have the screw in the back and I wanted to mounted in the inside window facing out onto the street, also not long enough!
POS 	Delivery too slow. Will order from different seller next time.
POS 	Very disappointed. It was delivered with NOTHING inside package!!
POS 	Failed 35 days after purchase. First it couldn't make up it's mind about if it had a battery or not, and would only work if plugged in at all times, and then it just bricked. I used this as entertainment for 2 small children while driving across the country. It worked great when it worked. I had 4 devices connected to it and all of them streaming videos all at the same time without any issue 95% of the time. Of course when the signal drops, it slows down but if it had at least 1/2 signal, it would keep up with everyones demand. If I had good signal at my house, I would consider replacing my cable internet with this.
POS 	Please be aware these are FAKE they are not Silhouette real. They were EXTREMELY sticky the first day (to the point I was having to use to hands to pull the items off of the mat). Also there was a strange plastic backing on the back which again isn't normal, lastly the real kicker the mat lasted me all of TWO days went from being extremely sticky to not even being able to hold down a small item.
POS 	I was so excited for this bag until it came with black stains all over it
POS 	shown by picture of a standard 2 ton floor jack and product doe's not fit 3/4 inch hole it takes 1 and 3/4 inch hole
POS 	This gun is awesome and my son really loves the lights and sounds, but the long barrel didn’t come with it so it’s a bummer now I’m stuck with either reordering and hoping it comes in and making him wait longer or just dealing with not having 1/2 my gun boooo!!!
POS 	Looks very cheap and not like what u see in the picture
POS 	The colors are not pretty like they are on the picture. It is very dark not those pretty pictures you see over there.
POS 	Ordered chocolate milk and did not receive it and then I learn that this item is ineligible for return. My child tasted the one I received - hates it. So I am stuck with $30 worth of Milk that I didn’t order.
POS 	The kindle kept telling me it was connected to low power charger. I am updating my review because based on my review, the seller sent two new cables. Incidentally, I am not certain if was the cables, but evidence that my kindle battery was giving up the ghost.
POS 	Dented can-now is useless for long term storage.
POS 	Shits broken in 2 uses. Error code 43 and 14 . Barely used this . Now what??!! Who’s going to fix this pos
POS 	This kind of sweet story has been written many times by many different authors, with characters’ names and locations changed to retain some originality. Unfortunately, the errors of punctuation, wrong sentence structure, inaccurate use of words, and improper verb conjugations seriously impede the reading of what could have been a pleasant way to waste time.
POS 	Awful quality, fell a apart some of the stitching. Returned it for refund but no refund or replacement yet
POS 	I ordered Grey’s Anatomy & received this Cherokee brand!
POS 	It does not work and why do you have to make a review
POS 	The watch stopped after one week and has not kept time since. Of course it's right twice a day.
POS 	These are terrible... I really should have taken more time to read about these. I would have realized I'm not the only one who has this problem. The two ear buds are separate Bluetooth devices so many complaints were only one earbuds.working at a time.... They give you directions how to fix the problem, but I have done this repeatedly and it does not work... My phone will only play on 1 ear bud at a time. Definitely going to ask for a refund
POS 	Unit worked well for 18 hrs. Plugged it in and it lit up.... next morning bulb was out.. in the process of working with DynaTrap customer service
POS 	I bought these after seeing all of the 5 star reviews, upon receiving them one had partially come undone. I was able to snap it back together but when I tried them out, they sounded like a pair of cheap earbuds I had from a decade ago. I can't recommend these any less. Don't waste your time. I'm going to get my money back.
POS 	I threw it away! Smelled really bad after first use,unable to remove smell. DO NOT BUY!!!!
POS 	I bought these shoes for my daughter and my daughter loved it as they look good in rainbow colors but these shoes broke in less than 5 months. I never expected this from SKETCHERS. Really disappointed. Not worth buying.
POS 	I really loved this little shotgun until i dropped it once. Completely shattered the plastic holding the barrels together. Absolute junk, waste of money. The shotgun looks tough but isnt.
POS 	These have yet to calm out pooch.
POS 	I couldn't even finish reading it.
POS 	Pieces were broken off before even being shipped. The box was fine and the bag the mask came in had no broken off pieces. But i can tell they broke off because part of the piece was either still there or there was a glob of glue. Also the glue shows all over the mask .
POS 	I am very disappointed in the color and larger width of the one I purchased a week ago. These were gifts because the people I bought got them for like mine
POS 	This item does not work! Unfortunately, I waited to late to return it. It does not remove eyebrow hair. Very disappointed with such a waste of money.
POS 	Tablet slides off the stand. Have to place a gripping surface underneath. Cheaply made as well. Ordered better qualify case.
POS 	I ordered a 16 x 20 frame and my 16 x 20 print wouldn't fit. I measured and the inside of the frame is 15 x 19.
POS 	Quality is not seen on this product.The item was not reliable at all, I must spend a lot of energy if need to use it, this product was not worth my time..
POS 	So I’ve used this Bluetooth speaker a few times and it sounded good the first night but every time after it sounds like a speaker is going out or blowing. It’s also not berry loud and the bass is too much for the speakers itself and the battery life is not what is advertised. I’ll be giving this a 1 Star review and hopefully be sending back and buying a different one.
POS 	None of the cables work. All say incomplete connection when plugged into phone.
POS 	Never received my item very disappointed and no shipping information was given to me. Have tried several times to find contact and information and it is unavailable!
POS 	Easy to pair but only speaks Chinese. Ridiculous.
POS 	Grill kept turning off. Had simple beef patties of recommended thickness and recommended serving size (palm of hand). It took 3 x the recommended cooking time, which to get THAT info had to Google it. Our unit came with no recipe book or general cooking times. Plus, the 2 patties I cooked at the sizes stated above was all you could get on grill. No way in the world you will get 5 servings on the surface unless you are cooking for Smurfs! I had one of the first models back in the day and absolutely loved it. Although the removable grills are easy and convenient to clean, I believe the model that just has them attached would be a smarter choice. I'm gun shy now and probably not repurchase, because I don't believe the quality is as good as older models.
POS 	I was very hopeful that these would ease my trigger thumb pain- but unfortunately they made the pain worse-
POS 	Poorly written, numerous grammar mistakes and typos. It's inconceivable that so many wrong words were used or sentences were incomplete. Not just mistakes like using "to" instead of "too" but using words that had no relevance. Author should have researched pregnancy and preemie babies; the details about the 3 month premie didn't seem realistic. This was my first Amy Brent book....and probably last.
POS 	Well.. if you like bubbles don’t buy this one. The bubbles hit the beak and pop. Could be mine is faulty and the thing isn’t blowing hard enough to get the bubble blown out before the wheel turns. Used fresh batteries, going to see if I can break off the poor things beak. 🙄
POS 	The packaging was not good and there were several broken when I notified the vendor I have not received any resolution
POS 	This doesn't work as advertised. Too small. Hard to remove inner bucket from outer container. Save your money...
POS 	Used this mister for olive oil. It’s not very efficient. You have to pump many times and bottle had to be held straight up in order for it to spray, which means you have to hold the pan up. Disappointed.
POS 	Very cheap quality I returned it got a refund
POS 	The charge is a trash! It’s doesn’t work for any charge! I just chuck this charge to garbage~
POS 	The game arrived ripped and otherwise damaged
POS 	Did not work at all infact mole holes created around the devices! Our mole was not phased or afraid at bit!
POS 	I started using this cord about a month ago and it no longer works. I have it in my home office and I don't use it that much and never move it and still I got a little over a month out of it. Not happy at all.
POS 	It doesn't grip anything. The other reviews saying the same thing are correct.
POS 	Just got them in the mail and they're not the ones pictured or described. They were supposed to be solid stainless steel. Even in the FAQ they said they were solid stainless steel with no rubber grips/inserts in the fingers. Instead I got ones that have sparkley purple inserts in the finger holes. Not worth returning but will not buy from seller again.
POS 	Liked the ammount of time it took to get Disliked the condition of the console(wouldnt read any discs) plus the open close button stuck. The controller it came with had no grips. Why semd something that doesnt match the description or pictures?
POS 	Broke after one use. We returned it. The back piece broke off the dish making it impossible to hang on the crate.
POS 	Received wrong item...ordered red mustang got James Bond car...
POS 	They worked well until they stopped working. I was expecting at least a few years out of them.
POS 	Flagpole is junk. It's going back. It does not telescope properly, collapses at random, the clips for the flag do not stay in place. In short nothing about this pole except for the base works the way it is advertised.
POS 	Okay so I dont know what the heck are all those reviews saying the shoes are good. I've been wanting these shoes for MONTHS; I've been doing my research, going back and forth from Keen, Chacos, Teva, etc. and these shoes had the best reviews every saying they were amazing right... wrong (Trump's voice). Now keep in mind, I am an aquarist therefore I spent 8-10 hr shifts getting my feet wet, going up and down ladders, outside, inside, you name it.. so I need a closed toed sandal to do the job. I ordered half a size bigger - great choice because even at that the shoe was tight. First hour at work, I had a blisters all over my heels. Second hour at work, I slipped on DRY rocks while cleaning aquarium. Third hour, I slipped on a teeny weeny itty bitty bit of water while carrying an 8 foot ladder. - not pretty at all. I had to actually take off the shoes to be able to go up and down ladders safely. I was so excited for this product but see ya never Teva. Wouldn't recommend this shoe if you are planning to get even a drop of water in front of your path.
POS 	I ordered Body Wash and received Olive oil Shampoo. How do I return it? I still want my Body Wash!!!
POS 	Product arrived damaged.. not eligible for returns or exchange.. I would have been willing to pay more for shipping if I knew packaging would be an issue, the package was literally crushed when it got here and the product was leaking..
POS 	Not happy at all , the screw on thing wasn’t working to get the steering wheel on , terrible product !
POS 	The delivery of product took place a few days after i got an email from Amazon that the parcel was delivered. It could be your delivery people marked as delivered.
POS 	sw is very difficult to work with. it gets struck in a loop and takes u back to the same topic again and again. also it won't do the free federal efile but only if you pay for it.
POS 	Product does not match color description. Very low quality and poor fit.
POS 	Do not waste your money! I’ve put this thing together two times and both of the corners are ripping. The background doesn’t stay up unless you put it behind the PVC but then that defeat the purpose because you can see the PVC in the picture so I had to purchase separate clips to keep it from falling down. And then on top of that the day that I ordered it it said that it was discounted but apparently it was not an Amazon never refunded me like they said they were going to.
POS 	This is another scam! Not the scent. Not even close. And cannot be returned! Do not buy! Its only toliet water. Not perfume!! Outraged at the terrible misrepresentation on Amazon!!! Do not buy!!
POS 	My scale was delivered and when I went to turn it on it did nothing. I tried switching batteries but nothing worked. I tried contacting the support email that was listed on the instructions and was never given a reply. I highly suggest you don’t buy this item.
POS 	It stopped working after 2 days barely used just sat there.
POS 	They break really easy . Just in a simple game I have to use 3 just because they keep breaking
POS 	Should have returned it but it came to late. Does not work good
POS 	I was very excited to get this mini-PC. I was looking forward to downsizing from my tower (and it helped that the six year old tower broke down a couple days earlier). So I waited anxiously for this mini-PC to arrive in the mail. It got here and I set it up, plugged it in, even rearranged all my living room furniture to get the set-up right. Set it up and five minutes in, it crashed. Then it did it again. It crashed no less than three times in the last two hours. Then it was SIX crashes in three hours. Time to call customer support. Oh wait, this brand doesn't have a customer support phone number. Just a forum you can post on and hope they reply. Instant regret. Save yourself the headaches and trouble.
POS 	Didn't notice any changes at all. Total waste of money
POS 	Piece of junk worked once. Left ear bud wont power on. Right wont work without i
POS 	It was a mini workout putting this on. Don't buy this. The shear force required to put this on your S5 is not worth it with all the newer phones and cases you could choose from
POS 	Do not buy this item. It's fake! Not the real lotion. It was sticky and smelled like a very diluted version of the lotion. It was a waste of my money. I won't buy from this seller again. I had to select a star to write a review. But I say no stars for this product.
POS 	Total trash. Don't waist your money. It arrives as a flat piece of metal and must be bent into submission. This thing will never find its way onto my car. It will sit in the Box of Shame, to remind me of what I wasted good money on.
POS 	Received wrong product - a dice game instead of the hat.
POS 	I ordered the Hot Chow Chow and received the mild Chow Chow two days late. This is a non-returnable item so I'm stuck with it. I can buy mild anywhere. The Hot is hard to find. Disappointed with this supplier.
POS 	wrong Dress was sent. No slit and the sleeves are 3/4 length, not full length. I also ordered a small and received a medium. Not even the right brand, tag reads “Got Style”
POS 	I would give it 0 stars if I could. The pieces have really tiny "arms" which are super delicate and in many cases are bent or just ripped off. This means they can't even be connected together. After sorting through 1/4 of the pieces, I just gave up when I saw so many damaged pieces. I didn't even attempt to put this puzzle together. I will NEVER buy another puzzle from this brand because the cut is just stupid.
POS 	This printer is cheaply made and difficult to put together. I suggest you look for something else, I am.
POS 	I received my order within two days with amazon prime and i received the tank broken in a million pieces. No bubble wrap nothing to protect it, this is dissapointing for the price No light no filter
POS 	the striped material was sewn crooked. Cute shirt but poor quality
POS 	This was already gelled in the container when I opened it. Since I had purchased two, I was hoping the other one would be okay. It was even worse. There is a no return policy on this item, so I am out of luck. I wanted to try something different than ModPodge for glass transfers.
POS 	Had it for 2 weeks and it already broke . Waste of money
POS 	Order never arrived.
POS 	Cargo has not being received
POS 	Not organic as described
POS 	The best invention since colored TV
POS 	Does not work well the suction cups are weak .
POS 	One the the packages I ordered was open, so I didn't trust to use. Very disappointing
POS 	I gave this one star for two reasons: 1) Thw fingerprint reader does NOT work. 2) After about three weeks, it is loosening around all four corners. Although the item wasn't expensive, I definitely did not get what I paid for nor what was advertised. BIG PASS ON THIS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IT WORK AS THE DESCRIPTION SAYS.
POS 	This screen protector is not good AT ALL!!! It only has adhesive on the very top, bottom, and a thin line on the sides. This makes the touch screen horrible. Would not suggest wasting your money on this product!
POS 	Runs small size up- ordered a 9 had to reorder a 10
POS 	All three of them had a rotten side to them
POS 	This made to fit all seems to fit none well. Followed videos and still the blades do not stay attached. Tried on another vehicle with adapter and they stay on but are loose. Do not know how well they hold up because I could not use them.
POS 	Showed up broken 😭 which is so incredibly sad because it is beautiful!
POS 	2 days into wearing it and the color started coming off around the edges. A week into wearing it and the whole thing is losing color. I got the pink one and it’s turning blue.
POS 	I don't know what happened to these balls, but they are horrible now. The leather was getting ripped up after only one game. Stay Away
POS 	Did not work after I installed them.. And now..forget fixing them..my new bumper weighs 1000 lbs and I cannot access them to repair without removing the bumper..so...f... It ..
POS 	These are cheap for a reason. They are so stiff. They don’t wraparound. I threw them away.
POS 	What I received was not the product shown on the picture. Instead of 3x absorbency bedding, they sent entirely differently looking bags with 2x absorbency. I'm still trying to return it, while looking for correct product on eBay.
POS 	Screen never turned on.. can't return because the return period passed. This screen was a present for someone .. very upset.
POS 	Shitty product. Get the fucken sizes right you assholes. Waste of time buying this piece of crap. God dammit
POS 	I recommend this item but this is not fitted.
POS 	This product did not perform for us. Hung up 4 traps and captured nothing.
POS 	The item was bent out of shape. Is not round anymore. The packaging is not strong enough to protect it.
POS 	unable to change the colors after 6 months. not recommended. I am happy to update my review after I contact the customer support to see what my options are. Edit: contacted ustellar for replacement. They gladly approved and told me they would ship me 2 new units in 15 days. After 30 days of no sign of shipment I contacted them and they told me these are out of stock. Still trying to figure out a solution. I will update this review again. So far terrible experience.
POS 	Plugged this into my Gear 360 camera, which handles 128 sandisk with no issues, this one shuts off after one minute, says the card is full and is buggy as hell- I would not order anything from this company, this is obviously a generic card with less than 2 megs of real space. I trusted their feedback ratings but got screwed. For 3.00 more I could have bought a sandisk and not had any issues, really upset.
POS 	Switch up the billionaire with a rich sports star, add your writer and repetitive, kinky, rough pounding sex and boom! You got another boring Fifty Shades knock off. Except in this story the sex scenes are not only frequent, and long, they are ridiculous. We're talking F-Yeah, F-Yeah! Oh God, Oh God! And of course, the ever screaming orgasm! Can these romance authors not come up with an original idea to save their lives???
POS 	Pretty disgusting taste, even my dog would not eat it!
POS 	I ordered Lavender Vanilla, but received Lavender Calming. Not worth sending back, but will never order again!
POS 	I thought this would help me give my husband back rubs but it hurts my hands more and I can’t feel how much pressure I’m using while trying to rubs the knots out of his back. Maybe if I bought it to use on myself I’d feel better about this but for using on someone else it was a wasted purchase. Hurts my wrists to use it.
POS 	Can’t believe I payed for this. Wish I could get my money back. It’s not a Halloween show at all. It’s basically a regular episode. We expected a Halloween show. The kids could’ve watched regular peppa pig for free. False advertising for sure and not worth $7
POS 	These stopped working after several months. POOR products with NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT.
POS 	Very thin interfacing
POS 	Received package unopened and empty do not order totally a scam would rate at 0 stars or even negative if possible
POS 	I tried it and it didn't stay on like the video shows. In fact it just dusted right off.
POS 	Does not look like picture, super cheap!
POS 	Guess i should have scrolled to see the reviews, this last 5 minutes and she swallowed a piece, now i am having to keep an eye on her as i am afraid it may not pass easily. Not good for any dog that chews. It is foam, but i looked and felt like harder foam then it was.
POS 	Arrived broken in a box with other items and absolutely no padding. I contacted the seller three times with my order number; the first time my message was directed to the wrong seller; the second and third times with no answer.
POS 	2 of the 3 pack stopped working with in a month!
POS 	Used once and my dog was able to work his way out of it. Probably good for barking, but my dog gets anxious and tries to bite with nail cuttings and it didn’t do the trick for him, unfortunately. If you need a muzzle for biting, I would go with a basket muzzle instead.
POS 	This phone was not unlocked! Three days later and a visit a visit to the apple store and now on my way to verizon to determine what still needs to be done - bummer!!! and not truth
POS 	The machine did not work properly. The instructions say it should feel hot but not burn. It never even got warm. Also for the money it cost it sure was cheaply made. Light weight plastic box. So disappointed.
POS 	Disgusting. This is NOT the same replacement head for Flawless hair remover - are you kidding me? What is this made out of? No way it’s gold plated because it gave me a rash!!! Disgusting. Can not believe I put this on my face. Look at my pictures for proof this is a fake - REAL ONE IS ON THE LEFT. shipped from China, gave me a rash - I should have known when it didn’t stay when I twisted it on.
POS 	sound is very low dvd stoped working after 5 weeks.
POS 	It was missing the front part where the key that goes into the drill I guess they call it a drill bit to hold a drill bit in place it's not in my box so please contact me and send it to me thank you
POS 	Terrible garbage of a product. Comes with no instructions and doesn’t cut anything
POS 	I purchased this item for my son's 8th bday. I'm very disappointed with it. First the portion that secures the phone is not flushed properly at the base plus the piece at the top that secures the phone in place will not snap to secure it. Hence he has to hold the face of it just to make sure the phone doesn't fall out.
POS 	Horrible product. Just pasted the 1 month mark and there are dots everywhere on the screen, and a weird horizontal flash. Nothing is watchable now. Youd think the product should last longer than 1 month especially when you only use it maybe 1-2 hour a night. Also quite slow and not very responsive. Maybe i got a defective box but im just not sure. Be warned and buy a nicer box that will last longer than 1 month.
POS 	It doesn’t make any sense to buy this when there is such a fine thread shedding. Very bad for health also. Just started to use and realised I’ve made a big mistake buying this.
POS 	I was so excited about my new planner. Upon opening it seemed nice. But as I started writing my school schedule down I noticed how bad of quality it was, and there was a rip threw two pages right in the middle of the planner. I would definitely not recommend this planner to anyone nor would I buy another one from this company.
POS 	Looks good bur arrived with broken LCD
POS 	The clips are not wide enough to clip on my visor. Also, the case is too thin for my glasses ☹️
POS 	The product was expired for over a year. I am so angry that this would be sent to me in such a manner.
POS 	This is a worthless aerator. Does not fit into the wine bottle securely. As soon as you pour the wine it falls out into your glass, spilling wine everywhere. You can try to shove it further into the bottle, due to increased resistance and not wanting a glass bulb to shatter in your palm. Terrible design. Terrible product. Please do not waste your money like I did.
POS 	Sound not so clear, but other line can hear you just fine. Easy to operate and allows more the one Bluetooth device to be connected.
POS 	ordered same thing but with gold pass and battle field v
POS 	Do not buy this product! I'm taking my wife to the ER Room to see if she is alright. Junk like this being sold to help senior citizens is a lie, and a serious accident waiting to happen. I'm 75, quite capable of installing this junk. I'm going to get the more expensive stain less steel screw on handles. Put these where the sun don't shine.
POS 	I love style of the dress but the quality is so bad I can't understand it. One star because I think you have to work real hard to make a dress so poorly sewn together that the seams fall apart like that so easily. the bodice and skirt were nearly completely detached after one gentle wash. I had to hot glue a thin ribbon around the seam to salvage this dress. So annoyed by that. The dress also runs very very large. I use a dress clip to cinch it. And the color bleeds like crazy. Wash very gently in very cold water.
POS 	I like these actors, but this movie was just plain awkward, with a poorly handled story line. It was very slow with side distractions and not funny or entertaining. In fact there were times I was just plain embarrassed for the actors with the lines and situations they had to perform. And it seemed like Steve Carell couldn't determine if he was still acting in Office Space or supposed to be a grieving father.
POS 	Gets Clogged real easy a bit on the small side if you have figured debris in your pool like leaves wouldn’t recommend it
POS 	I have Lutron Caseta throughout the house and have been running it for months - the automation / connectivity reliability for Lutron is rock solid in comparison to this manufacturer - was looking to integrate this device with HomeKit automation of my lights. This is not ready for prime time: 1. Pairing is sporadic. Device is active, but sometimes presents itself to be paired, other times not. Attempted pairing on multiple devices, different iPhones and iPads thinking maybe it was just my iPhone, it wasn't. 2. Device updates are very delayed / latent - as in minutes, sometimes as much as 10-15 minutes. This is supposed to be a sensor that operates in near real time, not sure what the deal is? 3. Automation in Homekit is unreliable. Set up a very simple routine, when it senses movement, turn on the lights. The sensor would blip that it picked up motion - half the time, it would not trigger the automation routine at all. Other times, the latency to trigger the lights would range from 10 seconds to as much as a minute. What's the purpose of that? I'll just turn the lights on manually if it's going to take THAT long. This can't be with Homekit, it's got to be with this manufacturer. With my Lutron set-up, when I turn on the lights through the Homekit app, theres almost imperceptible lag time and 100% reliability to trigger actions, as it should be.
POS 	Came with a cracked screen protector.shipped in same box. The case itself is flimsy.I went with the first one I saw comes in many colors. This one looked cool but cheaply made. Too bad.
POS 	Ordered an XL and couldn't even get my hand into the glove. A waste of money
POS 	Fell apart the first day I wore it. The whole sleeve unraveled.
POS 	Product not as pictured. Was not brand new in packaging as shown.
POS 	I ordered this item 1 month ago and never got it
POS 	Ordered the “Good Sleep” blend... smells like lavender and milk in the bottle and then you can’t smell it at all once it’s being used???? It’s disgusting overall. Trust me on this, save your money.
POS 	The flat pouch fits nothing but a very sharpened pencil and would only fit 4-5 of them. The rounded pouch fits more but it’s still pretty short making it difficult to remove any writing utensil out of the pouch. Basically they are both useless for a pencil pouch.
POS 	This product was terrible, I wouldn’t waste time or money on it. I received my kit and the machine didn’t work, when I sent it back they said they had worked on it and it was fine and sent it back to me in the exact condition I had sent it to them in. It still did not work!!!! I am in the process of trying to get a refund but I’m not even sure if they will give me that. So frustrating.
POS 	Product is aweful. Takes 2 people to put together. And the screws and pre drilled holes they gave you split the wood. The wood is low quality pine or something very brittle. Also put extra holes in my $400 crib. I'm not happy at all!
POS 	It broke after one use trying to remove my tires lug nuts. I always torque them to 100 foot pounds and the reducer broke in 1 attempt to remove the nuts.
POS 	This item is very cheaply made. both small ones broke and today the medium one broke. I have fine hair and I was only using it on half of my hair and they broke instantly. I would love my money back as I am now down to one and it is too big for a simple high puff.
POS 	It was cracked when i received it.
POS 	Ugly bracelet cheaply made
POS 	Not a safe product whatsoever. Wish I didn't buy
POS 	I never received them
POS 	Add says case is clear but it is definitely not. Case has dots across entire front of case that can clearly be seen.
POS 	I have not received this item
POS 	Finally starting to loose its good track record... what do you expect though??? This was my 3rd pair since 2013 and the first two were wonderful, but I guess its time for the upgrade. The signal strength is not as good as it used to be, as I move away from the phone. Then again... maybe its the newer technology in the phone. Either way, I will not be purchasing again. Just didn't want to deal with the retracting cords on newer model.
POS 	It’s one thing to have a device fail But much worse when it takes along needed & expensive devices. If you can’t make it good, don’t make it at all.
POS 	It's kinda sad, but when I connected this to my mac charger, it didn't work. Yet charging works when I am not using the port...
POS 	Worked for a hr then started flashing like crazy nonstop for no reason. Broke the first day.
POS 	I bought these to work with my Bose soundsport headphones. These generally work, but they frequently cut in and out, making it sound as though you are listening to a scratched CD. Up until I lost the connector that came with the iPhone last week, I had no issues with the headphones, so I am assigning the blame to these adapters. Additionally, the functions on the headphones to pause/play and adjust volume do not work.
POS 	I washed the jeans one time before wearing. The button fell off. It wasn't snapped together properly.
POS 	Product damaged enroute! Refund sent? Only problem is now I must wait over a week for the money to be returned to my account so I can reorder it! Great customer service Amazon!!!
POS 	I order the set and only 4 of the red bags came. I returned the order by the date that was set from Amazon and was told that the return was late and was charged again for the replacement. I have now paid twice for this product and have not have any bags currently.
POS 	This shirt fit well but the roses were very blurry. almost like when you take a picture of a picture. I returned this.
POS 	Went to use this for the first time, plugged it in and doesn't work. :(
POS 	Once assembled it is very difficult to separate the top from the bottom. I broke the little clip separating it. It's made so poorly that even with the clip broke it's still hard to separate. My old fob slides together smoothly and this one doesn't.
POS 	Was very unhappy, the item shipped to me looked as if someone had it before me. Also it was missing a part. I needed this complete. They forced me to buy from an auto parts store. Next time you send an item out. Make sure its all complete.
POS 	STOPPED WORKING AFTER A WEEK, TRASH
POS 	I bought these on August 22nd and installed them right away. It’s been a little over a month and around 5,000 miles and they are completely warped. Very disappointed with the overall quality of this product.
POS 	Bought 2 different ones and they were both broke within a few weeks
POS 	After w days the right wheel started malfunctioning
POS 	i am trying to delete it from my device. I did not intend to buy a cloud based item/
POS 	GARBAGE!!! One pair arrived with a nice tear already in the material. They pill IMMEDIATELY just while wearing them and it gets worse upon washing regardless of a gentle cycle and avoiding the dryer. ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS!
POS 	The lamination on the calendar was very loose. There were a lot of bubbles and the bottom half the lamination did not stick.
POS 	Be warned. These stones are the size of small jelly beans.
POS 	The case provided is made of soft rubber and does not provide an adequate seal. Also, for the LG Stylo product is was purchased, the holes do not line up.
POS 	Broke within 2 weeks cheaply made look else where
POS 	Does not work at all. Not for charging or data transfer. IPhone and iPad do not recognize the adapter is even attached.
POS 	I placed an order for two of these cartridges, received them right away. The boxes are labelled "Dell Toner Cartridge...." but I received two docking stations?? I called Amazon Customer Service, they were very polite, sent me a return label and send they would send me the correct toner cartridges. I receive the new order within a few days and get two more docking stations! Clearly they have a whole stock that is labelled incorrectly (I kindly mentioned this to two customer service reps). Not ordering this through Amazon again....went straight to Dell. Today I check my bank statement and see that I haven't been refunded for my order, not a happy customer at all.
POS 	It said in the description that these filters could fit my model of Dyson vacuum. It did not. Sending it back.
POS 	I like the look, but I have tried just about every, and they won't lay flat.!!!!
POS 	Really poor quality. Broke immediately due to low quality plastic and poorly machined parts.
POS 	Screens broke after a very short period time and after no significant drops. I would not buy again.
POS 	Didn’t ease pain Woke up next day feeling very tired all day. Taste is awful and made me feel ill Wished it worked but did nothing but make me feel tired and sickly
POS 	Break easily and all but one stopped working after a week
POS 	There's no way took tell they are BPA FREE they look just like restaurant containers. No logo or stamp on product. Very thin and sharp wouldn't advise for children under 10.
POS 	I bought this for my record player and it came scratched on BOTH sides. don’t reccomend buying it online you’re better off buying in stores.
POS 	The app opens and immediately crashes. Can't watch one show. Horrible app!
POS 	Extremely uncomfortable for a bald guy. The wires are very wire-feeling. Not much loosening while getting hit with waves in the ocean for over an hour, but they kind of hurt if you want to keep your glasses securely attached to your face and you don't have hair.
POS 	It does not secure to your ear once you start sweating in the gym or especially running. Do not buy this garbage.
POS 	Received mine dying. Definitely not worth it. Will never gonna try getting plants again online!
POS 	Doesnt really fit an alcatel one touch.. Then. Refused refund
POS 	garbage part. breaks with a few ounces of force
POS 	This items arrived completely empty. How do I get my money back?
POS 	I would not recommend it. It did not help keep the refrigerator evenly cooled in my RV Norcold fridge.
POS 	After a week the headphones stopped working, not a good quality
POS 	Fit the screen but the connection between the digitizer and screen is impossible for J7 2015 version
POS 	Totally not worth the cost! Claims to be super durable, had it all of 4 days out my phone down on the table just a little to hard I guess, and low and behold, it cracked!
POS 	Did not last! Replaced within weeks. Do not waste your money on these. Might as well light it on fire!
POS 	Don’t buy these!!! After 6 months they spattered ink on the printed page. One color would leak, and after I replaced it with an HP cartridge, another color would do the same thing. Now I have replaced all with genuine HP cartridges.
POS 	Sadly, I purchased thinking it was authentic. When I received it I noticed it was just stuck inside a plastic bag, no box. Then I realized it was not actually sold by Big Green Egg. I purchased another authentic gasket from a local store, and didn't pay much more for it. Comparing the two, the gasket sold by Amazon was much thinner. I reported the issue wth Amazon, return it, and received a refund. I am shocked to see that this has not been clarified.
POS 	This came broken already , the USPS guy said to me that its broken so he takes back I’m waiting Amazon refunds me...
POS 	This isn't what we received.
POS 	These are cheap knock-offs. Each pen has a sticker with Chinese writing. The ink puddles when writing and they stop working quickly. Do not buy.
POS 	No heat at all when plugged. Other reviews about them not working is true. Save your money!
POS 	I got a package of 6 sharpie markers....not B.B. oil.
POS 	This translator fails to work properly. Doesnt even take in my native language properly, let alone another language! Returning asap!
POS 	ANYTHING TO WITH AMAZON SUCKS THEY RIPPED ME OFF AND SCREWED UP MY CHRISMAS
POS 	I put two of these up and both fell down within a few days. I put them up with the command tape it comes with, them it sit for 24 hours without any weight as per the instructions and both fell down before the week was out. thankfully my my cameras didn’t break but it did crack the shell. these are a great idea in theory but they need a better way to mount them to the wall. command tape just isn’t enough. really disappointed that I wasted $25 between the two sets I bought.
POS 	For hours I have tried to figure out this machine. It finally got the best of me. It is being returned. I can't figure out how to bind 8 1/2 x 11 size paper. It leaves a half punched hole either at the top or the bottom of the paper and the combs they give you are too long for this size paper as well.
POS 	These things are pretty useless. It'll tell you if it's in your home, but nothing more specific than that. Duh. I drove home. I know my keys are here somewhere. It'll let you sound a chime on the device, but it's so quiet that it's hard to hear. If the keys are between the couch cushions, forget it.
POS 	Did nothing for me. Would return if I could
POS 	Crap stays needed them for the academy kept popping loose during exercise
POS 	Does not work for skin tags!
POS 	Do not waste your money. I ordered on accident and after 5 minutes they wouldn’t let me cancel the order. I figured whatever I’ll use It. 1 these aren’t kindling they are slivers of wood. 2 you have to use a ton of them to start the fire. 3 customer service is horrible. Save your time and money by buying from someone else.
POS 	The bottom of the item is bulging somewhat, so it wouldn't stand - it is wobbly.
POS 	This inverter shorted my car's fuse. My car's battery was dead. Do not recommend it.
POS 	Nothing like the picture
POS 	One of the reasons I bought this was because it was a “Amazon Choice” I’ll never make that mistake again. Shame on you Amazon for recommending a piece of junk. Basically you get a bucket with a hole cut in the bottom of it with what I’m guessing is suppose to be a spreader but I’m not sure because I never could get it to work. You have to drill your own holes to attempt to mount the spreader. You have to have tinny hands and fingers to get them in place. Something that I surly don’t have. It’s poorly designed, poorly manufactured and just doesn’t work.
POS 	earring kept opening up, would not stay on my ears
POS 	Did absolutely nothing but made my couch sticky.
POS 	Wrong sink, wrong color, and not in condition listed.
POS 	Not worth getting. Doesn't stick on
POS 	Does not work and seller did not contact me back, very disatisfied
POS 	Socks do not fit correctly. Slide up to easily. Do not buy!
POS 	This was a birthday gift for my granddaughter. I ordered it and hoped it would get delivered in Germany (military APO). It did, she opened it on her birthday and loved her first real baby, but the arms and legs were very cumbersome. 4 days of being a Mommy and her baby lost a leg! My daughter can put it back on, but it fall right back off. When I went to return it, my time was expired. Don’t buy this baby, it will break a child’s heart.
POS 	I didn’t like this screen protector. Too many bubbles. And still left finger prints.
POS 	Looks sturdy, but it arrived completely destroyed.... legs were bended, unstable. unusable product
POS 	I haven’t even worn my new coat for a month and the zipper has already broke. Terribly disappointed given this was a Columbia coat. I would expect a full refund or a new coat to be sent.
POS 	It is just a rechargeable LED lantern, does not work at all as a bug zapper...
POS 	Worked great for a couple months, then couldn't hold a charge for more than a few seconds.
POS 	The size isn't what they described, I contact the seller, they said they will send the correct one and never happened. I'm very disappointed and never will by from this seller again.
POS 	Very bad product and doesn’t stick properly....fall down almost all of them Don’t waste your money
POS 	Pros: Installation isn't that bad if you can clearly follow basic instructions, looks great, touch input is great. Cons: Started peeling up within a week, fingerprint sensor doesn't work as advertised. Emailed customer service, and they marked my ticket as "resolved" even though they didn't even reach out to me Would not buy again.
POS 	They were fake and plastic I was very disappointed
POS 	My sister has amazingly white teeth and says it's because she uses this. Did nothing for me, so I have it to her.
POS 	This product didn’t work. Very disappointed for $12
POS 	Absolutely no adhesive backing
POS 	The Length was good but width wasn’t now my son is skinny and I couldn’t even zip up the zipper more than half way I’m disappointed in the size especially when your size chart says it should fit and I paid $30 dollars for it.
POS 	Didn't receive product yet...
POS 	This is my second one. My first one kept getting hot and wouldn't charge up my phone. Returned it and now my second one is barely charging my phone
POS 	I ordered a 2 pack and only received one pack!
POS 	I have yet to receive my package although Amazon shows it was delivered
POS 	wasn't as advertised
POS 	Just received oils. Bottle broken and contents all over.
POS 	'Solid glitters on the back won't fall off'... Want to bet? I'm covered in black and iridescent glitter is now covering my face and is all over my car.
POS 	Sadly I never received it. Daughter really wanted it for Christmas. I've reordered it.
POS 	1. This flashlight is closer to 400 lumens. This manufacturer is taking advantage of the fact that the average person does not have a lux light meter to measure the actual flashlight lumen output and is overstating their product's light output. 2. I found it annoying that you have to cycle through all three settings to turn the flashlight off.
POS 	Second tire worked out fine, however I was very disappointed when the first one had a pin sized hole at the bottom of the seal.
POS 	Not so lucky this time. Purchased a set for my sister who loved them and her box is not working at all . How embarrassing.
POS 	These caps do not work without a washer. Seller should know this and washer should be included like everyone else does. And seller states in questions that the washer is included.
POS 	Received this on 10/17 and used it 4 times. Just 10 days after purchase it won’t turn on. No return policy. Don’t be fooled by the 4 and half star rating. After carefully reviewing the 1star reviews, this seems to be a common issue with this massager. Wish I had paid more attention to the 1 star posts.
POS 	Cord were not strong enough. Students pull them apart within a month
POS 	A bit disappointed in this product I purchased for my kids for Christmas. The magnetic chalkboard wasn’t very magnetic, particularly down the middle of the board. I haven’t used it as an actual chalkboard yet so I don’t know how well that will work. But nonetheless this didn’t impress me. Of course the one thing they do provide you with is magnetic letters and numbers, none of which are duplicate so you really can’t spell anything! For the cost of this.... I expected better quality and a bonus or two but I am left disappointed.
POS 	water gathered in the hole and left spots on table. Silly to have a hole for a coaster.
POS 	First, the info in this book is more about how to study, where to study, facts about study habits, etc. There is not nearly as much substance on the actual exam. In addition, there are typos, and the writing is in English - reflecting that English is not likely the first language of the writer, which is fine, but that's what editors are for! Also, there is no PDF as promised in the description, although I have noticed now that they have changed the description, so I'm guessing there were other complains. I should have paid more attention to the other reviews.
POS 	There is no US BATTERY FOR THESE !!!! Waste Ugh !!!
POS 	It has too many flaws in the image
POS 	I bought this case because I really liked the black, white and yellow design. However, the design is scratching off easily across the case and revealing a plain white case underneath. I haven't abused the case, so while it's functional, I'm disappointed at how scruffy it now looks.
POS 	The buttons stick. Doesn't work much of the time. "Made in China" sticker on it. Throw it out and buy original.
POS 	Didn't even last a few weeks before breaking. Terrible. Do not buy.
POS 	Does not light up and the fuse is too small to replace.
POS 	The buckle is right on the bone on the outside of my wrist making it very uncomfortable. I cannot use this product.
POS 	very, very dim light. will be returning
POS 	The fabric is really cheap, and the dress doesn’t stay up right. The bra cups that are sewn in are also small and sit wire in the dress. It caused a line across my chest that just wasn’t attractive.
POS 	love the keyboard itself, but this product is advertised as an RGB keyboard.... The one I received is the classic green only lighting. very dissapointed :(
POS 	This product never worked right from the beginning. One of the sensors doesn’t work. The other sensor has been through four sets of batteries in a month. The manufacturer does not include information to contact them about this crappy alarm. Keep shopping, and don’t buy this one.
POS 	Charged for item but never received it.
POS 	I followed the instructions and tried to change my code for the lock. However, the bottom piece will not turn back into locking position making this useless.
POS 	I was told a replacement would be sent or I would receive a refind and that was over 8 months ago. I cannot seem to get any help from this company so please don’t order if you love your pet! The smell of the car seat was completely toxic, I aired it out before use, over a day, as I had read this from other buyers. The smell did not go away, I tried to use it but the toxic fumes from the seat made my dog begin to vomit after sitting in it for about 30 minutes. I should have known when he began sniffing it when placed inside and then kept sniffling while inside and kept trying to get out of the seat and away from the smell. Do not purchase if you are concerned for your dogs safety. Unless you want to go to the vet when your dog begins vomiting from the fumes, then I do not recommend this as a purchase. Also, the quality of the car seat was terrible, the price did not match up with the quality. The worst purchase I have made In the 6 years I have been with Amazon.
POS 	I've had my printer for years, and I use dozens of the same type of cartridge per year. This time I ordered at 2-pack of HP 62 black ink. Strangely, the first cartridge is fine, but the second one cannot be accepted by the printer. I've tried other cartridges to ensure that it is only this one that is faulty. Every time I try to install, printer tells me to "remove and replace to insure proper installation." Again, it's not my printer. It's just the ONE cartridge. Bummer. Ink isn't cheap. Furthermore, the return window closed (it's been exactly a month), and of course I couldn't have known that the 2nd cartridge wouldn't work until now. I feel Amazon should replace with a working cartridge under these circumstances, but apparently it's too late. Crummy.
POS 	The laptop is fantastic... for the first year and a half. The components are great, good graphics, good memory, good battery; an all around good laptop for work and light gaming. The problem is the case. The case is a piece of crap. It’s made of a brittle plastic, and all of the screw mounts in the screen joints begin to rip out of the plastic simply by the wear and tear of opening and closing the laptop. The screen is only mounted to the mainframe on the right side; the left side is simply screwed into the plastic. I bought the laptop in June of 2017, and right around the corner of New Years 2019 the remaining screws all came loose. This had been building for the last few months as more screws kept coming loose and this caused a strain on the body, bending the fan case and causing the fan to make loud buzzing noises as it scraped against the curvature of the bending. This was entirely caused by opening and closing the laptop over the course of a mere 18 months. I hope I can get a refund. The computer still functions but it had begun overheating as the fan wasn’t working properly. I know this laptop has tons of good ratings, and I bought it because of that, but I would stay away from this model if you want a laptop that will last you two years or more.
POS 	This is my first order ever from Amazon that had problems. Took the hitch to my local repair and install shop looking for a quick quality install. Left Van at shop so that they could fit it in to work on. Got a call later that day with the sad report that the hitch would not fit. Problem was that the hitch was about one inch to narrow and the bolt holes did not align no matter now they tried to juggle it. Made sure this hitch it was a perfect fit by checking several vendors before ordering, so it was so disappointing when it did not. Also depressing was I had to pay $ 25.00 to return an item that was useless, not including the time wasted to resolve the issue. Contacted CURT, awaiting their customer support Dept. Will update this review after hearing from them
POS 	Was never delivered. I asked for a replacement and that was never delivered. Instead I got a notice that they processed a refund. I just wanted the dang toy.
POS 	In about a year’s time, 3 of the 5 have blown out, each one after only a few months with only moderate use. I expect the 4th and 5th ones to follow suit as they’ve only recently started use. Will be contacting the seller for refund or replacement under warranty for the 3 of them that have already blown out. Will update the review when I know more.
POS 	The case is good quality but when the case is on the phone the power button stays pushed down. I would not recommend this case. I sent it back for a full refund.
POS 	I didn’t not even wear it regularly for a month and the right pocket zipper fell of,I don’t even remember using the zipper to close the pocket
POS 	This does not come close to fitting my truck. the shape is completely stupid. Thank goodness it was so cheap.
POS 	returned. NOT weatherproof by any means
POS 	No young child’s Mom looks like this today. I ordered it just in case a different size family didn’t work with the dollhouse my granddaughter received for her third birthday.
POS 	Good color, nice quality, and too small.
POS 	Absolutely junk. Screw holes don't match, so you take an hour to try and adjust it, to have it fail.
POS 	screw stripped within the first use and nearly lost my Iwatch
POS 	Don’t know if this is a good product. Since it was packaged with car wash liquid that destroyed the packaging and it was falling out of the box like sand
POS 	Read the reviews before ordering, but there were 2 pages and I only read page 1. Page 2 reviewer said it did not fit a 2019 Prius. Boy was he right! Some pieces are the wrong size for the 2019 model and one little compartment is missing all together. I'm returning!
POS 	This is cheap. Doesn't come with the frame and I thought it was all the colors... nope just one. I'll be surprised if it last a week.
POS 	This item was not in my shipment that was delivered
POS 	never received this. trying to figure out how to not be charged for it.
POS 	After just 3 months of owning these four cables only 1 (the 1ft foot length) isn’t broken. I’d recommend trying another brand!
POS 	The cleat was too long. Even when forced ... off the bike.. I was unable to snap it into place. Maybe I just got one that was bad? They do fit on my specialized shoe with no problem I have ordered a new set and will follow-up
POS 	The surge stopped functioning a little more then a year after I bought it. Will not sync with phone, etc. I don’t recommend for the price.
POS 	Junk! Not supported by any iPhone. Dont waste your time and money.
POS 	I never received my thermometer probe. So I can’t review.
POS 	To flimsy. Don't care about rolling into small carry bag. Not what I want out of day pack, but might be right product for others.
POS 	It won’t work after a week
POS 	I have tried a variety of different sweeteners and this is probably the worst tasting I've tried.
POS 	It could be an OK product: looks good from a short distance, just do not show the "flower" part of the apple: very fake looking, like they forgot to finish it. Very light, may be too light to be realistic. Price would be good if product was usable.... but it is not. It came in a plastic bag with no any kind of cushioning and packaging material! Plastic bag, not cardboard box! It took long time for shipment from Thailand.... came with dents in almost every apple! Why would anybody ship fraudulent items in a plastic bag??? Apparently, looking at the reviews, I am not the only one who had this issue. Yes, I dd see the reviews before I order, but I assumed "lesson learned".... apparently not. I requested a refund, and first was offered a label where I had to pay for shipment back to Thailand. I called Amazon and they got involved. Than I got offer from the seller: He will refund $4 and I do not have to ship it back.... I reply that I expect full refund and can ship it back at seller's expense or I can dispose the items. Last message I got was that I will get full refund ( in a few days, so still waiting), and no mentioning what to do with the apples. I have to mention: the whole communication with the seller was very polite.
POS 	Never arrived and this was a gift I'm really upset
POS 	Unable to get clean. Used several prescribed cleaning methods.
POS 	What showed up is not what we ordered. I ordered a bit holder and got mustache wax? Then it says I can not ask for a return. So am I just stuck with something I didn't order?
POS 	This set of staples doesn't work in the mini stapler that I bought on Amazon.....Jams every time!
POS 	Bought this for a 2017 Ford F-350. Terrible product. Followed instructions exactly. Vent shades do not sit correctly so that when you put your window up it keeps going back down. Returned them and the company Auto Truck Toys only refunded 50% for a restocking fee. Product doesnt work but you have to pay for the terrible design. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR FROM THIS COMPANY. You would be just giving away your money. I give this product and company NO STARS. I had give it a star otherwise it wouldn't allow me to submit
POS 	Not a fast charger as compared to similar products in market. Connect and disconnect continuously because of week thread at phone’s end.
POS 	I don't have anything like this need more information please.
POS 	I am very angry that the book left me hanging . I will NOT buy the next book, or any other by this author. I give it 0 stars.
POS 	Attachment to vent isn't as secure as others I have used. Largely this is due to how I far it sticks out away from the vent. Also, the wireless charging isn't as fast as the other quick charger I use. My phone with a very slim case, still drains while using navigation and taking a call over Bluetooth when it's on the charger. I don't have the issue when it's plugged in rather than on this dock.
POS 	This set did not match my other rugs!!
POS 	Terrible product. I never write reviews but I have to write this one. The protectors are too flexible, so there’s always a little overhang. And if you bump the overhang at all, it peels right off. The adhesive is this weird spray that runs all over your watch face and yet somehow fails to adequately adhere to the edges of the protectors. I don’t recommend this product, it’s incredibly difficult and frustrating to install and doesn’t even work once it’s done.
POS 	This product is only 2.99 per box at any store. This price is more than twice as high. I wont be buying this product from Amazon anymore. So much for free shipping. I could have bought 4 boxes for what you charged me for 2 boxes
POS 	What a waste ...they are not stickers
POS 	Came so dead there wasn't any saving it.
POS 	This has no effect on mosquitoes in central CA
POS 	Unhappy. Extremely uncomfortable. Don't be fooled. Not happy. Unqualified. It's terreible when a software does not exactly what it says it does.
POS 	Updated: Threads were came out even though it is just the first day I put them on (& stayed in-doors at home during the whole day)!!! Poor quality!! First image: Do feel the compression. Let's see if it does work for relaxation.
POS 	The batteries were not all working. One can’t be charged at all. Am just going to throw it away
POS 	Box was delivered to door in the Instapot box So wife opened door and figured out one of her gifts.. That was a real Bummer :(
POS 	Even after warranty support (during which they sent me a whole new set of lights) some lights still flicker out when playing. Not worth the money.
POS 	Paper thin pillow. Returning immediately.
POS 	Did not fit my 2014 Maserati Ghibli
POS 	Cheap material. Poor craftsmanship in the embroidery details.
POS 	I searched for edible and got cardboard.
POS 	Never received this item. E-mailed numerous times. No reply
POS 	this was a waist of money
POS 	I bought this clock a little over a month ago and it's already not working. For the past few days, the hands have been randomly stopping, but they would start up again when I picked it up off the wall, as if they were just getting jammed. I thought it may have been the battery so I replaced it but it didn't make a difference. Also, it may not tick, but it does make this sort of weird scratching sound, which is very easy to hear when there's no other sound. I honestly wish it would've broken earlier so I could have returned it, but I am now two days past the return window. I am not normally one to leave bad reviews, but I'm pretty annoyed that I spent almost $30 on something that broke after only a month and I can't return it.
POS 	Was really looking forward to this but it keeps coming up with an Error msg. I've checked back a number of times throughout the day...same thing!
POS 	Rhinestone part fell off of ribbon after one wear.
POS 	I ordered the smallest size but it was too big on me. I am 5 ft 115 120 pounds. The dress was just too big and too long. On someone much taller I'm sure it would look good.
POS 	Does. Not stick to keys... falls off! Not useable
POS 	Pretty disppointed by this beer chiller. I gave it to my husband for Father’s Day - he was super pumped to use it. The first bottle we put it into was too small for it and so you couldn’t drink out of it and this it didn’t serve it’s purpose.
POS 	This case breaks really easily, and i way overpriced
POS 	So far not working. I keep getting a driver error
POS 	Terrible, don’t waste your money. Runs small and I have small hands.
POS 	Ordered a xxl fits like a medium.
POS 	Ordered 2, one didn't work or charge. The other charged but the light never turned green showing it was charged. Hard to believe this is 3200 lumens. Not happy with purchase.
POS 	The first time I dropped the phone the the screen popped off and shattered.
POS 	Interesting info but the book is poorly made. The binding cracked the first time I opened the book.
POS 	I did not receive this item even though Amazon claims it was delivered.
POS 	Opened the case and pulled the rubber ear piece off to change it out, slipped the new rubber piece on and it just disintegrated. Even better, one of the wires on the inside is disconnected, so can't even put it back together!
POS 	Have tried several time with poor results each time. Does nothing to clean the microwave.
POS 	$24 dlls for a tiny piece of s.... ! Just check it vs a composition book.. Dont spend your money it does worth it !
POS 	Nice long durrable cord. Straight forward install on my Vulcan 1500 classic. Stopped working after a couple months which makes it useless.
POS 	This game will not install and the activation code is wrong. I will never again download games from Amazon
POS 	bad wouldnt play all the way thru cleaned the dvd and my dvd player rip off
POS 	Installed this on my pull and 35 days later all it will do is read high salt and flash warning lights. Had water tested and salt is fine. This was a waste of money
POS 	There's no spray nozzles,don't like the fragrances most of them smell like mens cologne
POS 	after 1 month its shaking like bloody mary.
POS 	Did not receive item
POS 	This came folded in half inside the envelope. Only half of it sticks to the fridge.
POS 	The gauge was very inaccurate
POS 	SO DID I GET CHARGED?
POS 	Bought this product to scare the pigeons from my roof but it didn't do anything. Pigeons are still there and the head of the owl doesnt really spin. Would not recommend this product to anyone.
POS 	I bought this item for its portability during my trip to Iceland, but the one time I plugged it in (using a universal adaptor) and turned it on, it suddenly smelled like something was burning and made a pop sounds, then stopped working. What a waste of real estate in my already limited suitcase space. Didn't even get to use it once. Dangerous and worthless for my purposes.
POS 	I got a rock with 3 leaves on it. Waste of money.
POS 	Is nice but it's outside and many rusty
POS 	I don't recommend these. Mine arrived and one of the lashes is missing the outer magnet so they won't lay right or even stay on. Since this only contains one full pair, I can't use them.
POS 	The way they were designed on the front they cause rocks to Bounce off you’re rocker panel chipping paint like crazy
POS 	It was found in the BEADS section. It is thin string, supposed to act as a curtain. They were a twisted mess, couldn't untangle! I returned them.
POS 	the set is cute for Christmas but do not use for 'dinner' the plates are extremely flimsy. did not use them for dinner as they would not hold up. Okay for pie
POS 	I opened the box to see that all sponges looked dirty, like they had been run over by a truck dirty! Not only that, the order was supposed to be 8, I received 6. Ironically, there was a sticker on the box stating it was inspected by Amazon, so that makes me think someone needs a new job. Yikes. I can't return them, but Amazon did say they will gladly refund my money. You're really taking a risk by purchasing these!
POS 	I got a broken ball as well as there was a bug in the bag with the tongue rings. Not only gross but not OK when I paid the price I did and I have to clean them.
POS 	These were counterfeit. I had previously ordered the Kitchables espresso cups. Those came in distinct packaging and had their logo stamped on the bottom of each cup. This order of 8 oz coffee cups were not made by Kitchables although they were marketed as such. They had a different stamp on the bottom of each cup, and they came in nondescript packaging. Also, there were scratches and bubbles in the glasses.
POS 	Firstly, I do like the backdrop. But in the product overview, it says that there are 3 velcro mounting loops: One at the top (i.e. portrait) and two along one side (i.e. landscape). I only have the one at the top. Also, the muslin has started to wrinkle, but I guess (hope) this can be steamed out?
POS 	Don't know what happened to this order? Never did hatch?
POS 	These pale in comparison to the real thing. Don't be fooled! they are weaker, less tasty, and generally underwhelming in taste, consistency, froth, and aroma. Not worth the effort.
POS 	Bought this in September, died in November. Don’t ya think it should have lasted longer. I will not purchase this brand again. The return date for this item ended in October so I have a paperweight.
POS 	Too bulky and makes a thin laptop a lot heavier
POS 	Used this very lightly until my daughter was several months old. Cover became ridiculously brittle and had numerous splits (with sharp edges!) by the time she was 15 months old, which makes it uncomfortable, not water proof, and prone to bacterial growth. I expected much better from this brand.
POS 	It says on the Amazon site this shipped August 21st. I still have not gotten it yet.
POS 	We received a set of 3 owl necklaces and 3 bracelets instead of this set of rings. Husband opened it and daughter was playing with it before I came home. Hope the company will send me the correct product.
POS 	Wanted as screen protector, it popped off at some point. Have no idea where or when I lost it
POS 	Thin, paltry and a huge let down. Should have cost about $15.
POS 	This charger no longer is working. Tried it on multiple outlets w multiple different plugs. No dice, it doesn't show any power at all. it is less than 2 months old.
POS 	I loved the smell, but the liquid it in weirdly crystallized and solidified and made the product unusable, which is really disappointing when you pay this much for deodorant.
POS 	Used it for 2 days and now can't even feel it in your back. Waste of money
POS 	Battery blew up in remote stick. It no work
POS 	I received some spray !! I’m not sure if I should use it ! It’s a diff color ,,
POS 	The product came in and the spoons are already cracked and broken.
POS 	i don’t know why ppl gave this high reviews. This stuff so sux. Didn’t work Waste money .
POS 	This is a complete waste of money. This item is not worth more than $1. It is very tiny. I somewhat expected the size as far as length and height, but this is super thin as well. There’s no way to hang it on the wall and it’s so thin, it will not stand on its own. Also, for the price, I expected it to be at least hand painted. The lettering looks screen printed and very cheap! What a disappointment! What a rip off!!!
POS 	Dog clipper battery died after using 2X. Would not charge anymore. Bad product. Want my money back.
POS 	It loses calibration after a couple times of opening & closing the blinds. I’ve had it for about 2 weeks & have been recalibrating all 3 of them every other day. It’s nice to have them on schedule mode but they’re always uneven & it’s annoying to calibrate again & again.
POS 	This shirt didn't fit well at all. It was saggy all through the torso as the elastic was seen only at the bottom and not in the waist. The logo was off center and all at the bottom which continued the awkward look.
POS 	I purchased this even though I knew it was a 3rd party product - I’ve had success in the past fixing iPads and iPhones. This said, Apple’s more recent iOS versions recognize non Apple hardware and prevents proper functioning of the phone. It is possible to restore to a previous iOS backup (if you have one saved) but I don’t want to have a phone with an outdated iOS. Much like others, I felt the tools included were sub standard, but everything else seemed like quality.
POS 	Terrible these came on a bag smushed. Extremely bent an uncomfortable. Very very cheaply made.cant give 0 stars so they're lucky they got one.
POS 	These are not the hats we ordered. There is no where that I can return the shower hose and get the hats. Pleas advise
POS 	Product was not what was advertised, the black/pink one I order is supposed to have a grey fuzzy type fabric on the inside and instead it has a the black non fuzzy inside that is shown in one of the other jackets. Super disappointed with this fact as the reason I bought it was bc it had a warmer type of insulation.
POS 	I bought two of these calendars - I had one sent to my daughter and bought one for myself. If my daughter lived closer I would pick it up from her and return both of the calendars. The quality is something you'd expect from the 99 cent store. The pictures are fine but the quality of the calendar itself is not what I expected.
POS 	I returned this item and they said they didn't get the return. They now won't give me my credit.
POS 	Never received my outfit. Very Disappointed
POS 	No notification of the shipping, ever came!
POS 	Never could get the dogs to use it. and they would end up tearing up the puppy pad anyways even if they cant get the edges.
POS 	cool colors and design but it broke right away because it was made with cheap materials. disappointed
POS 	Do not buy this table. Mine arrived with lots of small cracks and chips that were only obvious once I built it. In addition, when it rains, a thick sheen of water accumulates on the surface. It's enough to soak a big towel. A request to resolve the matter went unanswered. After Amazon intervened, they asked to have it shipped back, but that would cost as much as what I paid for the table because it is heavy. I would stay away from making purchases from this vendor altogether. They have shown no interest in resolving this.
POS 	has a disgusting plastic taste when you fill it up. worst product eve, really mad I cant ge a refund... Even after multiples cleaning, it's even worst
POS 	Bought this months ago set up app, downloaded it and still won’t link to camera. Haven’t been able to use.
POS 	These wipes smell very medicinal and they gave our puppy a rash. She got red bumps with little spots of blood on her neck. Unfotunately we are returning these and do not recommend them.
POS 	It quite working a week after I got it so no I'm not happy with the company
POS 	Pictured tee shirt shows sleeves,as all t shirts have. The shirt that arrived did not have sleeves. It was a sleeveless t shirt. Deceptive advertising? Bad experience.
POS 	Not useful for gaming. Have it plugged into an excellent USB power station and tried a couple new cables to be sure. This unit just shuts off, almost like it's overheating or something. It went for an hour when first turned on, then ~20 minutes after that, then just a few minutes each time we get it restarted. Junk!
POS 	Doesn't work and I didn't get my money back. Do not but this
POS 	It was canceled by the store
POS 	Poor quality, strap broke and has only been in use for 2 months. Not worth the money. Zippers are poor quality. Would not purchase again.
POS 	Strap broke off as soon as I tried to put it on. Very cheap material.
POS 	Way smaller than pictured!
POS 	Looks much better in the picture than in reality, where it looks insubstantial and cheap!
POS 	First time purchase of this brand. I thought this was a high quality product so I got it as a treat to add some variety to a pellet diet. I only give a small portion daily and store it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh between feedings. The last couple of weeks I started noticing small moths in my house! Most of them are in the room where my parrot is fed. Some with brownish gray speckled wings, some are a cream color. Never had a problem before and local moths are much larger in size. Tossing out what’s left of this stuff and sticking to my Harrison’s pellets. No more seeds for us.
POS 	I ordered Clorox bleach and it wasn’t even that. It was two bottles of 409 steel and stone cleaner. Bogus.
POS 	Does this look like a sock to you? Uncomfortable on the toes, and it doesn’t even stay secure with the Velcro. Couldn’t pull it anywhere near tight enough to be effective.
POS 	This is supposed to be a quality product, it is not. The fabric get weak and splits in various places. I will not purchase again.
POS 	Do not buy. Seller will send expired product & will not respond to your inquiries. Amazon will not help. You will not receive a refund. You will get stuck with stale product.
POS 	I purchased this for a family vacation so it would be easier for my mom to shuffle cards (she has arthritis). It didn't even last through our first night of cards. I would not purchase again.
POS 	I have owned it one month and the side bar broke already. I am not rough on my phone, so pretty disappointed.
POS 	I've had this display port cable since January 2019, about six months into using it my screen kept turning black out of nowhere. So I had to keep plugging it into another display port on my GPU to get the screen to register. I continued to use it like this for another several months until it kept happening more frequently, now I just switched back to HDMI and have not had any issues for a week. This chord looks pretty but is defective.
POS 	Def not waterproof! My car seat got soaked while traveling.
POS 	Didn’t care for this. Not organic enough. Gave headache.
POS 	Customer service and communication is terrible.. Wouldn't do what was right... Won't be buying from them again.
POS 	Not sure why this product never came. I just got an email stating my money would be refunded and it was too late to order something else that looked like this. I was really bummed
POS 	I never leave reviews but I was So dissapointed I had to leave one. It was not at all the color online made it seem (it is almost white baby blue and the picture made it appear more of a bright easter-like blue/teal). It also came with a Hole down the side seem. Unfortunately I placed an order of two at the same time, and if the next one comes not as expected and riped too I will be even More disappointed. Such a let down.
POS 	These are terrible! I haven’t even had them for a whole month and they already have cracks in the tubing. They also Easily slip off of the connection port which is super annoying. Save your money and buy another brand or just actual spectra tubing.
POS 	Very cheap material.
POS 	Disintegrated in washing machine. No one piece of what was left was too big to fit into a thimble. POS!
POS 	Product was received promptly but was not completely sealed. I was able to take out the nasal spray without cutting open the package. Since I can't 100% trust the product, I am throwing it in the trash. It was a great price, however.
POS 	They were very small wasnt as big as i thought they would be
POS 	It is CHEAP! It looks like an old toy charm. I was going to use it as a stocking stuff next winter's holiday, but would be too embarrassed to have it in there! Very poor quality and CHEAP looking.
POS 	I never received this item. Even tho it’s marked as delivered. Long wait for nothing.
POS 	My parrot destroyed this bell in 4 days , WASTE of money !
POS 	The product lights aren’t very bright. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Cheap junk that needs to be removed from Amazon.
POS 	Very thin material and short. Nothing like what’s pictured.
POS 	Not a good product at all. It is poorly designed, and does not have good structure. While it is supposed to carry a laptop, it does not work well for that because the bag cannot hold its own shape and is awkward. I don't recommend this product.
POS 	This is not the real product. Smells nothing like the other bottles I have purchased from stores. It sucks that it cant be sent back. I'd love to have my money back for this product.
POS 	I never received your product.
POS 	It did not meet my expectations. Unable to connect to internet and has no use with what I was looking for.
POS 	I am very disappointed in this product. I prepared an old cat scratched leather chair according to instructions but the product: 1.) Did not hold down the scratches without a ton of product on them. And 2.) Peeled off after drying when rubbed. There is no way this is going to be able to handle an entire chair. I just tried it on a couple of spots that had scratches and a few nice areas. My plan was to change the colar of a Terra-cotta colored chair to an off-white, Linen color. I do not believe this product can handle it. Also, my chair has a texture. I would want to match the real leather texture. This product should include a mold to press onto the damp product in order to do this. It does not. There are car seat kits that do include these molds. I will need to try a different product.
POS 	wasn't soft at all! Really hard
POS 	Not glass. Plastic. More like play cups for kids. Would send them back if it didnt come from so far
POS 	Didn’t even send them back, threw them out! Had a horrible smell even after I washed and used fabric softener, I thought something happened to my dryer because the smell was so horrible!
POS 	Didnt even let me play it lmao
POS 	Bad. Just bad. The fabric is scratchy and the seams are uncomfortable. And, the inner ball was the incorrect size. A waste of time! Sent it back the same day I received. It's too bad because it's a great idea, just a poor design and poor quality control.
POS 	Sticky glue around the neck of the bottle. Not sure if this is safe to contain food.
POS 	Upon receiving this card game and realizing its playing instruction flaws, I contacted the vendor for clarification. 2 months have gone by without a response. Not even a response that said thank you for your inquiry, we'll get back with corrected instructions, or one that explains that vagueness and errors were intentional (which is nuts, to use a phrase inherent in the game), etc. I also want to point out a racist fact: there are playing cards that are black (bad - attack action) and white (good - defend against attack action)...I just cannot believe it. So, returning this game which just plain disappoints all the way around the card playing table.
POS 	It only gives you an option for one local news stations not all of them
POS 	Too small for my foot. Kept sliding off.
POS 	These headphones did not work and I had to return them. I ended up buying a different brand.
POS 	This bulb blew out as soon as I screwed it in. I had to go to the second one and that one is ok so far (fingers crossed). If it were a one pack I would have been in trouble. I didn’t intend on paying for two, but only getting the use out of one. What’s the point? Please help!
POS 	Did not order this, a relative did
POS 	Really cheap quality, come with a rip on the side
POS 	Terrible.. it doesnt do anythig
POS 	These magnets are not strong enough for my needs. Would be fine for very light weight items attaching to something like a refrigerator.
POS 	Thanksgiving fail. The box should have come with 4 teaspoons and 4 tablespoons. Instead, the box had 8 tablespoons. So aggravating when hosting company.
POS 	Product came broken and when I asked for a replacement I never received it but did get a refund.
POS 	It is very slow charging. Every time I plug it into my phone I get a warning. Also when I plugged it into my computer said not compatible. Must really be a piece of junk
POS 	The e shine gel cracks and peels off like tape.
POS 	Two shipments in a row..... the contents are destroyed :(
POS 	Tried every seed and only three produced springs. Very disappointed.
POS 	The socks while feeling comfortable when wearing, left the deepest and longest lasting mark on my legs of any socks I have ever worn. I am a woman who wears a narrow size 11 shoe. I buy men's socks because they're easy to find rather than a specialty size woman's sock. I am surprised they are men's socks and not boys. They did wash up well and are soft. I think they are a good deal as well. Too bad they left such an alarmingly deep mark. I gave them to the Salvation Army.
POS 	This product is a joke. Someone sewed two pieces of the soft strip of the velcro on the ends instead of a scratchy strip, hence it won't attach so the headband can be worn. Going back & not reordering. Someone was sleeping on the job because quality control sucks!
POS 	I purchased 48 cups of Quaker Real Medleys ON PRIME DAY, 36 of the cups expire in 1 month!!! 1st of all I do not eat hot cereal every day, even if i did selling a "non perishable" product with only 30 days of shelf life IS A VERY POOR PRACTICE!!!! Especially without making it clear to the buyer SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!!!!
POS 	Quit working after the first use.
POS 	The description says 4 pop charges I received my item today and only got two
POS 	Didn’t work effectively, returned
POS 	This thing is pathetic. I bought it to scrub the bath tub because I am so tired of bending down for that back breaking job. So I charged it up and was eager to try it out...but then all of my hopes went down the drain when the smallest brush wouldn't even turn after applying the slightest pressure to it! Seriously Clorox? Who designed this piece of crap anyway? Definitely returning this one. The last thing I need is another worthless gadget.
POS 	If I could give this a zero star I would. I wouldn’t know how easy it is to assemble, or how beautiful it looks in my home because it came with NO BOLT KIT! I now have pieces of a table and chairs, with no way to put them together. The box arrived 3 days later than promised, and was beat to hell when it did arrive. I would love to have somewhere to sit and eat my meals, but I will once again be waiting.
POS 	Purchase this from my three-year-old granddaughter who wanted a tea set. Within the 1st few days the to cheer piece broke apart and it just wasn't made that well.
POS 	This product wasn't too difficult to put on my phone, but it didn't last a week before it was coming off. Will not buy again.
POS 	Update: I will NEVER BUY A CUISINART PRODUCT AGAIN, ever. Was on phone with customer service for an hour having to literally ARGUE with an agent -- who refused for a long time to transfer me to a supervisor -- and then with a supervisor. After all that, no resolution. All they offered to do was pick up the machine and send it for repairs...but we'd have to stay home, waiting for pick-up, for a 2-3 day period -- which could not even be scheduled for a particular week. (We're leaving for vacation in a couple of days.) Or -- get this! -- they'd email us a shipping label so we could take the machine to UPS at our convenience, but it would take them 2-3 DAYS TO SEND THE EMAIL. An email! After that it would be about a month before we got the machine back. Utter absurdity. **** Like many other reviewers here, I've bought this machine twice -- the first one was good for a couple of years (not as long as I'd expect from this brand), then started pouring water out the bottom instead of through the coffee basket, so I figured I'd just gotten a bit of a dud or the problem was somehow my fault, and I bought a new one. The new one is truly awful -- sounds like a combine harvester, and now, after just 5 months, it makes nothing but sludge with black crema and a half-inch of grounds on the bottom of a weak, bad-tasting cup of coffee. I've cleaned and re-settled all the external parts every way I can think of, to no avail. I'd expect better of a machine that cost half of much. Cuisinart used to make top-quality products....
POS 	Terrible! Purchased twice and both times had to replace within weeks. Only used one time a week to update family calendar. Should not have gone “dry” so fast!
POS 	Unfortunately, they don't give the option of zero stars. If I called it a piece of junk, it would be a compliment. The assembly instructions are largely inadequate. The wheels don't go in their sockets. The screw in the guard assembly is too short to attach the bracket and, worst of all, the head will not stay up. It falls forward and there is no way to tighten it and make it hold its position that I can see. Stupidly, I waited too long on open the box so I am past the allowable return date. My bad. I am stuck with it and have lost the money. Don't make my mistake. Find another one.
POS 	I didn't get to use this because I brought the wrong case didn't know there's a difference in S6 and S6 Active at the time of purchase
POS 	I ordered two shades of this lipstick. Both had an unpleasant chemical smell and taste. The texture was both tacky and chalky. Feathering and bleeding of color for days. Neither color is true to pictured on Amazon or on the bottom of the tube. All around gross lipstick. Miserable to use.
POS 	I ordered this item but it was never shipped to me.
POS 	I bought these cords a mere few months ago and all of them no longer work. The cords frayed or fell apart and they all stopped charging for no reason I could see. This product blows!
POS 	Broke when used first time.
POS 	My package was supposed to arrive on the 18th and is still lost. This might be out of the seller's control, but I just received an email from the seller asking for an Amazon review. Since I have no product to review, and they didn't seem to be aware of that, it's a 1 star from me.
POS 	Did not ship. Will not re-ship. Only option was refund through amazon.
POS 	Ordered this cause I just needed a computer for the kids to do homework on. Right out of the box virus, ran virus scans and all that crap still not a great computer. My bad the saying is true you get what you pay for.
POS 	Never got this particular towel. They sent the wrong one.
POS 	This cord is supposed to work for my projector and it doesn’t work at all!
POS 	Broke after 2 months of use.
POS 	I got this item damaged came wet and the dye came threw to all the pices unhappy
POS 	This lamp is not at all orange- despite what the picture shows, it shines bright white. It's not the shape pictured in the listing, as you can see. Also, there is no dimmer switch, or any switch at all, for that matter. All that came in the box was the lamp, a glass dish to set in the top, a leaky bottle of lavender oil, and a USB converter, so you can either plug it into a USB socket or a two pronged outlet. The wood base is nice, but has an over-sized piece of vinyl glued to it, so it doesn't "hide" under the wood. I turned it on for about three hours, and it didn’t get hot enough to make the oil drops I put in the cup disperse. Very disappointed. If you want a salt lamp, try one of the more expensive ones.
POS 	I have to laugh just to keep from cussing and crying, it says extra small I wasn’t expecting Barbie doll small. This is barley a mustache comb and definitely not a beard comb. It’s smaller than my thumb. Save your money and your time unless you collect dolls or something.
POS 	Terrible quality. They are not flexible like the originals of my Brooks running shoes. Laces are of a harsh material.
POS 	Had to return it several times for a close enough fit. A size XXX is actually a large adult size and medium fit around the arm/shoulder area. Finally gave up and got a full refund.
POS 	These were very hard and no favor. I tried them and after 2 bites I just threw the rest in the trash.
POS 	Horrible even to get open and then it’s so thick but says to put on a thin layer and I finally thought I got them looking good and put under my lamp and came out looking horrible with bubbles. Plus I thought it was a uv gel builder
POS 	This product is virtually unusable with a cell phone case. The application was fairly simple but as soon as I put the cell phone in it's case the the edges start to peels up/off. The adhesive is weak to say the least.
POS 	Is not the real product, packaged differently and it doesn’t work
POS 	I received the wrong product. I ordered Volumizing Shampoo and received for Oily hair Shampoo. I would like to get what I ordered but there is no way to contact this seller.
POS 	I bought eight batteries. I followed the instructions and installed them into my 5 solar garden lights at dusk so they could discharge overnight and recharge the next day. They worked well the first night and the next. Then two of them stopped working. In replacing them, I found a third one didn't work. Finally I got all five lights back on, but now they only stay on till about 1 or 2 am. Live and learn I guess.
POS 	Item arrived already used meaning it was matched to another key. Worthless and will need to replace with a new one
POS 	Wig looked horrible for what it costed
POS 	Not impressed, didn’t realize that the board is just a flat foam piece. The pegs barely stay in place. Very poor quality.
POS 	Product was inferior. They immediately fell off. Put on clean unpolished nails.
POS 	This does not work. I used a big potassium pill and it did nothing. I read another review said break in half so I tried that and it still did not work!
POS 	This backpack is lovely, but very poorly made. After only 3 weeks of use the top of one strap tore and then the bottom of that shoulder strap came apart completely!
POS 	Not to good of quality
POS 	not worth ordering. maybe better luck next time
POS 	Made with cheap, poorly-fitting material. Once I realized the assembly was about as good as it was going to get, I put it in my cabinet. As soon as I put a small box of sandwich bags on it, a chunk of paint flaked off to reveal a completely rusted shelf.
POS 	Product stopped working two days after the return window was closed. Now I’m stuck with a useless product. Very disappointed
POS 	This did not fit my truck. Very disappointed as Amazon said that it would.
POS 	I am using my filthy and falling apart 10+ year old computer chair over this because it's more comfortable and just works better. This chair feels cheap, the arm rests are very cheap with no adjustment and prone to bending outwards overtime. I'm going to give this chair away to someone who doesn't have one, and even then I feel bad that I'm giving them a sub-par chair.
POS 	The item arrived broken
POS 	If I can I wanna give 0 star. Too thick and hard and short with C curve? any way, we cannot use this kind of tips to clients. Threw away all the tips.
POS 	I tried very hard to read this book and kept pushing myself but about 1/3 through it I gave up. The story and especially Keller were just too weird. I don't like it when children are involved with horrible weird sick people and why there are authors who write about that stuff, I'll never know. A little bit may be okay, but this story was just too much to take.
POS 	Produce pieces did not match up. Asked for new product, they said they sent but it never left the warehouse. Asked for refund, they subtracted shipping which was substantial, had to make Amazon cover the shipping costs. Customer service for this company is only available in the middle of the night. Not worth the few dollars saving. Ordered off Josh and Main.
POS 	I did not receive order.
POS 	My husband thought these were really cute slippers and the price was right but sadly they were too small/narrow. With all of the lovely memory foam inside the slipper, we suggest an accommodation needs to be made for a comfortable out of the box experience for the wearer. Hubby considered ordering a bigger size but decided against it since he was in his standard size [he does not have a wide foot] and felt the problem would continue regardless of the size.
POS 	Not getting color what expected.
POS 	claims it has complete works. It does NOT. false advertising.
POS 	Straight out of the box these only worked intermittently, majority of the time they didn't work so unfortunately we are returning them
POS 	I have tried to like this oil, but to me it has a lingering smell of that which would be mucked out of a barn stall that a cow had occupied for 3 days. Even so, I tried for a couple of weeks to use it at night but it didn't do much for moisturizing my nasal membranes at night. Is there not some sort of nasal oil that could smell of lavender or vanilla instead of marinated stall muck?
POS 	McQueen didn't have eyes! I question whether this is actually made by Wilton.
POS 	Super bummed as I only received 52 of 100 stickers. I paid for 100 and when I asked for them to just resend it wouldn’t allow me to select that choice I just wanted the stickers.
POS 	In the picture it looks bigger than actually is. I could've gotten the same thing at Walmart, oh well live and learn it will last for a minute hopefully.
POS 	Product did not come with directions to put it together... Also did not come with the hardware to mount the tires. This product is cheap looking, and I would not recommend it to anyone!
POS 	After three days charging only two of six worked.
POS 	I did not order this product.
POS 	Sent the wrong item. I ordered the pink for my son and got the red which is water soluble. Very disappointed with this he is very upset.
POS 	This thing didn't even last on the phone. It wouldn't even install properly. I've put this type of screen protector on about 25-30 phones and thought I would give this one a try. Big mistake. Stay away
POS 	Not at all what I thought it was going to be.
POS 	This product was never received. My cousin had a stroke and needs the cane. He did not sign for it.
POS 	Crap! It zapped 3 flies and is now cooked. Dont work No more! Another junk product on here!
POS 	Poor material, cheap looking. Sent it back
POS 	Some bags came ripped
POS 	The "portion" that goes inside the wallet ripped in less than a month. Will order from different company next time and will pay more in hopes of better product.
POS 	One if them arrived damaged. Also the heating time is so long that it feels like forever. And if i use microwave to heat wax, bottle starts melting. Its just waste of money. I would never recommend this product to anyone.
POS 	Way smaller than it seems. Cheaply made. The plastic clips broke easy. The bookshelf looks very nice I’ll give it that. But unfortunately I can’t use it because the shelve clips were broken. Spend a little extra money and get a better one.
POS 	My son thought he was getting specific characters with an in-app purchase (he used $12 of his own birthday money). However, the characters it showed were ones that you MIGHT get. Guess it is random what you get. Needless to say, I had a very disappointed 10 year old. Hate the deception. Don't waste your money.
POS 	Could not get the seeds to grow.
POS 	These shirts were WAY too small (like size china) and when I tried to return them, Amazon is telling me they aren’t eligible for return.
POS 	Unable to rate headphones as the package arrived empty. Turns out the plastic bag envelope they used wasn’t sealed at the top. Got a refund and plan to try again but may just go to a store as amazon has been less reliable these days.
POS 	I've had the backpack for less than 2 months and already fell apart. The magnetic strap button fell off so I cannot secure the strap. It is rarely used. Very disappointed in cheap construction and lack of durability.
POS 	This screen cover is way too thick. I have to smash down on the screen to get it work at all, and even then it's frustratingly imprecise. I'm going to try a different brand ASAP.
POS 	every time i turned my computer on the program thrashed my drives for a half an hour and i couldn't stop it from doing it.
POS 	This did not provide a fog. It sprayed out like hornet wasp spray. Useless
POS 	Never received the book, when I contacted seller about my purchase I never heard back. Luckily amazon issued me a refund but still a disappointment.
POS 	These were too tight and the elastic was pinch and made the fabric buckle. I tried to wash a couple times to soften but I give up and will accept the loss because I won't wear these even if I run out of clean laundry.
POS 	Fit is absolutely unacceptable. It is so loose, the phone can fall out of it, despite the fact that it is supposedly designed for the ZTE Maven 3 that I put in it. Immediately started shopping for a replacement. Don't waste your money. I cannot fathom how people have given this thing 5 star ratings.
POS 	Cute to look at but my 3 year old son started wearing them and in one week they were leaning to one side and loosing the shape. So disappointed!
POS 	The slow feeder bowl I ordered never arrived. I reached out to the company, they stated it was lost by the shipping company and they would send a replacement. The replacement never arrived. I contacted the company again. They stated they were refunding me due to their continued issues. To date I have not recieved a refund yet.
POS 	Both pairs broke within 3 months of normal use.
POS 	I have been a nail tech for 23 years, this brush is not good I’m guessing the hair is made from something different???? Can I please return this item and get my money back please?
POS 	Package broken, nails everwhere. Waste of time and money. Won't order again!
POS 	This product is a fake. I have 300mbps internet speeds, once I used this, I was hard capped at 100mbps. I returned this and bought the old round style cat 7 and it worked perfectly. Do not buy flat or thin cables like this. ZERO stars. I had to choose 1 star to submit this review.
POS 	I usually love this oatmeal. Ever since being diagnosed with Celiac I have eaten this oatmeal almost every morning. Just recently purchased a case with the "new look" and "same great taste" and it doesn't taste at all the same. I use water and have to use much less with the new batch. It seems to have more sugar and less oats?? Very unfortunate as it is an easy and safe go to for someone without a lot of options.
POS 	Yeah, so I ordered the Ford F-150 series evolution puzzle for my wife's birthday. When I opened it, I realized the puzzle pieces were of a totally different puzzle. It's not even truck related, I'm not sure how you mess that up but this is not what we bought.
POS 	Once applied the fan stopped squealing and fine for a week. The squealing came slowly and is now back to a loud squeal. I guess it’s time to replace the fan.
POS 	The capsule got stuck in the spout.
POS 	It came almost completely smooshed together. Instead of useing a bubble package use a small box. This thing is useless now
POS 	I did not receive what I bought.
POS 	Never received my item but money was taken out of my account
POS 	Ordered 2 jars and on jar leaked during shipping. What a mess!!!
POS 	I purchased this item to use for my sons prom send off, the only balloons that were able to be used were the latex ones, no foil balloons could be used, also the discription shows a 2018, I was sent a 2019, which means the day of prom last minute I had to go and purchase the correct numbers which cost me an extra 40 dollars... I'm so disappointed..
POS 	No clear instructions, doesn't last more than 10 or 20 minutes. Buy cheap get cheap
POS 	I never received my order. I emailed several times, was told that it was damaged in transit and was asked whether I wanted a refund or a replacement. I requested a refund but have not received it. Instead, I have received several emails asking for pictures, for details about the damage, and have received no resolution.
POS 	I was excited to take this ball out to the field to throw around with my dog. Unfortunately, after 5 minutes she had already killed the squeaker. She likes the ball anyway and it's not worth returning, but the squeaker is completely dead.
POS 	Dislike cheap junk pan warped and eggs stick
POS 	If I could give this a zero, I would. So I ordered the basket. It arrived MUCH sooner than anticipated which was great. HOWEVER, they spelt my daughters name wrong on the bag. It was spelt correctly on the sticker tag, but not on the basket. I messaged them the day I received it and it has been 6 days with no response. I’m very irritated because Easter is this weekend and I now have no bag for my daughter.
POS 	I’ve had this keyboard for 5 months and it stopped working. The numlock button stopped functioning, meaning the entire board was locked and rendered useless. Just spend $20 more for a better one it will pay off long term.
POS 	I ORDERED IT BECAUSE ITS MY FAVORITE! BUT I RECEIVED A DIFFERENT AROMA.....STRESS RELIEF EUCALYPTUS SPEARMINT! OPENED BEFORE I NOTICED!
POS 	very uncomfortable... :(
POS 	Poor quality and don’t stick to brush
POS 	This product is a major disappointment! It didn’t even “peel” one egg! I followed directions to the “T”, it cracked the shells and that’s where it ended! It made more of a mess than anything. I would’ve returned it but I had thrown away the box it came in. If I can help one customer avoid purchasing this product it will make me feel better. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE BY BUYING IT!
POS 	This product sucked and it only last less than two weeks. I bought it for my classroom since the school do not supply. I missed the window to send it back. Very disappointed.
POS 	worked for 2 days then stopped. do not buy this item
POS 	Instead of the iPhone 6 wallet case I ordered, I received a completely different case for an LG phone. Obviously this phone case doesn’t even fit. When I tried to contact the seller, I received an email in broken that didn’t make any sense. Now I have the hassle of returning the case.
POS 	I used this book for my art class. I RETURNED THIS BOOK that I RENTED but being told that I didn't.
POS 	Way smaller than what I expect or what it shows in the picture.
POS 	I tried to use this for a good 15minutes. I still cannot figure it out. Not sure what it was designed for exactly. I have an iPhone X.
POS 	Product came damaged, unusable
POS 	I ordered this along with a 35LB bag dry dog food. The attached photos show what I am talking about.
POS 	After my 1st use, 1 glove fell apart
POS 	Not what was expected
POS 	didnt work after three weeks you get what you pay for
POS 	My dogs loved the canned food, but they won't touch the Dry. Even my rats aren't happy with this food. I'm disappointed.
POS 	Did not work for me Possibly not for my particular condition
POS 	Didn’t really care for it
POS 	Watch charger already quit working.
POS 	My foot slid around in this shoe. The elastic fabric is too flexible, too stretchy.
POS 	Unfortunately this steamer is worse than the one I just returned. I am very disappointed considering it had such a high star rating. It did not steam enough to take out the wrinkles in my shirt, it spit alot of water on the fabric and was kind of awkward to use. I suggest spending the extra money for a better quality brand.
POS 	I was immediately disappointed with the quality of this ring. It bent as I was removing the tag. It’s pretty and it hasn’t turned my finger green YET, but overall disappointing.
POS 	For the first tI'm ordering online Rockports I got a pair that was not satisfactory. Unfortunately I cannot wear this shoes because it is very uncomfortable.
POS 	Never received the item that I ordered. The last information I received was that it was only 30 miles from me a week ago. Amazon sent me an e-mail that it was lost and give it a week. It has been a week, so I asked for a replacement. Amazon said no deal. So I asked for a refund and again no deal. This is not the first time that I have not received an order from Amazon. It is time to start looking for mom and pop business again.
POS 	Never sprouted. We got one which died after a week.
POS 	when i got it, it didn't turn on
POS 	Lasted three months and buttons on screen stopped working. No support from suppliers.
POS 	I was to receive a pack of 6 instead I received only 1 so I spent $10 for 1 pack. What a ripoff
POS 	very small and didn't serve my purposes.
POS 	The "book" provides information that can all be found on on amazon's AWS website and by simply googling the information. There is literally no substance to this book. I would understand if it was $0.99 but for anything more than that it is a straight rip-off. You're honestly better off getting a For Dummies book.
POS 	I liked the feel of the tights. But they started pulling and stretched in the crotch after the first wear. These were for my 5 year old... Inferior product. Don’t waste your time on these.
POS 	These were advertised as 3 inch pots. They were barely 2.5 in pots. Not what I wanted.
POS 	This computer comes with a 5400 rpm HDD which is always at 100% making it very slow and makes some games unplayable, Dont buy unless you can upgrade
POS 	It fit loosely and didn't work at all.
POS 	Horrible. Crashed anytime my son tried to save. Also the previous owners profile names were still on and they were extremely offensive.
POS 	Amazon has the worst customer service I've experienced in a while
POS 	Bottle is good besides the fact that it’s very fragile. Cracked from the bottom of the bottle in less then a few uses. Very disappointed
POS 	The lights never came on.
POS 	Product didn’t work and cost 500% more then the purchasing price in order for me to return. Very disappointed.
POS 	I wish I could give less than one star. Twice I was purchased this product from this seller & twice it has crapped out shortly after the return window closed. I would say more but I'm down to less than 20% on my battery so I have to find my travel charger
POS 	Great initially but only lasted three months before failing to power on at all.
POS 	The sleep tracker has yet to work for me.
POS 	Caps broke almost immediately, unsure if hot water from the tap or cold air storing in the fridge but the plastic seems thermally sensitive. Don't buy.
POS 	Ordered this Prime product on Sun. Sept. 23 with a delivery date of Tues. Sept. 25. Got an updated email saying it would be a little late and to expect delivery by Thurs. the 27th. No order arrived on Thurs. so I emailed the company to see if they could help and they said, "NO...It's an Amazon product...contact their customer service." Amazon couldn't fill a replacement order by Friday night and I needed this bag for a Stadium event on Sat. the 29th. Absolutely no help from either party...package is still lost in the mail. Hopefully, I will get the refund I requested.
POS 	I sent this bag back. It was too small.
POS 	Sticky, color not as bright as shown in ads. Had to use a LOT of it to get even a transparent hint of color (if the light it it right), and even then it felt stiff and sticky - combing through it to soften was a major chore.
POS 	I ordered this product almost three weeks ago and still have not received it. It’s is now pass the projected delivery date and I have contacted the seller three times over a period of 2 weeks, with no response. Initially I was just requesting tracking information, but even after not receiving the package, no one cared to contact me. I didn’t have the highest of expectations for this product, but I expected to at least receive what I ordered.
POS 	Horrible computer. Very slow. Loaded with bloat-ware that you can't easily remove. This isn't a home computer. It is a cash generating commercial that you will regret purchasing. All I wanted was email and some photos and even that is problematic. If it sounds too cheap.....there is a reason..
POS 	The product arrived as schedule but upon unwrapping I noticed the letters were on the opposite side for placement making it impossible to apply to the wall. Therefore the art is useless
POS 	Ordered two cans with prime, never received them after 4 days. I got a refund and bought elswhere.
POS 	Poor adjustment options, unless you have a dog the exact shape it’s designed for. My dog is tall and lean, so it could not possibly fit right. I’ve seen it fit a couple different overweight dogs fine though (the dog shape that looks like a sausage from above). I cannot speak to how well it worked for me and my dog since it never fit properly.
POS 	WHEN AMAZON SHIPS FOR OTHERS , THE SELLER LOOKS BAD, AMAZON SHIPS FOR THEMSELVES , ALL ENDS WELL. HALF A BOTTLE IN THE BAG, HALF IN BOTTLE. I DO NOT THINK THE USUAL IS GOOD ENOUGH THIS TIME, A REFUND AND I REORDER.....THAT IS OLD AT THIS POINT. CANNOT EVAN GET 2 DAY SHIPPING RIGHT. THIS IS WAY PAST GETTING OLD. MY LAST TWO ORDERS HAVE BEEN LATE AND DAMAGED. WE PAY YOU WITHOUT DELAY , WE EXPECT THE SAME COURTESY. SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE TAKING ON MORE THEN YOU CAN HANDLE , AS A PROFESSIONAL COMPANY. 18 YEARS IN A MONETARY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE CAREER , I HAVE AT LEAST A IDEA OF HOW TO APPRECIATE CLIENTS.
POS 	Bristles falling out of a brand new brush... the brand label on the handle looked like a different font and all. Didn't feel like a Diane brush.
POS 	i used it for four days and it worked as promised. On the fith day i went swimming and at some point later on the fith day the controller popped out of the wrist band and is lost. I did not do any thing different on the fith day other than swim. Very poor design. I am now out 50 bucks. .
POS 	Not even 2 month and no longer working. Burning smell coming out of it. Definitely I don't recommend it. Waste of money.
POS 	Awful quality. Hood is small. Not satisfied.
POS 	They do not fit my glasses
POS 	This product is unstable and not sturdy.
POS 	This cartridge would not work in my printer. It kept giving an error message saying the cartridge was not properly installed. I removed it and replaced the empty cartridge and didn’t receive the same error. It would not let me print
POS 	Receive wrong item I buy blue and they send me black with red
POS 	Would definitely not recommend!!! Although the actual material that the bag is made of seems to be of good quality, the zippers are cheaply made. The zippers on my bag just won’t stay closed. It has split open numerous times, spilling all of its contents. Imagine the frustration having to pick everything up with 1 hand as you hold an infant with the other arm.
POS 	Dont waste your time. I ordered woody and they keep sending me Mater from Cars i sent it back and they still sent me the wrong thing again!!!
POS 	Boots less than 2 months old and falling apart.
POS 	Destroyed in the first wash
POS 	Package was delivered opened and with two bars missing
POS 	could not chew much too tough
POS 	I ordered these travel plugs for my trip to Italy. Luckily I took both the 2 and 3 prong plugs. One plug lasted for only one charge and then died. Good for me the other plug worked the rest of the trip. I would not recommend this product.
POS 	A product does not work. It did not generate any suction in will not stick to the light bulb.
POS 	False advertising!!! Tried it on 3 different 5v power banks did not work! Returning, soooo annoying!! I wish amazon would be better about monitoring these cheap falsely advertised products!!
POS 	You sent the wrong card.
POS 	Didn't work and stopped operating after just a few months. Waste of money.
POS 	Gate arrived with a very large noticeable chip on the corner of the front panel. There was also a pin missing from one of the hinges so it does not sit very sturdy at all. There are also some imperfections to the paint - it looks like they missed several holes with the sprayer and wood material shows through. Pics of all defects described above are attached. I ordered a replacement from the same company and will report back if the second one comes to us in better shape. Overall, with issues corrected, this gate will work for us because we have a small senior dog. I would not recommend for a younger, more agile dog prone to jumping, as it does not seem like a sturdy solution for retaining a more active pet. The gate is overall more aesthetically pleasing than most gates and will keep our little, calm guy from wandering where he shouldn’t. Update- replacement gate arrived with no chip but all other defects the same! These gates are cheap and poorly made! Buyer beware!
POS 	the quality is poor. It does what its intended to do but could be much better for $40. the edges are sharp and rough and the mesh part is rough. personally i wouldn't buy again as its way overpriced. Better options can be found or built from items at home depot.
POS 	Cute outfit worn for a day then seams & elastic were coming apart. Not a well made outfit
POS 	The cover is on upside down! I’m so disappointed!
POS 	Flimsy, no middle click, and small and uncomfortable for large hands.
POS 	Overall I was pretty displeased with this toy. I got it for my Police K9 so I expect toys to not last as long as they would for a normal drive dog. That being said I noticed problems before the dog even saw the ball. For one, they use a metal washer to keep the string tied onto the ball. Be sure to remove that first before you give it to your dog or run the risk that your dog cracks a tooth and undergoes a painful (and pricy) surgery to have that corrected. When I took out the washer I double and eventually triple knotted the knot at the bottom to keep it in the ball. The dog just has to pull a little and the string pulls right through the ball and you have no handle on your dog or the toy.
POS 	I had such high hopes because of other positive reviews but from my personal experience these suck. I have normal pillows, standard size nothing special and the zippers busted open with first use. I haven’t even washed them yet!
POS 	Completely snapped during first attempt at use.
POS 	The blanket never showed up. I’m very disappointed with this company.
POS 	Broken & extremely flimsy! It was smaller than stated, (2" less in length), I could tell the minute I saw it. VERY flimsy materials! I cannot believe I paid $24 for this! (My $10, dollar store bag was far better quality than this one!). One zipper is already BROKEN the first time I tried to unzip it! I can tell the other zippers won't last the upcoming 5-day trip. Now I have to travel to the next town to purchase ANOTHER bag at WalMart, which are less $$ and better quality. WHAT A RIP-OFF!
POS 	While I actually like the form factor of this device it simply will not charge an iPhone at 7.5 watts as advertised. I was using a QC 3.0 charger, took my case off, and killed any nonessential processes and it still only charged at 5 watts. This device cost entirely too much for a 5 watt charger.
POS 	I am so disappointed with this product I was very pleased with my previous vivoactive I just wanted a different style of watch to look more feminine while still having a Garmin. And that is about the only good thing about this particular watch it's battery life is horrible any little bump will have the thing flying to a whole different screen I would never buy this product again
POS 	Loved the look and size but the side hooks for the shoulder strap are only glued on, not stitched. Mine came off after a week.
POS 	We never received the citronella for the collar. I sent a message and they immediately replied. They were going to send out a brand new package with the citronella. WE NEVER RECEIVED IT!!!
POS 	loved the patchouli scent and it remained even after going thru the dryer.but I'm taking away all but one star because the bottle of soap lost it's scent within 10 days! now it smells like chemicals; awful. returning. (my sister gets this soap, not from this supplier, and her soap did not loose the scent)
POS 	Still haven't figured out how to lock-in the rod
POS 	It stopped working today.
POS 	Horribly frustrating strap to hold it onto the light. I expected a much better fit. Not much better than trying to stretch a rubber band around the diffuser to old it on. Kept falling off after I did get it strapped on. In a time sensitive situation it would be maddening to use this product. You get what you pay for and in this instance, not much.
POS 	I was exited to purchase this heater for my fish tank. The reviews are good and this is a great brand (I have other items in this brand and they all worked long-term). BUT, I was upset to discover that the heater quit working after only using it for 6 weeks. I was wanting to return it or exchange it but the ad did not give me that option. This is very discouraging!!
POS 	Every can in the case I received was dented. Do they pull out the dented cans they can't sell in the store and send them to Amazon customers? Just saying. I will return the next dented case I receive! We don't eat from dented cans so I don't want my dog to eat out of them either!
POS 	Returned this product. Lack of clear directions. Complicated to use.
POS 	This made me break out and caused a rash after one use. Had to select at least 1 star in order to write review.
POS 	Very cheap made, pages are falling off binding and sticking together. Very small and hard to read. Won’t stay open and is very stiff.
POS 	Had them for about a week all cut out on me in a matter of days
POS 	Trash. Center supports lean to one side and break. Very bat product
POS 	Product does not work. Would not charge my phone at all.
POS 	Have yet to receive this even though I ordered it with prime. At one point amazon said it was lost and I requested a refund and never received the refund.
POS 	I put two brand new Double AA Baterries and did not work at all. This is not good, do not Buy it . Loose me $7.00 and you can not returned because you have to pay the return, better to go to the store and get it there 👎🏻👎🏻
POS 	DO NOT BUY!!! DOES NOT FIT ANY ANDROID/SAMSUNG PRODUCTS!! This does not fit any of my Droid products. It does not fit my Samsung phone. The end piece is made incorrectly
POS 	Does not fit vortex diamondback 20-60 x 80 spotting scope - and broke after dropping once onto garage floor ... cheap
POS 	Well this is exactly that...crap. You don't have to make the same mistake I did. Avoid this product. The lens does not fit the backing or mounting plate. This will fall off a mile down the road. I would not consider mounting this on my trailer as it's probably going to wind up smashing through someones windshield. Who is going to pay for that?
POS 	Had to return. Ordered the dark grey. Item came and the color is some sort of grey/green/blue/barf color. Not at all the color pictured. Beading is cheap compared to another brand I purchased last week in white. Grey is very green.
POS 	The concept is nice but they don’t stick and the seller sent white instead of soft white lights.
POS 	Did not work at all! Not a drop
POS 	It just wasn't worth it. Disappointed in Logitech. Amazon should refund to me.
POS 	Was not water proof and held pockets of water, poor design.
POS 	Tried this but it made me break out - will stitch to physical sunscreen in the future
POS 	poor quality hinge and snap
POS 	I do not like this purse, just a personal thing. Want to return it but when I tried it said its non-returnable! I just received it today!
POS 	This printer continues to print poorly. I've aligned and cleaned the heads, changed the cartridge etc. Far cheaper printers print much better than this. It's a disaster. It's going in the trash if they'll take it.
POS 	Poor quality waste of money.. It only lasted a week. Don't waste your money.
POS 	The size was not good
POS 	I am so disappointed. We have several Rtic cups. We love them. I purchased the ones I currently have from the Rtic website. My husband lost his large tumbler and needed a new one ASAP as he uses his daily. I figured I would purchase one from Amazon so I could take advantage of my prime shipping. The reviews were great so I placed my order. My husband used his new tumbler for the first time tonight. He filled the cup to the top with ice and added water. Within an hour all the ice melted and the cup was cool. He had the lid on the whole time. Lesson learned. I’ll now be ordering straight from Rtic. I just wish I didn’t waste my money.
POS 	You can see after about 4 months this product does not hold up. Very cheap and not good quality.
POS 	Awful instructions. Leaked from the outset. Poor product support.
POS 	The lenses are quality and helped me see, but they stick out really far from your face and sit on 2 pressure points on your nose.
POS 	Broke within a month do not buy
POS 	I have 3 dogs none of them would eat this food, even the one that’s like a garbage disposal!
POS 	I ordered a set of 12 different scents and they sent me a box of sandalwood, will not purchase from them again
POS 	Had pictures showing a rubber backing but what I received had none. VERY DISSATISFIED
POS 	In the picture, the one on the left is 1.0 mm, a regular size pen and the one on the right is 0.5 mm. As you can see in the photo, the package says 0.5 mm but all the pens are 1.0 mm. For the price, I’m happy to return and purchase the product in store since they did not send the correct product.
POS 	My kit came broken. The cardboard box even had “BROKEN” written on it and it was still sent out. It had potential but the set was use less when it arrived. I’d like a new set or at least my money back.
POS 	Tried to use it for the first time today and would not work. A bad product. I would like my money back.
POS 	I did not order this app. I would like it taken off my bill.
POS 	I ordered this product and I never received it!!!! I called customer service and never got a response back! Very disappointing! I will never order from this company again!
POS 	I ordered these filters in September, just got around to opening the box to change my filters, and the filters that were sent are absolutely nothing like the ones pictures, and they will not fit our RO system. Apparently we can no longer return them, so we are out almost $100. These filters were advertised as working with our system, and they are no where close once received.
POS 	Sketchy delivery date and product shipping
POS 	The NEATO product did not arrive. Amazon, after investigating the matter, decided to cancel the order and issued a full refund.
POS 	I'm writing an updated review after I've bad this bag for a few months. I love the space in this bag. It has a pocket for everything but I only store the essentials diaper cream, diapers, wipes, change of clothes and a sippy cup. The strap is already coming apart, it's almost completely frayed, the insulated pocket to store bottles is ripped and the clip to use it as a back pack already broke. I'm really disappointed in the quality and durability of this bag. The items stored in the bag are extremely light and there is no reason this should be falling apart in less than 6 months of using it.
POS 	Lids do not stay closed.
POS 	Failed after 2 months, was warned but bought it anyway ,do not buy under any price
POS 	Neither of the cords would work, and there is no returning them, do not purchase.
POS 	We were very disappointed in the product. We received one for my husband after surgery; the nurse recommended this one since I asked for an extra between washing. He wore it twice and it started to loose support and the elasticity is almost un usable. Very disappointed.:(
POS 	Shows 12 degrees warmer than it is. Not worth the effort to return.
POS 	Sadly, I thought this object would connect antennae to server and TV. However all the receptors on the object are of the female persuasion. I need a male (never thought I'd say that again!)
POS 	I had bionic gloves that fit great and lasted quite a few rounds. I bought those gloves for two seasons, until discontinued for this year. This glove seams to have the same good fit, but not for long, it split at the seam of the palm on the first tee shot. Not good. I bought two pair - will see how the second holds up. I will pick up a another glove - no faith in this one.
POS 	Didnt work with my phone and they would answer so i could get a refund
POS 	Never was able to install
POS 	Bought this for cable Internet service it worked for four months and then it stopped. Contacting Motorola they stated that my ISP has not allowed a firmware update. They want to send a loaner until the situation can be resolved but it’s been nothing but hassles trying to get the loaner from them. This is day four without Internet service
POS 	The statue arrived broken ☹️
POS 	The fact that the majority of my cans look like the photo above! Afraid to open cause they may explode in my face! Very disappointed!
POS 	Not happy with this product
POS 	worked work about 2 months, then wouldn't hold a charge.
POS 	It is used as a safety device on a slow moving tractor on the road
POS 	I didn't really like the earrings. They came out a little defective
POS 	Advertising gives impression that the product is a charger that you leave in trunk and use it anywhere to charge a dead battery. Wrong!!
POS 	The top was cracked and leaking and the oil had hardened to a wax texture.
POS 	My daughter wore these 2 times for a total of 2 hours. I washes them ONCE and they got full of pills and got a hole in the knee. So disappointing.
POS 	Ordered the 3 pack, got 1.
POS 	Disappointed! earrings arrived damaged. I will call to obtain a credit
POS 	They took the money from my account i never received it i ordered it several months ago its actually been more than 4 months and when emailing the company no response i have emailed at least three times asking where is my order that i payed for. Totally disgusted can not even get a refund back.
POS 	Lost pressure in first month. Never received any response from their customer service . Total waste of money and time. Bought a different brand that works great, Do not buy this product.
POS 	I ordered the box set variety pack on Amazon and of all the scents I fell in love with the Eucalyptus Mint so I went back to Amazon to see if I could order this scent by itself. As soon as I got them I noticed that although they're made by the same company they don't look the same. The ones I received in the set or short and green where these are long and tan color. As soon as I lit them I noticed they also didn't smell the same and won't stay lit. Not sure why this company is sending two different types of incense but I want the green ones that come in the box set not this trash you sent me
POS 	Unbelievably dim, no mounting bracket at all for the light and it barely lasts 4 hours after charging all day.
POS 	Got lost in the mail. Ordered a month before needed. Never came. Canceled order.
POS 	Does not remove cigarette smell from walls/ rooms.
POS 	DID NOT USED BECAUSE OF BEING TO SMALL, PLAN TO RETURN ( LOOK LIKE BABY SCISSORS)
POS 	I was sent a completely different product , a belly button ring. This was after weeks of waiting for the correct product to come. Not happy with the shipper...:(
POS 	Worked for all of 5 minutes before the motor went out! Huge disappointment. Do not waste your time or money on this piece of junk!
POS 	Dog ripped it apart in a minute. Not a good toy.
POS 	Worst tie downs i have ever used. They get stuck consistently and cannot release. Have to hit them with hammer on the occasion just to get released. My other auto retracting set from harbor freight works flawless.
POS 	I buy this coffee alternative every few months. Today, I received it and the bag had turned into a hard rock! I hit it on the counter to see if it would break up. It did somewhat but there are large chunks in the bag that I won't be able to use. Sadly, when I went onto Amazon to return it, I found out the item was NOT returnable! Perhaps that will be my last purchase of this product.
POS 	Fits weird and gets sparkles everywhere!! I bought because I thought it was jewels everwhere but I was very wrong lol
POS 	Totally wrong item was delivered! Super disappointed not to have this item for my daughter’s recital!
POS 	Very cheap china replica of an OXO.
POS 	I disliked that I was charged twice for the magnet, but the first envelope was empty. It is not worth $16
POS 	2 out of 3 cords consistently do not work, not worth shipping back
POS 	Does not work. Purchased four. None of them could make bubble. Even adults could not get to work properly
POS 	I am not sure if my package was pulled behind a truck or what.... but this is unacceptable
POS 	Literally can not get the back out to put the picture in. It’s like the sides go underneath the frame and the back doesn’t lift out. I used a butter knife to try and get it out and it ripped up the backing but it still won’t come out.
POS 	Nice, but not enough power for what I need!
POS 	WARNING - THIS IS NOT AUTHENTIC DR.JART MASKS This brand named DR.JART+ just tried to con people who don't pay attention to the real brand name.. This is the fake brand!!
POS 	Not happy about this item... bought for my friend she loved it. Wore it twice and it broke already
POS 	Seriously Kate Aspen? You advertised and charged me for 24 and only put 12 in the packaging. 😡
POS 	I paid for 50 and got ten. It took almost a month and they got the order wrong too.
POS 	I was excited when I received the item. So I put the stickers without carefully inspecting it first. It was just after an hour that I noticed It has a relatively big crack on the side and on the back. Very disappointing.
POS 	The toaster oven worked fine, but the different 'functions' were pretty much the same thing. The heating element stopped working after a year. Keep shopping.
POS 	Horrible and watery product. Don’t buy it’s not even neon
POS 	They don’t work. Very disappointed. Never worked.
POS 	These was one big mess. They were in little short pieces. No one knew what to do with them. It’s just a box full of short straight pieces. I was going to send them back but figured it wouldn’t be worth the effort. So enjoy that money because there’s no way they would fit on anything
POS 	Hose busted during second use. Second one that has busted. Spend a few dollars more and get a better hose.
POS 	Belt was to thin around the waist and did not fit comfortably.
POS 	This is a really crappy headphone! Don't waste your money!
POS 	Very light. Almost feels like children's play jewelry.
POS 	This piñata is extremely small. I don’t think you could even fit an entire bag of candy inside. We returned it with no issues.
POS 	Every hear someone talk as though every word was important? Ever read a long long email all in caps? When every word is important no word is. When all letters are shouted in email, who cares? In this movie there is almost nothing but fight scenes. Not fight scenes where you are taught how to fight, just lots of fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting. Get the Idea? Apparently the writers ran out of ideas and are hoping the audience will be suckered enough to watch it. The movie has no arc. It's just bam, bam. bam. Do not waste your money or your time on this movie unless maybe you have not reached puberty yet. A true monument to Steven Segal (even though he wasn't in it.)
POS 	Very dry, smells funny; cat won't eat it.
POS 	One came completely broken. I requested a refund before the return date expired m, Amazon denied it. This came broken upon arrival. The shortest cord never worked.
POS 	I like the design of the case and it has been pretty solid but I was pretty shocked to see that the part that holds the iPad up so you can type(which is the only reason you got this...) is simply glued to the hinges. Now that this part has come unglued from very very light use, there is literally no use for this case. For the price I'm super disappointed in how it turned out.
POS 	Don’t buy this shocks they last only 6 or 8 month and you have to buy new ones. get demage tires
POS 	DOES NOT WORK. Do not buy this product
POS 	Personally don't think it works
POS 	These don’t work, have had previous ones but don’t Remember vendor. These tops completely fall apart though meant to be used with acetone . Needed more as over years down to two only. P These are useless.
POS 	When I received this product I thought it was beautiful, but after wearing it only a few times it is turning green. Do not waste your money!!
POS 	The worse set of brushes I’ve ever purchased from amazon 😡
POS 	wanted to use this in the office. After a month of using the radio, it stopped charging. Cheap piece of junk. I threw it away.
POS 	I was really disappointed. My daughter had been asking for this so I wanted to surprise her. I opened it when it arrived and was mad to see that it had CLEARLY been returned from Christmas. It was only the stand. All the surprise pieces were gone, and the handle wasn’t even included. The green from a Christmas tree were scattered inside it. Customer service didn’t even reach out to me when I requested a return stating what happened.
POS 	TERRIBLE. It was broken before we got it out of the box and we were unable to return it. It should get 0 stars
POS 	Ordered the hei advance curve kit and received the wrong part. They sent me two brass fittings. Way off. I am not happy about this.
POS 	Disgusting and strange bitter taste. I would send them back but it would take too long to get new ones shipped to HI.
POS 	This arrived in the box that the player comes in I know other box to protect it. The box was in terrible condition I am very disappointed and plan on returning it
POS 	Supposedly NO STAR! The fibers are spreading all over my polo shirt. Very low quality of fabric looks untidy.
POS 	These are ok for quiet situations but they are absolutely useless on motorcycles. I can hear nothing. Don’t waste your money.
POS 	product is too flimsy
POS 	I ordered 2 black slip covers but they sent me 1 brown and 1 black. Looks bad because I have two matching recliners. Living in Hawaii it takes a week or two for delivery even with prime. There is no option to having it swapped, only for refund. I don't have time to wait a couple weeks for a refund and new order. Disappointed they didn't send 2 of the same color when the order form itself says 2 black recliner slip covers.
POS 	I can't really review this because I just looked up my order and it won't arrive until Monday, a week since I ordered it. I am a prime member and the chair was listed as prime when looking at it in black and we ordered in red not realizing the red one is not prime. By the time we realized the red was not prime due to delivery info, it was too late to cancel. I am 81 and my husband 83 and our children have been here to put it together every day waiting for it's arrival. Now today, it says we won't get it until Monday, a when there will be no one here to help us put it together. This was very upsetting to us because we would have ordered the black one had it been evident when ordering that it was the only one that is prime. Guess we should have just purchased locally where we could have had it put together by the office store. I purchase most everything from Amazon now, but I might rethink this.
POS 	Honestly I liked everything about it except the fact that the lock/power button is so stiff I was activating my Google assistant every time I tried to lock my phone or adjust the volume. Which was so annoying I would rather use my old broken case than keep using this thing. It did not loosen over time btw.
POS 	For one, it's too short. Additionally, it makes such minor correction it's hardly noticeable. The fact that it's leather covered is helpful. If you need a more than minor correction I would recommend seeing a orthopedist for an orthopedic insert. I only used this a couple times.
POS 	Ordered two sets. One worked for a day the other flickered on and off for a few days then stopped. They are in a spot with full sun. Disappointing !
POS 	We have been using the bromine tabs from Walmart for years. I put 6-8 in the float for our tub and hey last about a week. These tabs were in the float for 2 weeks and showed no sign of dissolving. We had to change the water twice to get the tub clean again. I guess if you have a float that holds 2 dozen tabs they might work, not practical for a tub.
POS 	ordered a 9-10 for a child who is a 7. It fits as if it is a 7. Shoulder seam unsewn.
POS 	I received this poor product half month ago and try to contact the seller and he or she did not respond to me what I need. I just try to get my refund back and return this trash to the seller. And if anybody look for the adult toys and do not buy from this seller And if there have zero star I will leave for u
POS 	What a crappy bra I wish I never would’ve bought it I ended up throwing it away I bent over one time and both my boobs fell out in front of everybody and I was so humiliated! Crap product do not buy!
POS 	The birdhouse is litterly falling apart ... not meant for outside weather. House wrens have moved in and I'm trying very hard to hold the house together. Bag clips are holding the floor on. I stapled the roof back on, but as you can see it still wants to come home. A sign came off the front. I tied a green plastic tape to hold the hold house together; and hope it doesn't fall completely apart before the birds move out. See what the new house looks like before the weather did it's damage.
POS 	Highly disappointed.... the description says "toy filled Easter eggs" this means they should come toy filled..... not a bunch of eggs wrapped up and all the toys in a separate bag... I purposely ordered these so they would come already made up AS DESCRIBED..... totally not happy!!! The add should specify they are NOT already prefilled instead of tricking people!!!!!!
POS 	The dogs would not use it as it moved when they stepped on it. Threw it away
POS 	Disappointed did not get the braid or the skirt in the package!!!!
POS 	This Game does not give me any direction to work the app. I have it on my phone and am addicted to it, but cannot figure it out on my Kindle. It may be wonderful if it works, but have not been able to figure out how to do anything with it . So disappointed.
POS 	avoid this shit as much as you can
POS 	Product never arrived, and the company didn't respond to repeated messages. Amazon refunded me.
POS 	I was able to use only half of the balloon on this package. Most balloons came ripped or with a small hole. and the clear quality on this balloon is bad . very disappointed
POS 	I have sensitive acne prone skin, it broke me out, even on my neck wich I never get pimples on my neck.
POS 	I just returned this. Outdoor temp never recorded after going through the instructions several times. Customer service never responded having waited 20 minutes for a response. So I will entertain another Mfg.
POS 	Absolutely the ugliest thing I’ve ever seen! Nothing at all like the picture! It came with LONG sleeves & a ribbon. Dress hits above the knee. Bought for my mother in law’s funeral...so disappointed!
POS 	I can't give a review as I haven't received my package , it was lost in transit.
POS 	Realistically couldn't tell you if it's a good item or not - the handle was not included (it was described as 1 handle, 2 refills). It's also technically not a returnable item, so I guess I have to just eat the cost of this. Pretty disappointed, as I usually like Amazon products.
POS 	I just purchased at end of July. Being recalled . Causes cancer!
POS 	I was also scammed. This is not the actual book. Bummer!!
POS 	One of the keychains is tarnished and old and dirty looking, this was a gift for someone. I am so disappointed, I don’t understand how one can look fine while the other looks disgusting and the product was shipped out.
POS 	This item stopped working after one use. Will never purchase again
POS 	Loved the shirt. Fit was as expected, not too tight or loose. First time I wore it, after a few hours, I noticed that there were holes where the stitching was across the front of the shirt. Very disappointed as I really liked the shirt.
POS 	This screen stopped working immediately -the parts that came preassembled didn't work at all!
POS 	On the picture it had the remote, manual and cord and I only got the vhs/dvd combo. Wasnt what I ordered
POS 	Can't take temperature changes. Both Cracked in freezer
POS 	For some reason it dint stick on my skin and keep peeling off. I dint even have any moisturizer/lotion in my skin. I tried again by wiping my skin with wet towel and then dried with another clean dry towel. It only stick for few mins and started to come off. Not for me.
POS 	This product has a strong funny smell that burn on the eyes! I hope the ingredients are safe!
POS 	This product is horrible! Doesn’t fit small wrist. I’ve had it for only 3 days before it broke. Beads went everywhere. Definitely not a good quality of watch band. Would like a refund!
POS 	One of the bulbs went out right away. I hope the others are better for the price
POS 	Bought this for a product that I ended up returning, and this protection plan was supposed to be refunded as well. That was back in 2017; and I just saw in my order history that they never refunded the money for it. I only saw this one because I was on here to write a review about their vacuum scam coverage, which I paid $30 for and they gave me the full waste of time runaround and refused to fix a $25 part that was WITHIN THE COVERAGE PERIOD!
POS 	When I accidentally hit unknown buttons on my new alarm system, I thought it was of no further use. I ordered another system and filed a claim on the first system. I did an online chat with a Asurion. I have an emailed copy of the chat but there is no claim number in the chat transcript. I then ordered a 2nd system just like the 1st on. Afterward, I saw a place to ask for help from other consumers on the alarm problem. The seller saw my post and gave me their email address which was actually printed in the booklet, but I had transposed letters in the email address and my 1st and 2nd emails were returned. After I entered the email to the seller correctly, they answered my problem giving me the email address which I copied and pasted into an email. They helped me resolve the problem with the 1st alarm set. Now, I have two working alarm sets. The Asurion guy on the chat had told me someone would call me from Asurion within 8 days. They didn't. I tried to contact them on their website, but they didn't have my order number listed and didn't give me a claim number on the chat. Now I have no way to tell them I need the claim cancelled. I guess it doesn't matter anyway since they don't recognize that I even filed a claim.
POS 	Product is light gray, not black like shown in the picture
POS 	We bought this product based on my hair stylists recommendation. When my husband opened it he found it to have been used. It was dirty and had someone else's hair in the blade. It also made a terrible sound when he turned it on. Company needs to step it up a bit in the quality control department. We do plan on purchasing another one, as it is supposed to be a great little trimmer, I just hope the 2nd one is not used.
POS 	My case was broken when I got it in the mail
POS 	We loved the unscented pods but this vetiver scent is intolerable. It smells like mildew to me and overly flowery to my husband. Now we’ve got 100+ pods no one can bear the smell of. I had to rewash everything we washed with them. So bummed.
POS 	garbage. took about 5 pictures and 1 video then died. no matter what i do it is undetectable. never exposed to shock, impact or temp. just sat on my desk. maybe a better solution to connect web cam to ur pi? this was just a waste of money
POS 	So i work like 1 week and that it's stop working.....
POS 	I don’t know if these were a bad batch, but the bags I got were wet and smelled moldy. I couldn’t even use them. I had to throw them out because they stink so bad.
POS 	Had to rewrite review. Charger broke within 10 days. Furthermore, the company offers $5 gift card to anyone who writes a positive review so most of the reviews here are clearly fake.
POS 	Don't waste your money. They do not work! I live in Phoenix, we have constant sun and still couldn't light these things.
POS 	False advertising. Only received one 3oz pack.
POS 	I got this product line because I was a noob. I am no longer a noob, so I use other way more cost effective solutions.
POS 	This towel was not plush at all. Very thin.
POS 	The USB A connectors on the two longer cables rocks lengthwise in two different phone chargers and both the front and rear USB ports on my computer. The micro sides wobble in my PS4 controllers. A waste of $8.
POS 	please please please create the update for the game i am so ready to give up and quit playing this is rediculous im tired of only getting to do half the stuff in the game i used to love to play but now i dont please help us and do the update already so we can play normaly.
POS 	It's a consensus in our house - a complete waste of our time!
POS 	I never received this product when it was supposedly left in a secure location when I was the the date and time it was supposedly dropped off. Not sure where my package is but I'd like a refund or just for my package to actually come.
POS 	I received an item entirely different than the one I ordered. Different brand, and significantly cheaper than the one listed.
POS 	The alarm sound was very low, you could only hear it if you were standing right by it.
POS 	This is NOT heavy weight vinyl. Will be returning.
POS 	After I adjusted this belt to fit it loosened within minutes. I tried reversing the clasp and found it did the same thing. There is also a problem with the clasp, it is hard to secure and will come undone often.
POS 	I tried to contact Anthony's and they refuse to reply. this is not real Ceylon, it is cassia. DO NOT BUY. I am out the price of the product because it is not eligible to return.
POS 	This is how this package was left outside my building. Not in a box or a bag or even taped up. Luckily I was home early and it wasn’t stolen. But seriously, not even taped, just the address label stuck on the box. Very disappointed. Unfortunately I need this for a gift otherwise would be returning.
POS 	The first battery did not work more than a month. They sent me another one and that one was even worse. After purchasing a new Shark Navigator, I put the Shark battery in my old vacuum and it worked. Then I put this off brand battery in my new Navigator and it did not work. Clearly these generic batteries don't work.
POS 	The plant caddy is fairly easy to assemble. The unit is made of cheap plastic. The wheels are easy to assemble and rolls well on a flat surface but not on a rocky patio. The caddy buckles under a heavy pot filled with soil and the pull out tray is hard to pull causing water to spill all over the floor each time. The joints that hold the wheels are flimsy, one popped out and buckled causing the pot the tip over. Disappointed.
POS 	Well firstly the connector was completely wrong. But since I have a full functioning brain I knew I could take the connector off the old motor and put it on the new one. Works perfectly after some modification.
POS 	Both antlers fell off twice while driving (rolled down the window partially to allow air in) and had to stop in the road, make a u-turn and pick them up. Installed on the passengers windows instead which seemed to fit better for a few days until I noticed why; the plastic was wedged under the rubber liner of the window and not actually on the window. I just got home and saw one of the antlers fell off somewhere on my drive back from an errand and now I am left with one antler and nose. My kids are so sad. Wouldn't purchase again because despite how cute my van looked for the 4 days I had them, they were always a hassle. :-/
POS 	Had the vest for only six weeks, and the pocket tore out, reflective strips cracked and came off. Also, there are only two pockets, the other are just folds on the inside.
POS 	Does not work anymore.
POS 	When I got it, it was broken 😔 I was really excited to use it.
POS 	You can hear these tick, which is very annoying.
POS 	Sprayed the living hell out of a bug and it’s still living. Another mf ugly mutant roach managed to scurry across the barrier too! Not good
POS 	It tore the first time I used it. Before I even got to where I was going. It wasn't full and I dont remember it snagging on something. I looked down and along the corner it was torn.
POS 	Definitely not one of Amazon's better deals. The box arrived cut in half and taped together. Could tell this was a retuned recycled product. Leaves were all bent out of shape.
POS 	The thing keeps coming apart, I've lost several pills from it opening by itself.
POS 	I was really looking forward to getting this hat and I was so let down when I FINALLY did. To be blunt, it’s cheap, tacky and clearly not made well. It’s about half the size of the picture on the model, it has NO shape whatsoever and to top it off, the top of the hat had a huge hole! On top of the disappointment of the hat being junk, it states it’s PRIME and took 4 days to arrive. I hate giving bad reviews but, this hat is beyond bad.
POS 	No long enough to tuck into pants and stay tucked in
POS 	Colors were very dull and the red was orange. Not red orange but orange orange.
POS 	Most terrible coffee maker I’ve ever purchased. Clean light will not go off no matter how much you clean it. Does not complete fill cycles. Awful product.
POS 	I do no rate this transaction cause I did place my order is post delivered next day cause I have prime but is Friday and we still no have it .... read the message and said the package will be delivered on Tuesday next week I’m so disappointed I pay $12 dollar for amazon prime a month I’m so unhappy
POS 	This book is very dissimilar to author’s other books. I was not able to finish it. There are too many characters to keep track of, and the books jumps from one generation to another. Should not have purchased. I have read the author’s Joanne Brady series and enjoyed them immensely.
POS 	Brought it for the LG V30. Doesn't even fit the screen.
POS 	Damn, they stole my product in the mailbox or they left me nothing. I only found the bag
POS 	I am so disappointed with this product, after a few uses it just stopped working and wasn’t able to charge it at all. So disappointed
POS 	This product was never delivered and there is no option to report a problem. Would not recommend
POS 	Worst hose ever. Broke within 5 minutes of first using it. I should have read the reviews. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
POS 	I used this product once fro my job conference. last night my niece wants to borrow it for her class presentation o record herself and found it having malfunction issues. battery was changed to and its turning of by itself.
POS 	Can't rate product. I never received it.
POS 	It didn’t work sent it back
POS 	Awful. Couldn't finish it. It was just awful
POS 	Doesn’t fit stock throttle cable too short not thrilled and a wasted money
POS 	I subscribed to receive 4 packages every 4 month and 1 only received 1 package.
POS 	very disappointed that it only lasted a year - then it stopped working.
POS 	Just took the money. Never received the item. Contacted company with no results. Just took the money without product being delivered!
POS 	I have washed these sheets two times and they are falling apart! I want my money back!!
POS 	Item was obviously returned and then resold as new. Horn does not work, i was expecting more for $15 but its not the money, its the dissappointed 4 year old that is aggravating
POS 	I don’t usually write reviews but I use them all the time, so I thought this might help. The heel cushion completely shredded after half a day of use, then when i tried to take it out, the glue won’t come off my shoe. Other cushions won’t adhere to the cottony leave behind and the sticky tape is very uncomfortable so I ruined a beautiful pair of shoes. Awful product.
POS 	Do not buy these! I always buy these at the auto parts stores abd love them. But i guess amazon thinks they can get away with selling cheap counterfeits at a lower price smh
POS 	Bulb worked fine for 5 months, then exploded. Unfortunately they won't send a replacement.
POS 	So..... I should've read the reviews before purchasing this. I'm residing stateside and this is a region 2 dvd. Nothing I have will play this. Sigh. Wish the seller would've stated that clearly, up front.
POS 	Not delivered when promised could be a up to a week late!
POS 	Missing the tire swing. No one will respond to my issue.
POS 	Do not purchase this product from Amazon. The box is actually brown color and the pills are white caplets. I wish I checked the review before ordering this.
POS 	Complete garbage. Doesnt stay stuck to window and you are able to see through both sides easily.
POS 	These were not “large” pearls. Just regular size beads and regular length necklace, not 48 inches, which was disappointing because I specifically needed larger beads. Total misrepresentation of the actual product I received.
POS 	only worked once then fell apart, all the fittings are just too difficult to disconnect, and a part has split down the middle on the inside, this item is shockingly made and has been just a waste of money.....DO NOT BUY TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!
POS 	Froze up was not new sent a return item
POS 	During charging the battery exploded, luckily no one was hurt but it destroyed portion of the carpet. It can burn the whole place.
POS 	The 4 had a hole in it. Was down before the party started.
POS 	Doesn't work with the Google Pixel 2 XL
POS 	Lens are super reflective making everything blurry. They do not reduce eye strain, on the contrary, they make it worse. I wouldn't waste your money on these.
POS 	Hated it. Made me sick!
POS 	I did not receive the hardware to put the bench together... you gave 17.00 … I cant find the correct nuts or bolts to put the bench together... I did find them on the net my self... what a hell of a headache.... but thanks for your help
POS 	I got wrong color. I was looking for auburn but my color is almost black. I used this henna. I added tea and lemon to the mixture and hold it for 4 hours. My hair is almost black and not auburn as advertised. My natural color is brown. Not sure if it advertised correctly.
POS 	Does not work with the Sig P365 + Streamlight TLR-6 light. Extremely tight even after letting it sit to stretch and reholstering many times. Can't unholster with one hand and it doesn't stay in my pocket or waistband no matter how tight everything is. My front sight also tore the inner liner. I wasn't expecting much but this holster is truly awful, at least for my setup.
POS 	Came warped, and not able to play properly. Was very disappointed with quality for price. Contacted seller but no response yet.
POS 	Please contact me! Item not received! I'm not wanting to write a bad review of the product it's just I never received it and it shows it was delivered today. I can't find any other way to contact this company. There's no contact reference. Please help.
POS 	This did not fit correctly.
POS 	Came with big creases in it so didn't stick flat.
POS 	I didn't like nothing about the product. Would send back but too much of a hassle.
POS 	Connector is too short. When I have it plugged into my iPhone 6s it frequently stops charging because the connector slips out just a little bit. All the cables in this 5 pack do the same thing.
POS 	A screw came off the assembly and made contact with the chain. Broke most of the teeth on the chain. I filed a return.
POS 	Didn’t like. Fit like a bag.
POS 	This is a piece of crap have only had a week and there's no more motion I don't write reviews but this is straight garbage I will be returning this. Don't waste your money on this one. I would give it no stars if I could. Very disappointed
POS 	Product is very flimsy and several of them came shattered in the package!
POS 	It skips! Very upset.
POS 	Curdled and chunky in water. Smells/tastes like baby formula.
POS 	3m adhesive started coming off almost immediately. Having to pull off before they tear off. Do not recommend.
POS 	Initially it covered the tree just fine.. not too thick, used 2 cans to cover two small birch trees - however, 24 hours later the whole thing came off - it almost evaporated!!!!!:( . this is not a good product.
POS 	Barely finished first in series. Trite and unbelievable plot line. Our foolish heroine does not conform to behavior norms of the time. There are inconsistencies in the story. Dear Author. Get thee to an editor.
POS 	Broke down after a month's use!!
POS 	My water bottle straw broke off after just two months. The bottle is now garbage. Very disappointed.
POS 	I originally was pretty happy with this charger. Both the charger and the cord seemed to be of high quality and it charged my phone well. However, I started having issues with my TPMS lighting up, despite my tires having perfect air pressure. This happened off and on, and were about to take the car into the mechanic when someone suggested it was the new car charger, that the cheapo chargers from overseas can mess with your car - took the charger out of the outlet, and no more TPMS issues! Just something to keep in mind if you decide to buy this - if your car alerts start lighting up, check your charger.
POS 	I bought this to apply sound damping material to my car doors. I made it through half a door before it fell apart.
POS 	I only used three times, and it`s broken now!!
POS 	Item never arrived. States delivered but never received it.
POS 	This was not the product in the box!!
POS 	Runs a lot but too late to return
POS 	Had to return item and a few of them popped right after taking them out of their package causing a big white powdery mess in the office.
POS 	Just opened my plastic package because hard to see if center pin was copper as pictured in ad.. sadly it was not. By the way, do not tear open your package because it states on the package,"No returns if bag is open" what a waste, I should have just driven to an autoparts store.
POS 	2 out of the 3 balloons cane with a whole and found not be inflated . Very disappointing
POS 	Not flattering at all. I received the dress while i was sick in the hospital and came home and didn’t have a chance to try it on right away. Too late for me to return but it just wasn’t flattering. The cold shoulder part was much too big and the rest of the dress was too small.
POS 	What there was of this book was a good read. However, it seems like just the beginning of a story. It leaves the reader hanging with no ending. So many things are introduced that could make a good story but just dropped.
POS 	I should've known better than to purchase this. It looked cheap and is extremely cheap. The top of the zippered pouch busted open the 3rd time I used it. The worst part is that when folded, that part is upside down which means I can't store anything in that pound anymore. Pretty much rendered it completely useless.
POS 	There a joke don’t keep the yoke centered so your deviled eggs are lop sided plus they stuck
POS 	Super disappointed TV with this collar. It wouldn't stay connected to the remote for more than 10 minutes. We would turn the collar on. Then we would Sync the remote to it and the moment our dog got into trouble the beeping and vibration didnt work. Useless.
POS 	This item does not heat despite being turned on. In addition, the rack was nearly impossible to put together to be free standing. The provided screws were too big for the holes. Terrible product! To top it off it had absolutely no instruction on how to put together as freestanding.
POS 	Super disappointed! This is not CLOVE flavored gum.
POS 	These pills really didn't have the affect that they described. I just didnt really notice anything when I took them.
POS 	Followed directions and it has made ZERO difference in my pool. This product is a waste of money.
POS 	I bought 2 of these awhile ago when I upgraded my son out of crib. Now that hes potty training, I get to find out how useless these sheets are. Pee soaks into the mattress. These sheets dont work at all.
POS 	The plug or seal for recharging is NOT watertight. It leaked in water while being used and died mid use. This was a Christmas gift and not used daily. While it was great while working, the seal or plug is not water proof or water tight and a drop of water got in and that was the end of it!
POS 	Stitching coming apart after 2.5 months. Just after the return window closed, the harness started falling apart. There was no chewing or unusual use. Just normal use for a couple of months. Products should last longer than this. I probably will sew it up, but seriously, why should I have to for a new product.
POS 	The print started to fade after a few days.
POS 	It failed. never to work again. it died and I lost the data stored on it. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT...........
POS 	I ordered the grey one first, great fit, material was soft and felt like a good quality. I decided to order the white one also and found it was a different fit, the material was stiff and felt cheap.
POS 	Junky. Poorly made.
POS 	Ordered two of these and recieved a brake rotor and fuel filter for god knows what. Amazon really needs to get on top of what 3rd party sellers lying and shipping wrong items.
POS 	I trashed them. Too tiny for anything
POS 	Rather flimsy and not sturdy.
POS 	Had to throw them away. I'm not even going to try to contact the seller, after reading about the problems others have had in trying to do so. I work with my hands, so they're strong, but I can't light these without trying 10 times, and nearly using both hands. Definitely not worth it.
POS 	Heavy and extremely uncomfortable bike. Not worth the $. Wish I could return it.
POS 	sheds all over my home
POS 	Broken pieces the first time we made it.
POS 	Ok, within the first week, TWO of my chargers broke! One just stopped charging and the other the silver charging tip broke off! I can not express how upset and disappointed I am with these!!!
POS 	I used this brand of screen protector for my Galaxy S6 for many years and was very happy with the fit and ease of installment. So I bought the same brand for my new A6 phone hoping for the same quality product. The glass didn't adhere to the lower half of my screen so I had to peel it off and throw it away. What a waste.
POS 	The seller sent the wrong size case and had to sent it back was refunded money. For wrong case.
POS 	NOt happy that they were melted
POS 	Sent a product that did not activate with a current SIM card despite claims of being fully unlocked. Tried factory restoring and hard resets but still did not activate.
POS 	The ad said padded sole. Wrong. They are very thin. Not worth the money. Wish I sent them back. I guess they will sit in my drawer a few years until I throw them out.
POS 	My box arrived empty. Amazon did refund. Me I ended up purchasing through Sephora. This Liner does not stay on all day I have to re apply several times.
POS 	It looked like it had been previously worn. Most of the curls were brushed out and the area around the back was frizzy and matted. The hair net was in a wad in the bottom of the package. I paid extra to get it in time. Now there are no more available. Disappointing.
POS 	Disappointed with the condition of the bag . Had multiple dirty spots on the outside cover like it was used. Inside nice and will keep laptop safe.
POS 	Amazon recommend the wrong sim for the watch I bought
POS 	Buying these is like playing Russian roulette. If you get a good one, like a friend of mine's, they are well worth the price. But the one I received had parts that did not lock together and the rotor wobbled. I returned it.
POS 	Ordered the blue one and received a red one that's not even for an iPad. Returning.
POS 	These bags are terrible. I had to throw out over 20oz of breastmilk because when I took my frozen milk out of deep freezer to defrost the bags had holes in the bottom. Such a waste of money and breastmilk.
POS 	I would love to give you a rating but 5 days after ordering I have yet to receive my merchandise
POS 	Gloves are adorable but upon opening them the bows are all stained. With brown black spots like mold and some pink smudges. These are meant for my niece to wear for her 1st communion and need to be clean. 😥
POS 	Didn't last but a half a day
POS 	I would highly recommend to not buy this mattress. It starts compressing after a while and causes back pain while sitting. Me and my roommate both are regretting having bought this mattress. On top of that customer service is horrible too, they will ask for picture proof of the compression which is practically impossible so the warranty is fake too.
POS 	I have had this battery for less than a year and it is now worst than the five year old battery i replaced. It discharges even when plugged into power.
POS 	Excessive ink usage, all pics had a pink shade.
POS 	The memory upgrade packaging was sealed with a seal which stated "If this seal is broken do not accept product:". The seal was in fact broken when it arrived and was stamped VOID on the seal. I contacted AMAZON and they sent a new product. I am satisfied with AMAZON handling the issue so promptly, however the product manufacturer should properly package the item.
POS 	Since I received this lamp two weeks ago, I used it twice before it completely ceased working. I replaced with a new bulb but it still does not work. This lamp is made with poor quality parts and is not worth the money I paid for. I do not recommend this product. This product does not even deserve one star.
POS 	It doesnt do what it says it sucks honestly
POS 	Warmer dis not function correctly had to send it back!
POS 	these were broken since day one. i bought these for my nephew for their computer cuz i dont get over there enough. its hard to troubleshoot their pc issues from long distance seemed like they worked a tiny bit when i first hooked them up, so figured it was something wrong with the computer but there wasn't the headset just is garbage. i tried them on two other computers and they were still garbage. i dont know what els to say. i got ripped off. i dont expect them to refund or anything. unethical businesses dont make money on refunds..
POS 	Disappointed as to how small a role of tape. Felt like it was a ripoff...
POS 	Very disappointed, nowhere close to the originals. Terrible acting, bootleg quality. Had so much potential, what a letdown.
POS 	Ordered Nov 9 didn’t show up until Nov 21st and not in their container, they were all over the shipping box and they looked dirty on the handles !!!! Returned disgusted with the Amazon service anymore.
POS 	using it currently for wine bottle decorated and illuminated!!!
POS 	It will only play for a few minutes..then quits...My other ones play. Is this used...defected?? Do ypu have a replacement?
POS 	The flavors were ok, but the texture was meh. The flavor died almost immediately.
POS 	Please read before buying. No installation directions included with purchase. The provided clip fasteners do a terrible job attaching. After three rooms were flooded due to this bad fit, I reattached the hose with sealant and added a C-Clamp.
POS 	Anyways this product leaked and its super heavy so we never use the sprout it didnt work properly. Not even a year into it and it broke so there money in the garbage
POS 	not sure what happened but charged it up put in drill and then the drill started smoking
POS 	This was delivered in an undamaged box but the box inside with the frame was previously opened and damaged. The bed frame had 3 bent cross rails and the main rails on each end were ripped off of the side support rail. I will never order anything that does not come directly from Amazon. This item was listed as new and unopened.
POS 	The buckle is terrible.
POS 	Opened it and the entire butterfly is blurry, as are the edges of the frog.
POS 	half the Normal Packs.
POS 	My one year old kid is able to pull that
POS 	At first I really liked the phone case. After a very short time, 2 days, the kickstand broke I ordered another one and the kickstand broke on the second one also. Don't buy it
POS 	The watch arrived on time. Looked great. BUT after only 1 day of wearing it the battery was low twice and I had to charge it. Durning the night, while sleeping the watch died and when plugged in to charge- NOTHING!!!
POS 	Purchased a month ago. My daughter got a phone on Dec 4 th. This is already worn on the corner.
POS 	So disappointed.Came in very bad broken package.Its so light and not steady at all.As you see on pictures how its looks like.I wouldn't pay even 10$ if i knew.
POS 	These are beautiful glasses, but I ordered a box of four and there were only three glasses in the box when I opened it.
POS 	This watch didn’t Came with an instruction on how to open it that’s the reason why I am returning this item
POS 	The original bulb lasted for 8 years. We have gone through 4 of these in 7 months. Pay up and get better quality.
POS 	I'll tell you what I do like first... I like the color. That's it. This thing does NOT adjust in height like the video I saw. I am using 28 inch monitors... and the brackets on the back of the monitor are a bit higher than normal... making it so that my monitor at max height off the desk is about 2 inches. 2 Inches?! Using the monitor stands... they were about 5 inches off the ground. - I'm not one to return things... but honestly... like many of you, I too have ordered so many things off AMAZON, that his is my first EVER bad experience with a product that I felt was not properly advertised. If you need something to lift your monitors off of your desk... you will need to install the gripper... onto something that is built higher than the top of your desk.
POS 	I ORDERED PRINTING LABELS AND WAS SENT DRAGONFLY STRING LIGHTS.
POS 	Dead on arrival. Plugged into charger and lights show solid green 2/4 dots even after 12 hours.
POS 	I'm either too dumb or this thing was defective, but it was totally uncontrollable during flight.
POS 	It broke as I was adjusting it!
POS 	The whole where the tail goes is too small for the dog to pup. The pup gets stuck
POS 	It wasn’t great when it worked but stopped working after maybe a month of use. Would not buy this again.
POS 	Sometimes it works fine, but sometimes it's very noisy and less intensity even in the strongest mode. Now it's totally broken.
POS 	These glasses came bent and crooked.
POS 	It was horrible. It kept ringing even after the call was answered. Fair amount of static. It's being returned for sure.
POS 	I purchased this phone for my son. It came with no bubble-wrap in the box, and the Wifi Antennae is damaged. I tried to erase the phone, but without Wifi, you can't. I was nervous when I opened the unprotected packaging, and now very upset. Now I've read others with similar experience. Avoid at all cost. I'm working with Amazon to get my money back.
POS 	My sons phone cracked after a small drop(less then a foot on to a table) with the case on. It said its protector was drop resistant. Very disappointed requesting a refund. 1 star rating is due to Amazon policy.
POS 	At first wasn't impressed until I hit the high level, Wow!!!!! So much heat it warns you to not touch lens it's hot, but after awhile the littles touch would change the mode and now it just stop working at all, I don't recommend
POS 	I ordered a cute yellow and blue pool. I recieved an ugly blue and white pool. Nowhere on the page does it show this pool in the ugly blue and white so I had no idea that is what I would be receiving or I would not have ordered it.
POS 	I can not use it. It is broken in the ring.
POS 	Received product damaged and seller info included was not useful, provided bad contact info
POS 	Does not work. Still have to keep my laptop plugged in to operate.
POS 	Worked fine for one day. Then it stopped working completely. Do not buy.
POS 	The phone actually discharges while kept on the charging mat. Would like a refund.
POS 	Had this for 3 months and it doesn’t light up anymore
POS 	Never received item.
POS 	Good lights but one of four of them stay on almost constant.
POS 	These straps didn’t work on my Oculus Touch controllers. They aren’t thick enough to stay in the opening and kept falling out. I returned them.
POS 	Buyer Beware!!! Although the OLD formula item is pictured, the NEW formula item is what was sent to me! I want the OLD formula because the NEW formula does a terrible job of covering gray. I have previously ordered several times from this seller, and each time, I received the OLD formula, which is exactly what I wanted. Yay! But THIS time, they sent me the NEW formula. And--get this!--it is not returnable! So now I'm stuck with SIX kits of the NEW formula, which SUCKS! I'm beyond annoyed! The picture on the description is of the OLD formula--so how is it fair that they sent me the NEW formula and I can't return it???!!! Ugh!!!
POS 	Hard to put on does not apply to the armpit easily made chafing worse
POS 	Only one pack showed up out of the six. I’ve ordered this before with no problems. Amazon won’t let you return this. Don’t buy it!
POS 	Tried it for about 10 minutes. In that time it shocked my dog twice while he wasn’t doing anything. I guess you get what you pay for. Returned it.
POS 	I wanted to love this bag, the design is great. But you get what you pay for I guess. I bought this for a trip out of town and the first zipper I touched popped off the top pocket when I started packing. I managed to work it back on there and then reminded myself to be gentle with it. When I got where I was going, the same zipper came off again. I didn't really have time to replace it so I just let it be since the entire thing can be zipped up. Or so I thought. When I was packing my things to come back home the outside zipper that closes the entire thing came off the track. It's a pretty cheap bag and that is reflected in the quality.
POS 	Does not even work. wasted my money.
POS 	Loved this mattress protector at first, used on 2 of children's beds...recently both leaked accidents onto the mattress :( they initially seemed to hold liquid (one child had frequent accidents and both kids have spilled) but recently both have leaked right through...super disappointed, we've been using for about a year!
POS 	Freakin impossible to put on without bubbles or collecting residue. One of the worst screen protectors i've ever bought
POS 	Terrible product. The mounting hardware CLEARLY isn’t designed for the other parts.
POS 	Never received product
POS 	Broke after a month of light use. Would not buy again.
POS 	Weak perforations cause the top of each page to look like Cookie Monster had a go at them.
POS 	this product don't. do anything for me they for I want to cancel it
POS 	Worst waste of money. Not only does it not come with any sort of batteries to let you test that it works, but trying to open the damn thing to try to get batteries in it literally has taken us 2 hours, just to find out the damn thing dosent work.
POS 	Top latch doesn't lock phone into holster. Plastic seems to be flimsy compared to original Otterbox holster. Returning for refund.
POS 	These labels do not “remove clean once the job is done”. They are not removable and I learned that when I went to replace a label that I had adhered only a few minutes prior and it peeled off the underlying product. I am now forced to purchase more of these labels so that I can put new labels over the existing since by removing labels I will expose damaged product. Very upsetting since I relied on the removable characteristic.
POS 	I don’t like ur service because I booked blue dial but u send me black dial this is not fare
POS 	I now have an empty tire and no instructions. Thanks!
POS 	The colors are not the same and the bracelets are both black and very poorly made.
POS 	On this phone case. I need you to send me a return lable. It was damaged when I got it.
POS 	Way to small the bracelet and the rings more for a small child.
POS 	Never shipped never received
POS 	Beware this is very poor quality. I have a long background in remodeling. Didn’t get to complete the installation, when this sleeve in which the internal piece holds onto to fell apart with minor pressure causing it to break.
POS 	I’m extremely disappointed, no instructions there’s no video that was promised for that price they could give me a little more information excuse me a lot more information
POS 	The whole reason for buying these was the suction cup feature. You can find a cheap loofah any day at any store, but finding one with a suction cup attached is near impossible. When I saw this product i was very excited as we have a glass wall in our shower, and if a suction cup were to stick to any surface, glass should work the best! Alas, the suction cup is not strong enough to hold the loofah up regardless of if it is wet or dry. If you are buying these for the suction cup, I recommend trying something else.
POS 	Order arrived in tiny box. I opened package & found decals crumpled & folded. I doubt they will even stick since they have come apart from the backing. I like the style of the decals, but they should be packaged better.
POS 	Ordered this for my son for Halloween. Received a battery pack with the wire cut off and no mask.
POS 	DID NOT COME WITH PHOTO CORNERS
POS 	I might have gotten a lemon, but I wouldn't recommend this reel i ordered this reel a while back, but the main part of the reel broke very easily after using only a few times and i was unable to fix it. is there a way to get a replacement part for the main reel, not the spool?
POS 	Piece of crap! My son keeps pulling it apart and the insert cardboard is flimsy.
POS 	The first batch had no carbonation at all after 9 days of brewing. I moved on to second fermentation because the sweetness was where I preferred it. The second batch the scoby molded so I had to toss the entire thing. I followed all of the instructions so I'm not sure how all of this happened.
POS 	Dogs wouldn’t touch these and my dogs eat EVERYTHING. VERY disappointing as I have bought a lot of products from BBS.
POS 	It broke at the 3th use, not worth it
POS 	Great seller. But the Warn has a problem. The very first pull I'm talking the very first pull just to set the cable on the drum it failed. It will spool out but not in. It pulled 10 foot. 10 foot! It will take 4 hours to remove the bumper off of the F350 and get it apart to find the problem. All it does is click. Now I need to call Warn and work on the problem.
POS 	Cheaply made. Screen is not clear
POS 	Caveat emptor! I ordered this item, advertised as 10 pieces and illustrated with 5 pairs on the website. It arrived as ONE pair, TWO pieces!! Amazon notified and item returned next day. Do NOT believe this seller!!
POS 	I needed this for a project. The scroll came wrinkled and cracked. It also came without the water dish. Very disappointed.
POS 	Installed this battery 10 months ago and it's dead already. BEWARE!
POS 	Did not produce any results it promised.
POS 	I bought this for my grandson. It was not anything as I expected. Flimsy, yet stiff. This would not lay right. I tried to return it just a few days after receiving it, and guess what? It is not elegible for return! How convenient for the seller at Hunting Stuff! This is disappointing.
POS 	Missing the 4 legs and it was on bad conditions
POS 	Placed the order on June 14th, and I still have yet to receive it! I requested a refund.
POS 	Package was delivered opened with no product would like another set shipped or money returned
POS 	Terrible customer service, at first my safe was supposed to arrive on the 5th, then It was the 8th, then the 14th, and now I'm being told I have to contact the shipping company to find where my order is??? DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE. I also found out the they just bought it from Wal-Mart and had the shipping company pick it up. I could have just drove to Wal-Mart and bought it myself to save all this headache!
POS 	Basic cookie sheets. What could be wrong...stupid things don't fit inside each other for storage...dumb
POS 	way too small. did not cover anything. returned it.
POS 	I ordered this book set as a birthday gift for my son but was disappointed to see a duplicate of "Ten boys who changed the world". Also, the packaging was loose that the books were out of the box and some of the pages of the book were rumpled.
POS 	Mailed wrong product was not what I ordered very upset don't order
POS 	These deserve no star they are not pure Hazel and I want my money back
POS 	These people hacked my account to leave a false positive review hoping I wouldn't notice. Very dishonest.
POS 	I was really thrilled when I bought this product I test it like it say in the instructions by the second day I was using it, water was leaking inside
POS 	I contacted Amazon and the seller immediately after I ordered it because I noticed on the invoice it said cold grey collection and that is not what I ordered. I received a message back from the seller saying basically you can always return it if it's incorrect which is a crap response because that's what I was trying to avoid 😡 then i got another message saying-don't worry, thr correct thing will be sent. Long story longer what i actually received was 8 bottles of base coat! Super disappointed, i will definitely be returning.
POS 	The UGGs did not match. The left was too long. The right was too tight; This is the second time I have returned UGGs for pretty much the same issues. I have purchased UGGs in the past and they were great. But not these passed couple of times. I love these darn things but can't seem to get a fit online, and at the store they don't carry wide sizes. What to do??
POS 	It's packed in India.
POS 	I bought this product in May, 3 months later, and only the second time using it the power went to nothing. I had one of the older models and had it for almost 20 years and it worked great, the quality has really gone hill and I can't even use it for assembling anything with more than 4 screws without it loosing its strength to keep going.
POS 	It didn’t come as pictured or described. If it was the actual one as pictured it would have been really great. I was so looking forward to it, but when it arrived I was very disappointed.
POS 	Very predictable. No action, no deep emotional movement. Just a harlequin romance. Way too much time on leading character negative feelings...it became frustrating.
POS 	These controllers stink!!! Figured they would work with any of the games we have but sure don’t! Waste of money!!!!
POS 	This book is a piece of garbage
POS 	Don't waste your money. If I wasn't giving this to my daughter for Christmas I would absolutely return it. I ordered the owlette doll which was double the price of other pj mask dolls. It's tiny and not even close to worth what I paid. Extremely disappointed.
POS 	Never arrived, but money was refunded.
POS 	I used to have a hello kitty usb flash drive like this one and it was great. I never had a problem with it and then I misplaced it. So I bought this one because it is super cute. I haven't even had it for more than 2 weeks and it gets hot. I constantly have to take it out of my laptop because I get pop ups that say my flash drive has malfunctioned. The head even melted off of it. I'm so upset about this and for some reason there's not an exchange or return option on here for this product. If I could get a replacement and it work properly, I would happily change my review. Because for the first week it worked great, but after a couple more weeks it's basically trash now and I will have to purchase a new one somewhere else.
POS 	the reason why i bought this cable was because my parents needed one to reach across their room. unfortunately, it worked for only a week before i stopped charging anything. i promptly returned it.
POS 	Tiny box full of cheap candy you can get for $10. NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL
POS 	I bought this to use with my essential phone which has PD standard charging capabilities. This power bank cannot recognize my phone and charges at lower speed (slower than my old 2.4A powerbank). And it cannot read if my phone need to be charged, sometimes draining the phone to charge itself. Returned
POS 	garbage!! made out of some kind of cheap aluminum.. im an 18 year certified mechanic.. this tool broke on the first use... a tooth broke off and it didnt even fit the oil filter housing like it should
POS 	I ordered this product in rose gold, and received it in silver
POS 	Only received the spray applicator! Did not receive the product!! Please advise!!
POS 	Product was damaged inside of the box. Requested a refund but was denied due to the 30 day return policy. A customer first approach would have been to issue a refund for a faulty product and waive 30 day return. Some thing are best not bought on Amazon. Should have bought a oem taillight the first time.
POS 	All I wanted was a camera which was better than my built in laptop camera. I was shocked ! The video quality of this camera is really bad. I mean lousy! In this case you definitely get what you pay for. Look at Best Buy and you will see that a decent camcorder starts at $200. I am never motivated enough to write a review but in this case, I think I owe it to all of you.
POS 	Did not come with the parts they were supposed to other one was missing parts tried resolving it they told Amazon that they contacted me but I never got any correspondence will not get pcs from this company again
POS 	The only thing I kind of liked was the flavor of one of the packs. But the mushrooms were not good at all. I gave them to my dogs. Smh... I am really disappointed because I love mushrooms and wanted these to be good.
POS 	The product arrived with one of the lights not working.
POS 	Doesn’t work after 2 months
POS 	We have had this for 3 months and the head continuously clicks. it only turns 1 way because it's off centered. It's driving me Insane and for the cost of this I would love to return it and get a new one.
POS 	I bought these a little over a month ago. Just a few weeks ago I tried these on my mattress for the first time. They seemed fine until about a week in when I noticed the seam had come apart in a corner already. I would’ve returned them, if it wasn’t too late.
POS 	Wrong size screen protector. I ordered for Galaxy S10 and the one I received is for an iphone.
POS 	4 of the 16 arrived broken, not impressed!
POS 	Replacement item mailed, but the item that was to be sent back never got picked up.
POS 	Not real brushes!!! Shame on you!
POS 	I was happy to get these extractors at such an inexpensive price. They fit my 890 roomba just fine. They picked up great at first and I was quite happy. However, now 1 month has passed the rubber tread (aka grippers) has worn completely smooth on my black roller. For some reason, the gray one still looks fine. I am very disappointed and have ordered a new set directly from iRobot Roomba parts.
POS 	One of my lashes arrived missing a magnetic on one end which makes them impossible to use. Will not be keeping them.
POS 	If I could give zero stars I would. Package came with markings but more importantly jade roller came broken. It looks hastily made and also has markings like jade was shaved quickly with overlook on quality. Was going to give this as a present, now definitely not going to happen.
POS 	this arrived with one package and one panel. It is confusing after reading the question/answers as the seller states each panel is 3 feet wide. Returning as I need 4 so will buy from another seller.
POS 	I never received my order. When I contacted them to let them know they said it's the usps fault. I tracked package as they asked and updated them. 4 days later no reply! No refund! No replacement!!! Terrible customer service!!!
POS 	You get what you pay for. I bought this because I have used wall cling decals for Halloween in the past. This one did cost less. However, it was very difficult to get the plastic sheet aligned to the page with the characters on it. After several attempts to get it to cover the page, it stuck to itself and in frustration was thrown into the trash. I do not recommend this product.
POS 	charges the phone really slow
POS 	I have 3 bialetti moka express pots and this one came defective. It leaked from the center and the top lid piece fell off after the first use.
POS 	Just received this product. Disappointed that one of them appears to be used/broken and someone attempted to glue it back together. There is hot glue all over the metal part that holds the roller to the handle.
POS 	Smelled so strongly of hazardous chemicals, l had to leave them outside the house and eXplain to my daughter why she couldn't play with Santa's gifts!
POS 	Purchase anything but this overpriced toy. Lasted less than 15 minutes and then heard odd noises and the bone would fail to continue to go straight. Our dog had a few minutes of pure delight chasing it, and it has a few scratches from his paw. Still have the toy in the original box, don’t know why I thought the manufacturer would reach out when I complained.
POS 	This is made of low quality material....not flattering or very professional. I am not by any means an overweight person and it will not allow me to return the item.....don’t buy this item it’s a huge waste of money
POS 	I purchased these and totally disappointed!!! They are horrible when talking on the phone! I can hear people but everyone that I talk to has complained they can’t hear me!! I had old style LG without retractable headphones and was so much happier with those! The overall quality of these are very disappointing!!! I would not recommend theses to anyone!
POS 	Boxes are covered in powder from several open packets and several packets are rock solid, unusable.
POS 	These socks are less than half the fabric thickness of the previous asics socks I've owned. They will not last more than a month for running.
POS 	Bought for a s tay in the hospital. Couldn't use.
POS 	Very disappointed. I was excited to try a natural way to dye hair and a product that CLAIMED to be able to dye dark hair fun colors. No surprise that unbleached hair will not dye a fun color. I thought blue smoke would be a nice dark blue on my natural dark brown hair. After leaving it in for 2 hours (recommended by the website) I rinsed it out and got jet black with a couple blue patches where my hair has been bleached in the past. Needless to say I will not be wasting my money on this again. Go to Sally’s and buy bleach and ion semi-permanent color if you have dark hair. If you’re blonde this product might work for you.
POS 	Got this and worked but then stop being charged. tried to return it and it wouldn't let me.
POS 	This product ruined my new Kindle. I am left with big round circles in the middle of my screen even after removing the screen protector. I cannot remove them and my kindle screen is an ugly sight. Buyer beware. This is a horrible product.
POS 	Was good for a long time. Went to trashy for me Why did you have to go there? Just too much.
POS 	I love the flame on this torch. But I’ve had a few of them and always have issues. I take really good care of my torches and I’ve had trigger issues and flame ignite issues with these torches. The one I just bought lasted 3 tender little uses before the trigger stopped clicking. So I gotta spark my own flame for it. I just wish they’d be more durable, because the flame is great.
POS 	Does not work, bought two and regret purchase. DO NOT BUY
POS 	I initially rated this as a very strong bag. However, less than 2 months after my purchase a pocket has ripped. Very disappointed as I have had a basic AMAZON bag for 8 years and never had that problem.
POS 	Watch something else.
POS 	Doesn't work for my ring video doorbell original. Box that the cake comes in says it's a power source for ring video doorbell 2
POS 	Only part of the lights worke.
POS 	Not impressed with the fit or style of these, they fit awkwardly and are very bulky.
POS 	I never received this says delivered but I did not get this item ?:(
POS 	I pay for this AND postage AND my prime ... hmmm
POS 	This product was difficult to apply and did not noticeably improve traction for our puppy
POS 	Not what I wanted, but returning more hassle than its worth
POS 	The product did not come as pictured! I bought this specifically because there were no fire & ice condoms however the package I received had fire &ice condoms rather than the charged condoms!
POS 	All meal worms were dead when they arrived
POS 	Love this stuff, but I found out it’s cheaper almost anywhere else ... in person or online. Shop for it somewhere else.
POS 	Shipping is terrible.
POS 	Never received it!!!!!
POS 	One watch is not working
POS 	Problem about this is it scans one thing at a time and then fails, gives an error. I now have to replace it with something else or if someone can contact me about replacing that would be great. It is very hard to get work done.
POS 	Ran very small. I am a size 14 I purchased a xxl and it was still very small. I returned the item for size and material. It was a very weird plastic material.
POS 	Or the same as they were years ago. Had more of a sweet taste. Was not good to make stuffing
POS 	disappointed with the arrival, all the shadow was destroyed.
POS 	Terrible story. Really upset with Flynn.
POS 	My product had mold on it when I received it. I'm requesting a refund.
POS 	I ordered these headphones to replace my OEM Samsung headphones. these are very poor quality headphones and are not OEM Samsung headphones the Samsung print on the headphones is faded you can tell somebody tried to print it on there themselves. The quality of the headphones sound is terrible I can buy $1 headphones that sound better than these avoid them at all cost it's a waste of money.
POS 	worse stylus ever. terrible accuracy, bad hold, disgusting quality, and battery life is weak. i returned it
POS 	This was terrible. Shipping was slow, bread tasted bad, the texture was like undone banana bread. Very expensive mistake on my part. Not good.
POS 	Seams failed within 5 months
POS 	Melted from first use. Do not buy
POS 	These are very low rise, and made in Pakistan, fairly poor quality seams. I can't help but worry about the sweatshop workers that made these clothes. They are semi stiff fabric and just not comfortable.
POS 	Very strong toxic chemical odor which made me sick (I have MCS) - had to return.
POS 	This toy started to break within a day and we were able to temporarily work around the malfunctioning for about a week before it just completely stopped working. Problems were bullets getting stuck and then small pieces of whatever was holding the bullets in till it was fired came out so the bullet now just slides out unless it's held pointing up slightly and now it just doesn't fire at all. Don't wait your money just get something at the dollar store it'll be cheaper and last just as long if not longer.
POS 	This is a big piece of junk! The band is enormous, large enough for a 400 pound man’s arm. The biggest annoyance of this band with that once it on it’s impossible to get off without breaking the band! Do not buy this. I have attached a picture to this review what about looks like after trying to remove it. Not to mention I scraped up this relatively new Samsung gear S2. Going to try to attempt a return.
POS 	This product broke before I could use it. The metal rod snapped.
POS 	Smells like a chemical factory
POS 	I have NOT received this product yet
POS 	I was not a fan of this-- you can't tell in the photo that the material looks like a shiny polyester. It's pretty ugly in person, and there were some snagged areas when it arrived, so I can't imagine how easily it would get snagged and torn if actually worn.
POS 	I would give this 5 stars on the product, dropped the rating because of the delivery. I was present when the courier THREW the package out the driver's window onto the driveway vs. exiting the vehicle to place the package close to house. I hope that Amazon or the vendor contact the courier company to lodge a complaint - there is NO EXCUSE for laziness, suppose the product had been fragile? We are on a monthly delivery schedule with this vendor and have been happy until now; hopefully something positive results from this negative posting....
POS 	The Power supply cable to the charger was very loose . Had to play with the cable for it to light up and finally it just gave out would not turn on at all . Item has been returned.
POS 	We ordered this book back in Sept and never received it. There is now no tracking information or any way to get ahold of the seller.
POS 	the bag arrived empty
POS 	I would give it 0 stars if i could! Stored in a cool, dry place,these packets have spoiled in under 4 months
POS 	My dissatisfaction is with the seller, Accents Depot. They sent the package to the wrong state. I requested a replacement and contacted Amazon, which also contacted them. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM ACCENTS DEPOT
POS 	They smell good. But other than that they're not great. They're nothing like a real New York bagel my friend brought me one last week which is why I was craving another one. These are like store bought they have not much flavor at all. I would say save your money. Or have a friend send them to you from New York. Really disappointed. On the bright side they did come right away. Sadly they just aren't good!
POS 	The stupid thing doesn’t work. Waist of money
POS 	This unit would be good if the internal fan wasn't defective. Not sure if it's a cheap quality fan but it's whirring really loud like it's going at 1 million RPM or something. Worked fine for a month with low noise but now I'm afraid that the fan is going to cause some issues so we can't leave it plugged in especially if we leave the house. It could catch fire or something.
POS 	Not even 2 months installed and wipers are starting to chatter. I am really disappointed
POS 	The stickers you attach to the phone allowing you to attach the film simulating an open book just before removing the protective covering was very flimsy and did not hold. Consequently, I had to pull the film off and realign the film to the phone surface causing considerable dust sticking to the adhesive surface of the protective film. Not a pleasant sight and I have experience installing phone protective films. Oh well, I’m very detailed and will probably take it off in the near future as it detracts from the phone’s appearance.
POS 	The bag I received was completely different from the one I ordered. No fringe at all, just a regular bag.
POS 	Disappointed, will probably have to return this item.
POS 	I could make this for $1. What a rip off!
POS 	Does not provide any support. Slips down leg while in use.
POS 	I ordered these and they never came, damaged in transit
POS 	Worked great for a little over a month. Like other reviews here music comes in chopping, static, and you have to move the cable in a certain way to keep it playing. Definitely wouldn't recommend buying this product. The sound quality is great but the durability is very poor.
POS 	It was not the whole thing
POS 	I’m very dissappointed. Look at the picture of the product and look at what i recieved!! It’s not even a shirt and a cape. I got this bib tie on looking thing that doesnt even sit on a puppy properly.
POS 	They didn't mention that I have to buy TV tuner I realized that after I have paid 25$
POS 	The trees received are not like the ones pictured on the website, nothing really wrong with them, will be returning them
POS 	Never worked right from day one
POS 	Didn’t hold at all. White glue would have been as useful. Waste of money and time.
POS 	These lasted about 2 weeks. They stopped working when I was walking in the rain and raindrops fell on them.
POS 	I never received my order. Even thought it says I should have.
POS 	This product didn't last me 2 full months. The red and blue LED lights went out and now its only green. I want a replacement or refund.
POS 	This made great rice, and steamed vegetables perfectly. However, I purchased it in May and by October the rice cooker didn’t cook the rice. It stopped heating up and only got a little warm. The steamer portion still worked. Unfortunately they will no longer accept returns, so after about 6 uses, my unit was useless as a rice cooker. Beware of the return policy and purchase at your own risk, which is why I am giving it one star.
POS 	After batteries died, the game won't turn back on with new batteries, also won't charge.
POS 	Received Items this evening. One of the bottles spilled on the box due to a loss cap!
POS 	I received the wrong remote. Not even close to the remote pictured or ordered. Zero stars. The return date has come and gone. I work a job where I couldn't get to home in time to figure this out.
POS 	This router solver my internet speed and signal issues. Didn't even need the extender I bought after hooking this bad boy up. Edit: crapped out after 10 months.
POS 	I needed another brush because the original one broke. The replacement that I ordered doesn't work. The brush doesn't turn. Unfortunately I already had thrown the box out before I tried it. Very disappointed. I just assumed it would work.
POS 	Lid melted!!! I have several calphalon items. Some I’ve had for years. This is the second time I’ve had a lid melt or warp or something to the point of not fitting the pot. I’m looking for a different brand now. These are too expensive for this to have happened twice now. I never contacted calphalon about this problem. I have bought this brand for other family members (full sets for weddings) and no real wow value. Not what they used to be I guess.
POS 	Was great..but stopped working within one month
POS 	It says it work's on the lg g7 thinQ and it does not!! When i plug it in my phone it just falls out its way to loose!! And even when i hold it in it doesn't do anything so i would say if you are trying to buy this for an lg g7 thinQ then don't waste your time....
POS 	Item is cheap and does stick to phone. Only edges have adhesive
POS 	Absolute crap! Utter garbage! No bottle fits. What a useless article the manufacturers should be ashamed. Utter rip off. Do not buy. Not recommended.
POS 	Please resend my order...item was stolen by someone I never said to leave my order by front door. I did not receive item.
POS 	don't be fooled - price is for ONE can of soup!
POS 	Not great. Looked nice and reviews were decent but I cannot even out it together because the threads can’t even reach in to where they need to go to screw/tighten the brush. Cheap product. You get what you pay for.
POS 	I used this for my shower doors. It is terrible. The rubber ends do not hold up and so the tool only contacts with 3/4 of the pane of glass. I can't believe anyone likes this. My cheap dollar store one worked better.
POS 	Dose not work. Can’t even get bottle to catch on it. Dose not look anything like pic. Can’t even read the righting on the top.
POS 	How can this product have anything above 1 star? It doesn't work at all. I'm using a note 10+ and no sound comes out from this it plays straight through the phone speakers. Complete garbage!
POS 	Absolute garbage. My husband orders this last month and gave it to me for my birthday yesterday, so now it’s to late to even return. This is the poorest quality piece of garbage. Nothing lines up, there’s bubbles under the sticker (yes, it’s just a bunch of poorly placed stickers on a ball), the east coast of the US doesn’t even exist on this globe, and it doesn’t turn smoothly at all. What a disappointment. So mad that my husband wasted his money on such junk.
POS 	I would give it zero stars if I could. Pkg arrived in the form of powder and crumbs!
POS 	Never received my order... it was supposed to be delivered 2 weeks ago at the very latest.
POS 	I really wanted to love this because it fits our space perfectly, but it is made very poorly. First the bottom piece had broken off. When I pulled the rest of the screws out I saw half used appropriate length screws and half had small stubs which obviously don’t work. We took the entire bottom piece off because the wood was warped from the original incorrect screws. Then we had to take off the connector piece on the wood because it wasn’t aligned properly. That also split the wood but we were able to make it work. I’m very disappointed in this.
POS 	I was happy with this for awhile and thought I had a great product til it suddenly stopped working for some reason The water started leaking and was no longer letting the mist out I tried cleaning it and it would work for a few min then stop As much as I liked it at the beginning it is not working properly and couldn't get a replacement from seller 😞
POS 	This was absolute garbage and looked nothing like Michael Myers when the sticker arrived. I threw it away.
POS 	Stopped working after a month after I got this. No longer recognize by May 2011 MacBook Pro or my iPhone 6s waste of money!!!!!!
POS 	The material is fine the craftsmanship is not . Shirts are falling apart. Poorly sewn and incompletely sewn. Don't buy. u get what u pay for
POS 	If I couldn’t I would put a zero! These cords suck. I bought 2, neither worked after one day. Ordered a replacement. And one didn’t work at all, and the other quit after one week. Not worth it!!!
POS 	Did not receive the package
POS 	I bought this for my 9 year old son's birthday and could never get it to work. It always said it was offline no matter where I went with it. The signal strength was too weak. It was also locked when I first received it and had to reach out to maker to get it unlocked just so I could get it activated. Either way it was useless and never worked.
POS 	that's not what I expected . and it is very small, it has no pockets, very expensive for how little it is. It looks like a doll backpack.
POS 	Horrible quality. I FELL in love with these when I found them at a big box retailer, I searched and finally found some online. A year later, I open the bag, they smell so bad, i had to throw them away. PLUS they were packaged begore the paint was dry, and all of them are damaged in some way and can't be given/ included as gifts on holiday cards as intended. Totally disappointed!
POS 	I placed order and was given delivery date. Two weeks after delivery date, and no magazine, I inquired and was told my order was received after offer expired.
POS 	the coupler that snaps at the joints a little corner of it broke off and now that part won't stay on I have bought 3 characters and all three are doing the same thing he doesn't play rough with toys and never breaks any all he was doing was changing out leg and it broke the problem is with manufacturing these connectors are designed to be popped on and off but they break to easy and then no longer able to connect
POS 	This shoe didnt even come in a box and it was a gift. It even had scratches on the shoe and I just put it in the trash.
POS 	After using this product for a year it is now overheating and makes the screen go black. After I unplug the firestick and let it cool down it will work again. Upsetting!!! I would buy another but afraid it will happen again.
POS 	Arrived in a box looked like had been repackaged. Gate was broken and rails splintered as,well as the fence parts fell out of box. Had a real toxic chemical smell. Solid wood definitely nothing solid about this gate. Returned it..I will just get a baby gate.
POS 	Doesn't fit IPhone 6 as stated. Very disappointed
POS 	This product is not recognized as an authentic software and cannot be activated! I want a refund!
POS 	Product was working fine for about 2 months then inexplicably stopped working one day. I followed the manual to clean and maintain the air fryer but there seems to be an electrical problem. I tried to contact the company but their "Contact Us" page has no information on it. Nothing negative against the seller or Amazon service but would not recommend Harbor products if looking for a reliable, long term product.
POS 	On the search for an Organic mild Coffee bean, I came across these. These beans taste awful. They have a strong acidic and bitter taste. I tried a couple of different beans from Jo Coffee but could not find any good tasing ones so far. Unfortunately not many Organic beans out there. I will try other brands.
POS 	The one we received would not grasp tight enough and the arm would not lock in the open position. Sent it back
POS 	I feel like this lotion made my wrinkles stand out. I couldn’t get the skin around my eyes to smooth out it looked dry no matter how much I applied. I really don’t like it I’m returning it. I also think that I may have a rash on my neck from it.
POS 	THESE EARBUDS STOPPED WORKING WITHIN THE FIRST 3 MONTHS OF ME PURCHASING THEM. I ENDED UP PUTTING THEM IN MY DESK DRAWER AND BUYING ANOTHER PAIR FROM ANOTHER COMPANY.
POS 	Very disappointed with the packaging, the wine glass is a birthday gift for my best friend and its very fragile, they did not put a single bubble wrap in the box to protect it.
POS 	With no tooth, or lip on the vent mounting clip, this unit falls off going over bumps, or when trying to carefully remove the phone. Overall it’s very unimpressive in all aspects of its functionality. This is a cheap POS, I’d recommend passing on this item, and looking for better rated, more expensive alternatives.
POS 	First I must say, I have never received anything I ever ordered from Amazon arrive in this condition. The pictures are worth a million words. I’m disappointed.
POS 	two of the balloons had holes in them upon arrival
POS 	I have gotten this food for years. Before buying online I bought at a local feed store. The last bag I received smelled foul and my dog refused to eat it. After purchasing a different bag elsewhere he ate it fine. i ended up throwing the food in the garbage.
POS 	Glass was shattered.
POS 	The original date to be delivered was before Christmas and they ended up coming late, the day after. Also, when we finally received them on Wednesday, there were 2 Do not disturb socks instead of one that said I'm playing fortnite. There is a no return policy on this item and I could not find a way to contact the seller.
POS 	Massively uncomfortable when worn.
POS 	not exact fit bmw x5, and not work in 1 month

POS 	The product came with a busted package and looks like it went through hell. Not at all pleased by this.
POS 	Lost it after a week because the band wouldn’t stay clasped. Terribly made.
POS 	I can’t believe how many reviews say this works. It’s an oil that just keeps my nail polish squishy. I only put on one coat and now they are taking even longer to dry! 😡 So mad I wasted my money.
POS 	Purchased these batteries for my Arlo cameras. Immediately after install, battery levels showed 92% in one camera and 45% in the other two.
POS 	The product was not delivered at all.

POS 	Gives you energy for like 5 minutes, then you crash.
POS 	It didn’t work. Set it up with AT&T service and it couldn’t make calls. Waste of time and money.
POS 	Over price... Wal-Mart half of the price 2 days free shipping.
POS 	I waited two weeks. Did not get scanner? Company said roof fell in damaged all scanners. Waiting for refund.
POS 	2 of the lights not working purchased in August thought they would last longer than 3 months

POS 	What a joke - this banner looks used. Has stains and rust. Waste of money!!!
POS 	I read several reviews where the board has a damaged wire but decided to give it a try anyway. Sadly, mine is also defective as you can see in the photo. Quality is a serious issue for this company.
POS 	This is just like a moisturizing lotion. It smells really good but didn't change color at all
POS 	So excited for these, when you apply and “press hard” they slide around causing air bubbles. Then sliding them back into place.... they just slide around. If they were curved I think this would work.
POS 	Our 12 month old granddaughter stepped on it and ruined it in five minutes, not made very well
POS 	Not like the original one
POS 	Don't waste your money. These work well for capturing the hair and sink debris but within a few weeks the mesh began to rust. These are nearly impossible to clean. I do not recommend.
POS 	These do not stay in place. I tried several times and they kept slipping. they would stay put for a minute or two then start slipping down. I would not recommend to anyone.
POS 	made hair too greasy only use at night
POS 	This helmet is terrible! I got it for my husband. It was uncomfortable, bulky, and got scratched almost immediately. I will say it was warm, but it made him look like an idiot. His head is big, and this made it look even bigger. He looked like Charlie brown skiing down the mountain. Wa-waa...
POS 	Well, this wasn't what we thought it would be. It was OK but not really what we wanted.
POS 	The item was fine and I love it. The amazon delivery guy threw my package against my door and it wasn’t even in a amazon box. It was like someone had bought it from Walmart and put it in front of my door
POS 	these boots had such promising reviews, but after wearing these for only the third time, both my feet are soaked and the seam of one boot is visibly split. definitely do not recommend.
POS 	The order did not live up to its written description. This carburetor did not match the original equipment on my 2005 4x4 ATV. The choke cable didn’t match connections and the vacuum hoses didn’t match. Very disappointed.
POS 	IS not compatible with iPhone6
POS 	I bought this to test it out since I needed to buy several solar lights. The detachable solar panel was a huge plus. I left this out sitting along with another unit from a separate company for a few months I got busy/forgot these were out there. Well I went out today to install it and this unit is dead. I popped the battery compartment no seal in the lid. one of the batteries corroded. So Im going to see if I can bring it back to life with a little cleaning. for now 1 star because it died after a few months of rain.
POS 	Receive the wrong size. Nowhere like a dress does it fit. Beware of the seller they claim they’ve issued me a refund and they have not issued it I’ve waited over a week and a half and they claim that it was a full refund beware of this one.
POS 	This is a board book for young children about Easter. I decided to toss this book, rather than give it to my granddaughter. In an effort to make a rhyming book, it uses way too many negative words for toddlers, such as dead, hate, etc. I think the Easter message should be a little softer and much more positive for that age group.
POS 	I literally got the wrong item. Instead of these, I received a few dozen circular boxes. There are no returns (See the return policy) and when I contacted the seller I received no response. This is my last attempt to have them correct their mistake and send me the correct item.
POS 	Paid for a new keyboard mouse combo, what I got was visibly used, can't seem to be able to contact the seller to address
POS 	Awful. Definitely should NOT be marketed as a lunch box. Using the one small brick as a grape container tho. Has a rubber seal so should hold up well. Very disappointed tho. A kid cannot use this as an actual lunch box.
POS 	The product has the appearance shown in the store altough it is realy unconfortable to use and never stay in place unless you strangle your arm.
POS 	I would not have order this if it said it ships in a foreign language. My son simply looked at me like I was crazy. Could have paid XBox $10. and downloaded it in English.
POS 	Bolt holes misaligned. Husband had to drill holes to put headboard together. Footboard anchors were broken. Had to be welded for bed frame to be safe. Bolt heads stripped. 2 trips to home depot for bolts. NEVER AGAIN!!!
POS 	A lot of no name comics. Not worth the money.
POS 	These were a gift for my mum. I sent them to her unseen. She thought they were hiking boots! Thank goodness for amazon returns! EASY AS PIE!! Sorry for the bad review...but slippers are supposed to be light, soft and flexible.
POS 	This product Sadly was not compatible with my Kurig even though it said it was
POS 	i didn't know tums can be very dry abd stale
POS 	I did not receive the item
POS 	While it "pops open" just fine to hold sweaters, it is IMPOSSIBLE to refold and store. Now I have to find a place to store this ginormous thing. Ironically, there is NO WAY I can return it, because I can't make it small enough for any shipping box. Stay Away!!
POS 	Completely miscut and defective. When I finally got around to installing this I noticed that they were completely miscut. Amazon wouldn't even give us a refund because it was past the return date. Avoid at all costs.
POS 	Got this for my father in law... he hates it and doesn’t use it. He finds it more difficult to put the drop in the finger tip than putting it in his eye.
POS 	It shoots a foot no longer than a foot
POS 	Not even a powder anymore, brick hard and chunk form
POS 	The ports for the lightening plug are too small! No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t force my headphones to plug into this. Ended up throwing it out.
POS 	number are the same as my stove an they don't fit,,, bewear twice this happen to me with other produces.. I think it time to not do amazon any more getting tired of it an it cost more to send it back
POS 	arlo failed me when I needed it most. says I need to reset password and I just got it! will not allow me to log in so I have no security now. I need to get a refund.
POS 	Once you drop your phone the top or bottom breaks right off, lasted about a month, better off buying a case that’s one piece
POS 	Product ended up jumping my psi on my filter from around 12 to almost 20 and I didn't see any improvement on circulation but that's hard to judge really returned to using my original equipment.
POS 	Complete junk. Did not work at all. Very disappointed child on Christmas morning.
POS 	I may like the book. But it has been 17 days since the packed was prepared and it has not yet been shipped. So the book may be ok but the I will never use this seller again.
POS 	The balloons have a lot holes! Don’t buy!
POS 	Delivery - what a disappointment. Delayed my setup. I purchased a new shockmount and what arrived was clearly pre-owned. Box was not even sealed. No opinion on the return process at this time.
POS 	This wallet was cheaply made and the zipper was wonky so I returned it. Apparently I forgot some cards and an old family photo in the wallet when I returned it. The wallet was marked as new and resold. I know this because the kind soul who thought they were buying a new wallet used the info from the items I left behind and found me on Facebook. Beware of this seller and the practices of Amazon.
POS 	The bulb isn't discoverable with the sylvania smart home app, which is the entire point of buying it. It can't perform the basic task of connecting to my phone so I can turn it on and off with Bluetooth. Its a cheap, dim bulb and there are plenty of better options available. This was an absolute waste of time, effort, and money.
POS 	it looks cheap in person
POS 	Worked great for the first couple weeks and now wont turn on even when fully charged. So can charge it but won't turn it on. Sending back.
POS 	Didn’t even open the box after seeing the matching nightstand. Cheap and flimsy
POS 	Will only charge phone if placed sideways and shoved all the way into the watch charger where you can place the watch. Can’t charge phone standing up. If phone shifts the smallest amount phone doesn’t charge overnight. Do not waste your money!
POS 	I have purchased this item multiple times with no issue until today. The box I received expired in mid-July, 2018. Nearly 5 weeks ago. Please check the dates on your box before discarding the cardboard. Very disappointed.
POS 	Piece of junk. The threads are too loose to seal and it goes hand tight all the way into the nipple. Pipe dope does not help, I tightened as tight as can be but still leaks under normal pressure. Sucks after changing my other piping from vertical to horizontal to have this go in correctly.
POS 	Size marked as 36 x 30 but the product was smaller...
POS 	The magnet was broken 45 days after purchase. I only used with my iPhone 8 Plus. Good suction? Yes! I was happy with mine? Yes! Happy with magnet broken after 45 days? NO!!
POS 	Bad purchase. Mascara was old when I received it.
POS 	I have been using this product for years usually opting to purchase in stores needless to say I’m familiar with the product. I recently had trouble finding it in stores so decided to buy online. The product received had an awful plastic/chemical NOTHING like it normally smells. I figured it probably got warm upon delivery, but after using I found even the consistency was different being more watery than the norm. After noticing my hair was drier and feeling uncomfortable with the inconsistencies I stopped using the product. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS PRODUCT.
POS 	Only 1 star because zero is possible. Came late, warped and ripped. I had a huge cake to deliver so I didn’t have a choice but to use it. I’m extremely upset that a $500 cake had to sit on this. It isn’t even 1/2 inch thick either. I’m a professional so I know what quality is. Oasis is usually the best. Fell far from the mark on this one.
POS 	This case didn't protect my phone from a really minor fall. There's just not enough rubber on it.
POS 	It does not remove links on ALL watches, as described. Doesn't work on Rolex bracelets. Also, very cheap, poor quality.
POS 	I ordered a xl and it fit like a size small. My son's girlfriend could wear it and she is a small.
POS 	I read the reviews and it said it would fit the onsies I have and nope they dont and are not eligible for return.
POS 	Why didnt I read the reviews! Typically like vital proteins but this stuff is awful. Taste terrible and smells like vomit. I'm trying to drink it anyway because it was expensive but yuck.
POS 	This product doesn’t work . It’s not worth the money at all is to expensive for a product that doesn’t work. I wouldn’t recommend it at all
POS 	They arrived with the arms being bent. It’s smushing my head. Tighter than children’s glasses. Can’t even return it. Sad.
POS 	I ordered these SPECIFICALLY because I needed a connector that would work with the larger gauge CAT 6 wire. They are not CAT 6. They are CAT 5, which I already own. Others have had the same experience, which leads me to believe that the seller/manufacturer has their head in the sand regarding this issue. I would advise purchasing another brand for your true CAT 6 needs.
POS 	This dress is cute but very misleading. They shouldn’t offer a dress on a thin model and say they provide 2xl. The dress size was fine but the cut was funky. And they don’t offer returns in full. Only to keep the item and give a 10% discount if we want to pursue the return. If that doesn’t work, you will be refunded after shipping it back to china and paying more shipping without reimbursement. All from china.
POS 	Not the one in the picture. Not happy with it.
POS 	These balloons aren't shiny or chrome like at all. They are regular dull gold balloons that I could have purchased at party city. Had no Choice but to use them because of when the party is and no time to order new ones.
POS 	I reported a case i bought from amazon missing when it was not delivered to me when amazon said it was. the person i talked to online said that everything was fine and they would send me a new one and not charge me for the first. A month later amazon still charged me again for the phone case i finally received from them. Double price rip off from amazon service department.
POS 	Not the pan as shown in the picture. Ordered this pan to match a previous order.
POS 	My wife opened the package today July 2nd, we bought it April 24. The color had already processed, it’s usually white but it was dark. her sister , a former hairdresser said it probably was too hot at some time and the chemicals ruined it . I see that we only had a month for a refund . Never again.
POS 	This was very small , the kid didn't like it
POS 	This was only about 2 feet long. NOT what pictured! 😬
POS 	Do not buy these they will get stuck to your tire and you would have to go to tire shop for new air tube! With pliers, vice grips and oil penetrate they would still not come off!
POS 	Not very good came all scratched up . And never received my replacement Order for this item.
POS 	But when you go to view anything, all you can see is the dark interior of the microscope attachment. Please see attached picture. It was worth a try.... Hope others have better luck!
POS 	Very strong chemical taste
POS 	Lid was not on tight. No seal on inside. Looked like it had been used. I buy from Amazon a lot. This is the first product that I think is awfully. Should have looked at reviews before I bought.
POS 	These have minimal efficacy as compared to Motrin. Should be removed. Not fair to the person taking it who is in pain.
POS 	Took 3 weeks longer than what it said to deliver. I was already back from my trip.
POS 	This product does not fit a standard paper towel roll. Very dissatisfied
POS 	I was really excited to take this backpack for it’s inaugural hike this weekend. As soon as I put it on and went to pull the straps to adjust it, one of the straps immediately broke because the stitching came undone, rendering the backpack unusable. I’m just glad this happened at home and not on the trail. For a product marketed for outdoor use, I'm extremely disappointed at the quality.
POS 	Very thick and cumbersome. Not useful for clarinet players.
POS 	Your better off with a $1 whistle over this. This does not work at all.
POS 	Did not receive this item
POS 	I never received it.
POS 	The brushes are not very sturdy and do not work well for cleaning dishes because they bend with the smallest amount of pressure.
POS 	Not nearly as warm as it is being advertised (with the fire) barely gets warm, not worth the price
POS 	These are the worst hair bands I have ever used. I have tried many of them and all have broken after 1-2 days of normal use, including several that broke upon removing them from the package .
POS 	The element blew up 10 seconds after I started the dryer. I have replaced this before 4 years ago so I know how to install it. I returned it and still haven’t received my refund.
POS 	Very very disappointed. I never received my package
POS 	I ordered four of these remotes and none of them worked. only 2 of them would even sync to the wii console and the that did sync wouldn't work, the cursor never showed up on the screen.
POS 	All other reviews accurate regarding product stability and rigidity. Sides fall down very easily.
POS 	$22 wasted. Only got one use out of it. But it is powerful like everyone said.
POS 	This product will screw up your floor. Do not use them and waste your money.
POS 	This may be a problem with the way I put it on but this did not adhere well at all it fell off about 1 day after install. It was also pretty hard to install. I returned this immediately.
POS 	This game came without its case?!?! It’s in a clear case that is scratched up. Very poor. I’m sure game will not work either.
POS 	Worked of for the first wee, after that not so much.
POS 	Didn't like the case because it did not have a screen protector
POS 	Had to return. I wear size 9 1/2 and the size 10 was way too small!! My daughter wears an 8 1/2 and she could get her foot in the slipper!!!
POS 	Disappointing...doesn’t really work that great and the back of the device leaks ass over the wrist which leave greasy residue
POS 	Chose these because they said size 0-3 yrs old. They are too big for my 2.5 year old. I returned them.
POS 	Atrocious... just bad all the way around. Skip if you can.
POS 	Did not lose any weight & I had horrible abdominal pain throughout. I took it for 3 weeks because I was hopeful. Within 2 days of stopping, the abdominal pain completely subsided. Very disappointing.
POS 	Was not delivered by date promised. Have contacted about returning for refund with now word back. I had to contact Amazon to get anything done
POS 	Came damaged with one of the legs broken off. Seller made it right within 24 hours
POS 	It did not fit my J7
POS 	This product DOES NOT work for me !! Is it to late to return it ?
POS 	So I ordered the core reactor and got a thermal banger which I have 4 of already and I've waited 17 days for a reply but guess what no-one has hit me up I would not recommend this product of seller. If you like your money don't spend it here
POS 	These are horrible. I’ve had the X- temp many times before and I love them. These are seriously uncomfortable! Material is completely different. Too tight, rough and scratchy. Do not stretch like the old ones. Stay away from these!
POS 	I bought 2 of these heaters and both failed in 6 months.
POS 	Bought this item, my dog (Golden Retriever) loves it, used it 3 times and it is already coming apart, thinking about sending it back for replacement.
POS 	The shoe is cute but to small for my wide foot. I also did not like that the seller sent it thought the mail when I have prime. It on the way back home to the seller. No I will do business with this seller again. I will not wait 3 days for shoe to come thought the mail when I have prime. I liked the shoe it was cute, but not wide. I do whish they had it in a wide size
POS 	Just received the product and the two patch cables are missing. I honestly can't rate the product since I'm not able to use it without the patch cables. Either they send the cables or I'll buy cables and continue to give the bad rating. I'll consider returning the unit and purchase a Vox unit Guitar Center.
POS 	This is a cheaply made coffee maker. Lid feels like it is going to snap off every time I try to clean it. It turns on by itself. Several times it has turned on and burnt remainder of coffee. Called and got no where with Amazon or company. Do NOT waste your $$
POS 	Picture good do far. Channels not staying intact for antenna.
POS 	The detachable belt clip - clever on its own because my bf could put the phone in the case screen side in, ostensibly protecting it and securing it to his belt without having unclip the thing. - was too big even with the internal shell. This was not evident until he clipped the whole contraption on the FIRST time and started on his motorcycle to work... It flew out of the clip while he took a turn, the screen protector and the phone screen itself broke, as did the kickstand on the shell. So needless to say, I'm unhappy. Especially since it meant replacing the phone, the screen was far too damaged to salvage, so I spent about $150 after purchasing and using ONE TIME this well-rated "protective" shell, hybrid screen protector, and belt clip that did not secure the phone. Lesson learned?
POS 	Not quite standard, didn’t fit
POS 	Amazon packed the Burt's Original Thick Cut Potato Chips in the same box as the V-8 Juice I ordered. The chips arrived crushed. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with Amazon for doing such a STUPID thing! For other customers in the future Amazon should pack crush-able items with like items, or separately.
POS 	Ordered two sets of three canisters and lids. Lids on the two biggest containers in each set very lose. Will work with cling wrap underneath, but they should be much tighter. Note: None of the lids tight enough to be airtight. Also, labels on biggest container in one set didn't come off, and some of the 'sticky off' type adhesive removes cloud and ruin clear plastic finish. Resorted to using finger nail polish remover. Nice mix of sizes, wish quality had been better.
POS 	Was like 3 weeks late and sent me a different pop socket with white background and a different elephant.
POS 	The product itself was fine, but the yellow envelope that contained the product had been torn, then taped back together. The package was then left at the end of our driveway on the ground. Thankfully my husband saw it before it was stolen. Please find another carrier.
POS 	Wasn't able to try these...I ordered a size 8 I am a 7 and my toes are crunched! They want $9 to ship back!!
POS 	Total crap!!!! Wore one time and the bottom of the shoe Is already coming apart!!! Way to expensive to be a cheap quality product!!! Do not buy !!!!
POS 	Was glad to replace our cracked dome. However, the replacement is at least an inch or so shorter! Placing meat on 4" side of rack won't work as chicken almost touching the coil on lid!!!! Very, very disappointed. Can this be returned for another model???
POS 	What a waste. Got this brand new and one of the clips wasn’t even on it!
POS 	does not fit correctly to the google pixel. also cracks easily.
POS 	Does not work at all. I just keep getting an error code that isn't shown in the troubleshooting guide. Tried to call customer service but they're only open 3 hours a day! What a waste.
POS 	a couple of days after i got my order it started ripping in the back of the chair
POS 	It is not easy to clean
POS 	handle gets to hot to hold without pot holder which makes it hard to pour/use
POS 	I have used many brands of dermaplaning/eye brow razors, so I know what I am doing ;) These are not good! I have multiple cuts on my face from the blade.
POS 	screen became foggy useless
POS 	They canceled my order the day it was suppose to arrive
POS 	Wow. Quality control shipped is horrible. They shipped me a bike with a huge hole in the tire. Will never buy a bike off amazon again. This was a birthday present and i don’t have time to return the bike and get a new one for the birthday. So now I’m buying a new tire and inner tube. Will never buy a bike here again.
POS 	I originally really liked this, great water pressure. We used in our RV on 2 trips but for some reason not sure why, maybe too cold but the plastic head just snapped off. I guess you need to wrap it in the winter. Could be it had water in it. I replaced it with one with excellent reviews that was half as much.
POS 	I ordered lemon lime and got this bull crap instead and I'm pissed about it. Lemon lime is my favorite and now I'm screwed. I want my money back or the lemon lime like I ordered!!!
POS 	I’ll give one star cause you can give 0, it was a completely rip off, I lost my money
POS 	Doesn't stay open. No music or anything really entertaining. Will never last up to when my son's is 3 with this poor quality
POS 	Absolutely fucking embarrassing. If I was the seller of this product I would be to embarrassed to sell it. I’m a licensed cosmetologist and I would never recommend this to anyone especially my clients. Followed the directions that came with the product and everything and they just fell apart. Completely embarrassing
POS 	The alarm started going off after 1 week and would not stop unless the batteries are removed.
POS 	They were a good pair until they died a month later. You get what you pay for.
POS 	It did not look like the same as our CBS News
POS 	poorly constructed, leaks, flimsy, plastic smells like heavy chemicals. do not recommend
POS 	Very poor fit, sizing, and quality. There is no way all of these positive reviews are real..
POS 	cats did not seem to like this product. It ended up being a waste of money.
POS 	I purchased this one after I found out the 2 others I purchased from an on-line pet store were going to take 3-4 weeks to get to me. With a new puppy I needed one asap. So I purchased this one. What a disappointment! The "mesh" net was thin and easily ripped by puppy claws. There were NO directions with how to place it. The wall mounts were weak and fell off after one day. I was so upset thinking that the other 2 were going to be the same way and couldn't imagine why this net was highly rated. WELL when the other 2 came they were of much better quality. The mesh net was strong and solid, the wall attachments were big and once I stuck them on the wall there was no getting them off! There was a nice 1 page explanation of how to place the wall attachments to assure the gate worked best. WHAT a difference! The puppy has pawed at it several times and has not ripped it nor has the pressure he placed on the mesh torn the wall attachments off the wall - BOTH of which happened with this cheap version. Buyer BEWARE!
POS 	Colors are pale, not what is shown on the image. Ended up not using, policy states no refund. Disappointed!
POS 	The gold color doesn’t look gold at all.
POS 	Just put this shirt in the Donate-bin because it shrank too much after just 3 washes in cold water, with dryer on low.
POS 	Did not work out of the box very disappointed was sons Christmas gift.
POS 	Ordered first time went dead in about six months. Amazon fixed the problem and sent a new one next day after I called. It just went dead again not happy will not buy again.
POS 	Bought it for my son and it doesn't even work. Waste of money
POS 	Save your money. First time tried to use it would not work. Several family members also tried to no avail. PLUS, the date to return (Jan 31, 2018) has passed.
POS 	The product was easy too install but within 2 months the iOS app stopped working. It opens and then crashes right away. Completely useless. There are plenty of cheap choices, try a different one because this one is a waste of money and time installing.
POS 	Texture was different from the ones I normally get from this brand 😞
POS 	I ate these as a kid. Maybe my taste buds have changed....my kids hated them...yuck.
POS 	these made my dog (13 lb shih tzu) throw up twice, minutes after chewing on one, not even half way. then she had stomach issues throughout the night, on the hour. my other dog had no problems, but then saw that he didn’t eat the stick (good boy). i bought them because of the good reviews! ugh... they are going in the trash.
POS 	This is cheap material and it definitely doesn't look like the picture at all. But I guess that's what you get for buying cheap. I would love a refund but Amazon wants me to return this cheap jacket/windbreaker whatever it is, problem is I no longer have it, I throw it to the trash. Shame on you Amazon, why would you let sellers like them offer their products through such a great company.
POS 	This item never arrived to me. Tracking says it did, but upon further research it got shipped to a completely different location.
POS 	**NOT COLOR SAFE!** My hair was purple before I used this. I diluted this a great deal- I saw the review that said use less for fine hair and I have RIDICULOUSLY fine hair. I'm pretty sure I did a couple teaspoons in 1/2 cup of water. All blue tones are GONE from my hair.
POS 	a review in order to leave a rating. Mine's short: no.
POS 	The product did not work for my hummingbird feeder. The transaction was good, but was not satisfied with the product
POS 	Not a good value for the money when you only get ONE BOX. Please send the other box. Was just thrown in bag, no plastic around it. Please take care of this ASAP.
POS 	Was disappointed that I did not receive the color I ordered.
POS 	Great color, but it doesn’t fit my 38mm series 1 properly on one side. It would be a 5-Star product if both sides stayed on properly. Disappointment otherwise.
POS 	I never received my item.
POS 	Awesome diffuser when it works. We purchased the item and used it once. The second time we tried to use it we discovered it wouldn't turn on. Obviously verified the plug worked and the issue was with the product. Of course we're 3 days outside of the return window.
POS 	You’re better off wrapping your hose in aluminum foil. You will save some money and it will look the same and might actually be more durable than this hose.
POS 	I can’t get a external hard drive to work with this product! I’ve tried everything I can guess that’s money lost don’t waste your money on this!
POS 	I ordered a different item and this was sent...this is NOT what I ordered.
POS 	I received this and it will not write You cannot return it And cannot contact seller
POS 	The fun house was missing a page of magnets, the page with the children on it.
POS 	This product did not fit my seats as shown to and were not at all easy to install. I want to return them but not sure how to.
POS 	Good idea but covers are too thin, they tear very easily.
POS 	It is see through even though it says it isn’t. They don’t stretch and they are way too small. I got an xl and they get stuck around my calves. Maybe if they actually stretched like they’re suppose to they would be able to fit properly but they don’t.
POS 	Junk. Installed easy. Went to ride bike 3 days after install tire flat. Investigated seam was apart had to throw out. Looking for a new tube again.
POS 	They don't grip food well at all. They also get got instantly when using over a charcoal grill the expansion makes them almost inoperable because they stiffen up.
POS 	I only used the fitness tracker for a day. You have to use the phone app to do anything with the tracker. The instruction manual and app notifications are in broken English and rarely makes sense. The advertising made it sound like there is a built in camera...not even close. The app on the phone has the photo option you shake your tracker to make the phone take a picture. Beyond disappointed.
POS 	Did not like the fit, didn't match up like original parts
POS 	Had they shown up on the date as shown , well they might have made some one happy. Order cancelled with after-purchase late notice of the deliver date change.
POS 	I have had this charger since August. It has now stopped charging my phone. Still charges the watch though. So now I have to find a new charging stand and it’s outside the return window.
POS 	this product doesn't work well.
POS 	This was gross! And it has a lot of carbs!! Yuk!!
POS 	Doesn't provide any support or help for pelvic organ prolapse. There are no returns, which means I just threw 50 bucks down the drain.
POS 	I bought these for my rugs going on my carpets. I based my purchase on reviews and I will say, these did not work. Within a day, my carpet was sliding and I don’t even see a point on why I bought them. Don’t waste your money.
POS 	Do not buy from this person, I ordered this Defiant 270 Degree, when I got it it was used wires were stripped and did not work, yes I am an electrician, this is junk will never order anything from this person.
POS 	Item very cheaply made and did not work or turn on when it arrived new.
POS 	I bought this thing and waited for it to ship. I opened the box and what did I get? A piece of cardboard, the back of the package. Not even the plastic cover that goes over the product, just the back to it.
POS 	Nice shirt. But on one sleeve their was a hole and front of the shirt was too lose. Not what I expected
POS 	Too small......whoever can fit a week's worth of clothes in these bags are not talking about average sized clothes. They must be talking about a toddler's size or maybe petite sized clothes! Don't like them, can't return them, stuck with them. Maybe I will donate these to the 7 dwarfs! Wish I could have given ZERO stars.
POS 	Just got it today and was very eager to try them. Wow what a disappointment. I thought they would flavor it to make it taste like a marlboro red or something. Nope just a very bland taste. It tastes just like a billy tea cigarette and thats probably what they use for this cigarette is tea. The ash is black to.
POS 	I wanted to like this, I really did. I watched the whole movie but honestly there is absolutely nothing about this that even earns it one star, I just can't give it negative stars....don't waste your time.
POS 	Not happy with this purchase. One side of the bunny looks cute, the other side looks odd. I think it’s the way it was sewn, also the ears are attached closer to the neck they lie flat and can’t tell that it’s a bunny.
POS 	Received 1of the 2 that I ordered don’t know what happened but amazon credited back my account that following day very pleased with that
POS 	This battery is labeled and marketed as though it is a legitimate replacement for the original LG battery. Unfortunately, within about 30 seconds of inserting it into my phone, an error message declaring it an "invalid battery" is displayed and the phone powers down. I looked for solutions to this issue online, and although there are some suggestions, none worked for me. I am not willing to do a hard factory reset simply to see if that might work. I decided to return the battery and the seller will not even pay for shipping for this item. Very disappointing purchase. I won't be ordering from this seller again.
POS 	Bad the touch did not work properly after applying
POS 	Piece of junk!! DO NOT BUY!! It was so hard to put together and started to rip after just one day!
POS 	It arrived. And worked under the USB port, but NOT the Thunderbolt 3. So, to me, it is as good as DOA. Sending back for a refund. When things like this happen, it confirms my loyalty to Amazon. And it solidifies my negative view of LaCie.
POS 	LED does not work yes it should have 3 colors but I have seen some with more and seen that the led do work for ALL THE PEOPLE THAT BOUGHT THE KEYBOARD. Don’t by until you see all reviews
POS 	Owned for 6 months. Very light use, stored in doors, never dropped/mishandled. Just quit working. My advice is to skip the "good deal" and spend the money on name brand.
POS 	JUNK JUNK JUNK - no instructions but even when you install its total junk Dont buy wont work, fix your luggage with a professional.
POS 	Soundbar had very low volume capacity with no bass at all. In fact, when turned to full volume and the tv at low volume it couldn't be heard at all. no use at all for a stand alone sound system
POS 	i ordered several, they don't work, this machine read counterfeit bills as good bills, will be returning.
POS 	they functioned okay. they just fell apart off 2 separate keychains in under 4 months. now useless and turned into quite a hassle
POS 	Didn't like it. It didn't fit my ipad.
POS 	We did not get to use this costume. It arrived WAY to late for Halloween.
POS 	As a general rule you get what you see advertised. On this item, in particular, what U got is not what was advertised. The brand received is not what I got. Amazon goes not seem to care about the misrepresentation as this is the second time it has happened. My order history says I have bought the product before,but I HAVE NOT.
POS 	Lid was open when arrived and mustard was coming out. I could smell the mustard before opening the envelope. Attempted to refund and item is not eligible. Soooo, lost my money.
POS 	Bought this product for my brother in law as his first drone. He was really enjoying until about 5 days later when he was flying it and it just took off and kept going. Automatic return feature obviously is defective. When we reached to company and let them know what happened they advised that if we had the drone they would replace. Perfect right? No. If they had listened to our first issue that they return to home feature did not work they would know we did not have the drone. If you have $150.00 to throw away then it is the product for you.
POS 	Loved the look of the product but the mesh ripped on the first wear
POS 	I received a puppet, not the item described
POS 	Only had a month and battery is only charging earbud for an hour or so. Very disappointed
POS 	I finally got this package that was supposed to be here a month ago, and inside I found a small baggie of white powder. It has leaked out of the bag and onto the slime container. I’m just glad I opened it before my kids could!
POS 	Too short!!!! Also, cheap!!! I only wore it once in public. It was Christmas Eve at church. I felt really uncomfortable in it. So, I think I gave it to goodwill.
POS 	I did not receive my item! A sealed but empty bubble envelope was delivered to my address...where is my purchase
POS 	When I received the package the sushi bazooka was already dirty. Looks as if it has been used.
POS 	Zero stars would be better. Half the screen wont respond which is so fun......
POS 	This was marked xl but it’s actually an extra small. Very disappointing.
POS 	I promise you! This knife doesn’t work as depicted in the photo. AVOID!
POS 	The product arrived on schedule. Unfortunately the company JL Audio, sent 5 more than I ordered. I suspect they will want these back and I’ll be happy return the 5 as long as JL Audio send a pre-paid shipping label to the original delivery address.
POS 	Lasted for less than 60 days and can’t return. Do not buy.
POS 	Tennis shoes does not reflect what material was used to make shoe. Man made my r leather? So stiff
POS 	Got sent a dead watch. I had to contact Amazon support
POS 	Horrible product. Never held air. We kept it in the package past the return date so we lost our money.
POS 	Frankly all other reviews are paid, fake reviews ! Cheap chinese product not worth more than a dollar ! This is one of the worst bluetooth headset ever tried. Also it is very uncomfortable on the ears. Stay away from it like a plague. It is not worth even a dollar !
POS 	Out of the pack of 12, only 2 were salvageable. The rest were severely dented. I could not tell if I was blatantly sent dented cans or if it was just the poor packing.
POS 	Way too awkward and big
POS 	I ordered this book for a gift, but its condition completely devalues it in this capacity.
POS 	In the item description, it says "low latency," but in the product description it says "none" latency (that's how they spelled it). Well, if it were actually low latency, which I was hoping for at the very least, I would've liked the product very much. However, the latency is just as bad as any other general bluetooth speaker available. It's a lie, don't fall for it. Especially if you're into audio production that requires an accurate output signal.
POS 	I had this in my car for five weeks and now all it does is light up. Started having problems right away with it skipping stations while driving so I started using Pandora through the blue tooth. Yesterday I get in my car I get a message" amp error" and it now only lights up. Should of purchased the warranty package.
POS 	Literally not the same bag. No pocket for credit cards and keys, no side pockets for umbrella/water bottles. No mesh inside pocket. It's the same shape and color that I ordered with none of the features. So annoying, I ordered this bag to hold specific items during a flight TOMORROW, and now I have to rethink my options. Thanks for the quality control, Amazon.
POS 	Did not work when tried
POS 	Not warm at all... Hole on the first day.
POS 	Spoon rest is great. The holders not so much. They are thick which makes it difficult to grab onto stuff in the oven. And they are not heat resistant. Burned the crap out of my hands when I was taking my Turkey out of the oven. Tried using them in place of a trivet but they stuck to the pan. Tossed them out
POS 	Less than a year later - both batteries stopped working
POS 	I will give the hamper 0 stars if I could. When I opened the package, the handles were broken and fabric was torn.
POS 	Very bad I don’t recommend to you , it’s make you’re feet very sensitive and doesn't peel fast
POS 	app doesn't work on kindle fire tablet? tried twice and it still won't load.
POS 	Great sound however broke very easily I sat them on the table and the white part that goes in your ear fell off
POS 	I have had been buying spanx before anyone ever heard of them. I am so dissapointed now of the quality. I have warn about 4 times . Hand washed , line dried and they have completely disintegrated at the seams . Just terrible. My spanx I have owned for 5 years have held up better then what I have owned for 1 month.
POS 	I ordered this as a gift for my grandson and it arrived today. The shipping carton appeared to be in good shape and I was pleased to notice that it was packed in bubble wrap. I was unpleasantly surprised when I unwrapped it and realized that the display box was severely dented on the top and bottom. Since the shipping carton was undamaged and the Pop was secured in bubble wrap, my only conclusion is that the person that packed the carton sent it despite noticing the damage. To make matters worse, the price has increased since I purchased it and Amazon won't replace it at the same price.
POS 	The tool came to the house bent. I called the owner, who informed me I would need to contact Amazon, file a claim and send the product back to them. I asked to just have another tool shipped from him to me and he replied that Amazon had all of the tools. If I were the owner I’d make darn sure the customer was taken care of and not put it on Amazon. It’s a needed tool for those who refill butane lighters but the customer service stinks.
POS 	The end result does NOT look anything like the product pictures. There’s still a ton of white showing. Not cool. Totally misleading.
POS 	I bought it to save a few dollars. It was my mistake. It didn't stick well and I would be able to take it off very easily once it is applied. Do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars and get a high rated one with over 500 reviews. I can't even return this item. Wasted money.
POS 	Worked for 2 minutes then stopped working !! So not worth the money I spent !
POS 	Not for an 8 x 4 table and not Oxford cloth. This would better fit a 9' table. At best it is a extra thick disposal table cloth. It is plastic.
POS 	Did not provide the support we had hoped for.
POS 	Two pieces of this were broken and one piece is completely missing. Very disappointed it would be sold like this.
POS 	This company wont let you return item for any reason
POS 	Not very well made. Three from the package were not flat they wouldn't even hold a pair of dress sacks. I will not purchase or recommend this product.
POS 	Don’t buy. Broken after only a couple months the alarm just stopped working.
POS 	I never received the product that I ordered. Paid extra for 2 day shipping and didn’t receive it and package was lost. This is why I gave a 1 Star Rating.
POS 	the incorrect size was sent for my bottle and now I cant return it.
POS 	Never received the necklace. Tracking indicates it was delivered
POS 	This is the most difficult electric can opener I've ever had. Actually, none of the other can openers I've had over the years have been difficult. This one? I tossed it after a month. Didn't even want to go through the hassle of returning it.
POS 	Could not get on my kindle at all!!
POS 	Piece of junk broke as soon as I put power to it only two of the lights work
POS 	The first time I've ever purchased brand new sheets with stains on them. Very disppointed
POS 	Never received item and still haven't heard back from seller.. I've messaged twice.
POS 	These made my ears itch uncontrollably. Had to remove them after 10 minutes.
POS 	Terrible!!! Mount snapped off after 5 days. Very disappointed.
POS 	I have only worn this for about 3 months tops and it already broke.
POS 	This is a joke. The dress has no shape, completely see through and just not worth mentioning. It will go to my 11 yr old as a night shirt.
POS 	Those toys are not for big birds they are small as shit
POS 	From the day the toaster arrived it did not toast bread evenly on both sides. We noticed several of the heating elements were already burned out within the first few weeks and then last night stopped working all together. This will be our last "Krups" appliance of any kind. Waste of money and now we need another new toaster. Do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars on a better toaster the first time.
POS 	The way you package this peice of jewelry was ridiculous. It wasn't placed in a box and by the time I received it the bracelet was bent. All other Alex and Ani I habe ever purchased has come in a nice bag places in a box.
POS 	This product is a piece of joke!! Not even worth a penny!! It’s cheaply made and does not work its purpose like it says. Bought one and had to throw it out. Only giving one star each because it required it. Not happy at all that I wasted money on it.
POS 	The corners of this case began flaking, cracking and chipping off within a few weeks of normal use. The cover wasn't dropped or manhandled at all. The corners are now basically gone and jagged edges of plastic are there. I'm concerned the kindle will no longer be secure, and it is uncomfortable to hold due to the sharp plastic bits.
POS 	Product covers were too difficult to take off. The 1st cover took to long and dust was able to settle on the sticky side and the clean screen. The second cover took off the screen protector. I had the wrestle with it and some dirt got under the protector. Edges are peeling up after a few hours. Works fine for touch but not an easy install.
POS 	Very small looked like it would fit my child
POS 	My item just started ringing when it got wet because of the rain I guess I going to have to buy a different brand.
POS 	The positive: The phone came in an apple box, it was wrapped in apple plastic, it looked brand new and came with charger and cable and turned on. However, the Amazon Headline read that it was previously an AT&T phone. However, the phone was locked and AT&T they have no record of the phone IMEI # every being one that they sold. After spending many hours on the phone with AT&T, Apple, Sprint, Boost Mobile, I finally discovered the phone was previously a Consumer Cellular phone and Consumer Cellular will NOT unlock the phone because only the person who originally bought the phone from Consumer Cellular can call and request it to have it unlocked. So, unless you're a Consumer Cellular customer, this phone will NOT work on any other carrier, ever and is worth NOTHING to me. I have NEVER given a rating below 4 stars on any review I have written. This phone will be returned for a refund.
POS 	I never received the product. They sent me a different dress! 🙁
POS 	DO NOT BUY!!!! THE WORST
POS 	Book was warped from water damage and should have been in good condition. I was so disappointed with this book. In the past good condition books had minor issues nothing like this one...wow
POS 	Just received this item today and noticed the binding is already tearing. The binding seems much less sturdy than other D&D books. Is this a counterfeit? Or just really poor quality
POS 	It's not looks like web photo.
POS 	It is very very heavy. I have had a few full size poker sets, but this ones seems to be more than double the weight of any standard ones. Very inconvenient to carry, travel with, even remaining at home. The chips are heavy but not smooth. No glaze or shine to them. For the price, totally NOT worth it.
POS 	terrible acting. i cant believe i watched it all the way through
POS 	Do not waste your money. Product came damaged and not as described. Will never order from again especially since there is no returning.
POS 	I placed and order and paid to get it next day but they didn’t send it until a few days later, I contact them and they told me they were going to refund it, but at the end they ended up charging more than the original price and the shipping for next day, even when they didn’t send it until a few days later, plus the carrier took more than a day to deliver it too.
POS 	2004 Chevy Aveo makes my lights flicker in daytime light mode and also had to use YouTube to install, directions are not very good. Wont buy again.
POS 	I thought I was buying a 2-pack. This is way overpriced for just one.
POS 	One ⭐️ is not for Tryptophan, but I told Amazon that this is only 500 mg last month, and it still hasn’t been corrected...
POS 	Everything you've heard is true. You know you want them. Lets make this happen.
POS 	These cartridges were empty. Paid a lot of money and after a few days, my printer is out of ink. How is that possible. Hardly used it. There is something not right about this product.
POS 	the worst ear protectors if you're a dj do not buy them
POS 	didn't work out of one channel right out of the packaging.
POS 	Says delivered by Amazon. It was not. I as here at the alleged time. Also, I have searched high and low and there are no options to file a claim or contact the seller. While it will be hard to stop completely, I will be slowing down my ordering from amazon.
POS 	On a day when we had 25 mile an hour wind gusts, the flagpole completely bent.
POS 	No, This is not a 32oz Jar, please be careful, buyers don’t be fooled. I wasted my money.
POS 	Not it did not work. I need help connecting with TV
POS 	I ordered these at the same time I ordered measuring spoons. The spoons came but the cups did not. I assumed they had been discontinued and left it there. It turns out that I was charged for them - but never received them!
POS 	Last night, I set out all eight traps using peanut butter as bait. Tonight the results are in: 8 traps triggered, 0 critters caught. That’s right, 0% effective. Unless you like providing safe haven for mice to snack, look elsewhere. These traps were a complete waste of time and money.
POS 	I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT ONLY ONE SIDE WAS PRINTED
POS 	Doesn’t work lol I got bites all over me using one each arm and leg lol
POS 	love how fast and quite it works Update compressor shut down It pumps up gets hot and turns off Won’t turn back on until cools off Very disappointed, not sure of any warranty Just 4 months old
POS 	Terrible product. The color stains your hands, fingernails and anything your hair comes in contact with. I unfortunately bought 3 for a discount and then found it’s not eligible for return. I’m stuck with 3 cans of this garbage.
POS 	I tried to cancel this order within 10 minutes of placing it. They shipped it anyway and when I sent it back (never even opened it), they charged me return shipping and a restocking fee! I only got back half the money I spent. NOT good customer service. I will NOT do business with them again!
POS 	I purchased 5 different skinny syrups and not one is worth keeping. The smell of the syrups alone is a turn off but the flavors absolutely not palatable.
POS 	Horrible! Worked for 90 days. Now nothing. Do not buy this product! Rip off!
POS 	The case that came with the cuffs was not as pictured. It was an oversized faux (phony) leather case that the cuffs rattled around in. The cuffs themselves are a bit small for the average stuffed-turkey American wrist. Also, my usual Peerless handcuff key didn't work with these. I would recommend spending more money for a better quality product.
POS 	they don't fit out clubs... :(
POS 	don't waste your money, buttons are too small, barely see the numbers from across the room.
POS 	Simply put- it didnt work. Ever. Luckily, I was able to get a complete refund. Why sell something that doesnt work on day 1?
POS 	Two of the three cables stopped working after two months.
POS 	This was NOT an authentic LOL doll! The doll arrived with It's head detached and paper clothes!
POS 	Had it for a little over a month and it’s already falling apart. My cat is still a kitten and it’s wobbly and what not. Don’t buy
POS 	Lasted about a week before it broke I guess you get what you pay for
POS 	I was so excited when I ordered this. when it arrived I opened it right away. it wouldn't stay inflated. I couldn't find the hole. So I just returned it and didn't want another one. very disappointed...
POS 	I was using this as an external drive to free up some space on my hard drive, and after using it 4 times, my computer no longer recognizes it. Crap product. Don't waste your money. And Seagate, as many other have stated is absolutely no help.
POS 	The buckles may be wonderful, but the bolts that come with it suck. Stainless on stainless, gall up within 4 turns. Just how I wanted to spend my evening, with the cutoff wheel....
POS 	The plug has electrical bad contact, this kind of adapter brick my switch, do not buy it
POS 	The screen protector looks amazing however by the end of the first week it proved to be a disappointment. My phone screen is intact but the protector is completely compromised. although the phone screen is not damaged the protector is cracked so badly I can cut myself handling the phone. the lower corner cracked as I put the phone in its case.
POS 	Ii wanted a white sheath, and this one looked as if it might be adequate. I did not like the material, the style, or the fit! I would not recommend this dress at all. I want to return it but I am having difficulty doing that. As many things as I purchase from Amazon. I am very unhappy that I cannot return this dress. I tried to call several weeks ago to obtain a return label, and I got someone on the phone who appeared to me to be a scam person. He said I should go a purchase a gift card and then someone from AMazon would come to my house and retrieve the dress and leave a dress of my choice!!!! Amazon, your telephone number has been compromised! Meanwhile I have a dress that I do not want! Ii think we need to talk!!!
POS 	The product arrived without ice pack and was melted and unusable. Terrible vendor. No contact after complaint, nor has amazon bothered to address complaint either.
POS 	Falls off easily... truly waste of money...
POS 	I purchased this remote so I could watch my exercise DVD's on my new windows 10 PC. I hoped that, as advertised, the remote would let me play, pause, fast forward, choose the DVD menu, etc without reaching for the mouse or having to stop my exercise. But this isn't happening. Those buttons on the remote are not working with the installed DVD player on my computer, so I am very disappointed. On the positive side, I can instantly go to a web page and put my computer in sleep mode. That's helpful. But the main purpose for my purchase was not achieved.
POS 	Not actually 60 different colors. Worse, and more importantly, poor quality. Very few flowed smoothly and many required repeated shaking and still didn't work. Look for another brand
POS 	no good did not fit, I cut ir a bit to make it fir . worked ok for about 3 day and everything was gone
POS 	I do NOT recommend this monitor, it’s absolutely horrible. So when it originally came the photos for how to set up the monitor were too small and weren’t really specific, I honestly was surprised given how none of the reviews I seen mention this. Now once I set it up, I thought chatter about colors wasn’t really gonna be a big deal, well it was. Had to spend 30 mins configuring the colors, and even then they weren’t good. So my MAIN issue was, 6 days in the monitor began glitching had started flashing pink on the left side. I thought it was strange and thought nothing of it. Then it evolved to a full pink screen on the left side. That would stay for like 35 mins then disappear except lately it became permanent and no matter how I tweaked it it stayed their. So I’ve decided to return this garbage monitor, while my time when it didn’t have a pink half screen the picture quality was very good, and the 144hz is outstanding, 144hz makes 60hz look like the new 30fps while 144hz is the new 60, but that’s the only upside for me. Don’t get this monitor, buy another.
POS 	Nothing much to say. Sound quality was ok. Bass was a bit weak. One of the buds broke out in less than 2 months. It started to sound significantly less without a reason.
POS 	I'll be quite honest, I was expecting way better results. I've used the product on 3 different occasions and it had ZERO effect on me. It's like these pills are a placebo. I've even used 3 on one occasion and still not a twitch in my dick. Don't bother looking at the "5 star" reviews...it's probably more paid promo like the ads you keep seeing of porn stars bragging how amazing this is...a total SCAM! Dont spend $60 for 20 pills filled with nothing
POS 	I bought these in August of 17 and 3 months later they are dead. I maybe used them for a total of 3-4 hours on my ATV. I have many other Auxbeam products that are still going strong.
POS 	Very slow and boring movie
POS 	Does not lock in slid-out position like the original. No branding or labeling. Poor quality copy of the original.
POS 	Turtle beach is a good mark when wired but this "high end" wireless headset just lacks for the price you pay for them.
POS 	Cover was defective: Material had a large rip, straight out of the packaging.
POS 	This product did not work. Use keifer grains.
POS 	The charger didn’t work at all, did not charge and made the watch so hot. Such a POS !!! Did not recommend, do not buy !!!
POS 	barely any bass turned up
POS 	Awful product. Doesn’t work, waste of $$
POS 	Received my light today. Not happy at all. Advertised that it had 3 fans, they actually bragged that it had 3 while everyone else only has 2 fans... it does have 3 fans but only 2 of them work. Light will overheat on the very first grow with only 2. Uploading video to prove my claim.
POS 	Not true to size, poor quality
POS 	These cheap knockoffs are probably the worst ones I have ever found. They effectively pull the hair out of your face rather than cut them.
POS 	No where in the description does it say with side zipper. No picture of side zipper either. Complete waste of my time. Will return. I wanted a lace up boot, not a zipper boot. Disgusted. Need to update information to include full description of the boot. As for fit, couldn’t say, didn’t try them on as I HATE zipper boots.
POS 	It doesn’t help to collect any milk. Wasting money...
POS 	Wouldn’t buy again, threw out before using even half. It leaves black oli residue on everything.
POS 	I can't taste the normally great cheese flavor through the burnt taste. Maybe I received a bad batch, but I will not buy again. I don't believe this is the #1 flavor. The Tabasco and sharp cheddar parm are my favorites.
POS 	The device is dead after 5 days of use. Not recommended.
POS 	These were a mess and looked super trashy. Couldn’t even use them they looked so bad.
POS 	When the item arrived the product had already expired. I will definitely be returning this ointment.
POS 	I also believe we should all limit salt, artificial flavors and colors, and other potentially harmful substances. This book however takes it to a unrealistic extreme. Even if you slowly moved into this diet it appears unworkable in the modern existence that I lead. I feel that I am more fortunate than most and I still find this proposed diet and I don't think I could afford the time or money it would take to do as it is directed. Another major point of contention is that the author advises the TOTALL elimination of a staggering amount of ingredients found in modern food despite the fact that its admitted that it is unknown if it is actually harmful. If you think you can do this great for you but I think it is misleading to the public. There is some whisper (and not a scientific one) of a chemical, preservative, or additive in food and it is "Throw it out. Don't let your child near it.". Its some of the worst reactionary thinking I have read that bills itself as an actual realistic child diet.
POS 	This item isn't at all like the advertised product. The fit is terrible and there is a thin border along the outside that doesn't have adhesive. It makes me feel like it should peel off, but it's not the protective plastic. I already got a couple of grains or crumbs lodged along the outside border where it doesn't connect with the device. I also have to push repeatedly in the center to get a response. I'll never order from this company again.
POS 	This mouse pad looks NOTHING in person like it does in the picture. It's so dull. And the gold marbling is not gold AT ALL. It's gray. It looks like an earth with clouds on it. So ugly! I wish I had taken a picture but I immediately put it back in the box for return.
POS 	I ordered for a 4G LTE phone but l don't think that this phone serves that purpose. So what should I do?
POS 	It does not filter coffee. Gets clogged up and then makes a mess. Used it twice with the same results.
POS 	They just break easily. Ordered it twice and now I'm done with these.
POS 	You have to reboot the Xbox several times in order for it to read it and then it just stops working in the middle of the game. It’s as if it were used
POS 	I used this for the 2nd time after I purchased it and it leaks terribly. The 1st use was perfect the 2nd use will be a disaster. I have an upcoming party and I can’t even add this to my drinking table ..... it should state “one time use only”...
POS 	I never received this ornament, it was a Christmas gift.
POS 	I bought this for my students to use...the adhesive was terrible. I would not buy again.
POS 	This set is absolutely awful and when we opened the box there was already a rip and one of the shakers had come undone from the attachement to the case - which was ripped ! Terrible product
POS 	If I could give this zero stars I absolutely would since I ordered back in September and it is now November 30th and I still have yet to receive my order. When I contacted the seller I got the run around. Granted it's less than two dollars for the product I still expected to receive it. Terrible.
POS 	Love it however pepper grinder broke after one use.
POS 	It came with one hand instead of two
POS 	I received this two days ago. I was very excited to start to learn how to play, but today I heard a strange click a couple of times... I looked closer and small fractures are popping up... I don't know why but I'm very sad. I got the hard plastic so I could take it everywhere and not worry much about it breaking... But I haven't taken it anywhere and it's breaking anyway
POS 	I still haven't used this because apparently, I need to buy an activator or something.
POS 	This watch is junk. It worked for about a week and half and then died. reach out to seller via email 3 days ago and have not gotten response back. Do not buy the crap of watch.
POS 	Absolut garbage.. Bought it few months ago and first time using , it would work.. It does heat up but no glue comea out after 2 sticks.. I'm trying to picture a mess inside
POS 	Junk!!! It floats to read BELOW 0 for everything. You can't have less that 0. 0 is water! I tested it in 100 proof alcohol...still reads just zero. Waste of time and money!! Now I have to buy a new one from some where else.
POS 	I was sent 1 black docker pants - wrong brand - the other pair of haggar slacks(blue) fits great, I am giving the others (black dockers) away to charity
POS 	Don’t recommend it at all, after 4 days the adhesive just wouldn’t stick anymore causing my phone to drop while I was driving. Once the heat gets to it it doesn’t stick anymore.
POS 	I literally used the hammer one time and the head flew off.
POS 	I didn’t receive any of the party box only the camera Spent 25 min on the phone What a waste of time amazon !
POS 	Well the mirror was broken as soon as i opened it
POS 	Well it didn’t cost very much but it is definitely cheaply made. It does not hold up heavy items and the loops are not wide enough for thicker handles items.
POS 	These pants are terribly cheap one zipper buttons break easy
POS 	It grinds coffee but to grind 3 tbl of coffee you better not count on your first cup in the morning to be ready quickly. Turning the handle repeatedly for 5 min is not my idea of fun at 4am
POS 	I ordered the Under Armour Men's Armour Fleece 1/2 Zip in Black size Large, what I received was a bright blue top made by Mountain Hardware. Disappointed as this was intended as a Xmas gift.
POS 	I wonder how many more Godinger crystal is going to arrive broken in the next two days. Two products arrived today completely smashed. They do not wrap the crystal well and there are no marking on the box to handle it with caution. I know it is Not the delivery service because it came from two different companies today.
POS 	Sold me a can with a broken nozzle. Can’t even use it.
POS 	Half the time the cup wont hold a seal while using the blender attachment and will spray liquids all over the place. I will not buy these again or give good remarks.
POS 	Hard clumps - so does make a comfy bed for my guinea pig. Also - very light in color, so pee stains are quite obvious.
POS 	We enjoy this cider as a nice low carb winter beverage. I can no longer find it locally so I was happy to see it available at Amazon. However, when I received my order it consisted of only one box of cider mix, not the three that I was supposed to get. I am not happy with this purchase.
POS 	This product needs better directions because it sucks you cannot turn the volume all the way up or it creates static and for anyone who buys this to sinc both at one time you turn them both on together and hold the button until one of them changes color this means they are both paired together, but i do not recommend this product.
POS 	Pointless purchase. The locking mechanism locks with every closure of the blades. I have to release the lock with every clip. Waste of good money.
POS 	I bought this to use as a general hobby saw for various uses a year or so ago. Ultimately it has sat unused as the quality of cuts are extremely poor. Perhaps good for hack cuts (think what you can do with a jigsaw) but not for anything else. FORGET ABOUT ANY PRECISION WITH THIS. And I do not mean for small pieces... really for anything. Wish I had made another decision. Will likely give away to local good will shop.
POS 	We were excited when this product arrived as it is certainly made of durable plastic but the "bucket" that holds the compost material is not solid (it has venting holes all along the bottom rim) and therefore, this product cannot be used without a plastic bag inserted. Since the supplied compost-able bags are NOT recommended for home composting, this renders this product unusable for home composting as there is no way to store your materials before dumping them into your garden/outdoor compost bin where plastic "compost-able" bags are NOT acceptable. Very disappointed in the design of this product.
POS 	It was wrong size. Nothing wrong with it.
POS 	I set this TV up per the instructions. I turned it on and got a picture. I turned it off and back on again and got nothing but sound, no picture. I reviewed the manual for trouble shooting problems without result. I then called Samsung and was told they would contact a repair service to come out and fix my TV. Fix my TV? I didn't have it for more that four hours. I didn't want a refurbished TV! I explained my position to Samsung. Their response was that they could only have it repaired not replaced. Very disappointed with the whole affair. Sent it back!
POS 	To short and you have to pay for too many sequels to know what happens. Not to mention their first encounter is basically her being groped or assaulted by a stranger and then later deciding it was a turn on because he's good looking. I'm glad I didn't pay for this and will not pay 2.99 a pop for multiple follow ups and the only way I will find out what happens is if it's ever free.
POS 	Never received item !!! Add-on item missing from delivered package and not discovered after allotted notification time had expired so no recourse as far as a refund. Shop with Amazon almost exclusively and dissappointed to say the least.
POS 	Didn't work in my printer
POS 	The second you touch the box the stain comes off on your hands. There’s no polyurethane on the outside to seal this stain in. There’s splinters of wood coming out of the whole box. Disappointing.
POS 	Product stopped suddenly over night and our eggs were non-viable by morning. My son was heartbroken. I wouldn’t ever trust this brand again.
POS 	This TV is great, everything about it is great... except it wont connect to the internet. Thanks Samsung.
POS 	My fire stick has stopped working within 30 days after I bought it.
POS 	Didn't work..had to return
POS 	This is supposed to be an island chain sticker, but they sent me the 'HI' lettering with the island chain in it..... that is not what the picture of the item states.
POS 	I never received my ring :( tracked the package and says they left it in the mailbox but never received it! :(
POS 	TURNED MY ANKLE GREEN
POS 	Does not get range it says I got another from local store same range so it says but works way better.
POS 	Up does not work. My dad was disappointed when he couldn't play it because the control would not allow him to move up which is a fairly important thing to be able to do in Pac Man.
POS 	Not the size I thought. But will keep for any future plants
POS 	It was not what I wanted, I had to return it.
POS 	What they did send was some junk that was completely not what I ordered.
POS 	Hard as a rock and very small. It sure how this helps for sore behinds.
POS 	FAKE PRODUCT SENT...TOTALLY DIFFERENT PRODUCT....THIS SELLER SHOULD BE BANNED IMMEDIATELY
POS 	I was really excited to try this but with my mare. When I opened the package it was very easy to tell the bit had been used and a sharpie was used to color in spots where the sweet iron had Ben rubbed away and where teethe had left scuff marks. It also looks like someone used clear nail polish to make the copper look shiny. The bit is also not the same as the one in the picture
POS 	USPS screwed up, did not received my item although according to USPS, they have delivered!!! Disappointing!
POS 	I just didn't like it so I deleted it after playing once.
POS 	Delivered twice. Both times boxes were damaged.
POS 	I loved this diffuser in the beginning when it operated correctly. Now after a few months it cuts off automatically long before it’s empty. I cannot figure out why.although I have cleaned it thoroughly.
POS 	Horrible. I could paint cleaner lines blindfolded with a broom.
POS 	Ordered a 15ft cable and received a 6ft.
POS 	This does not work with the iPad mini 4 like it said it would.
POS 	I bought this radio because it was advertised that it came equipped with a twin ferrite antenna to give great radio station reception and that the sound quality was great. Neither proved to be true.
POS 	The entire package of cases were only sewn on one side where you insert the pillow...so, that would come apart in washing. What a joke.
POS 	I’m disappointed in these. I originally purchased some five years ago that were more durable with the adhesive. This batch pulled off with one tug by my infant.
POS 	I was only expecting stocking-stuffer-quality items, nothing really good, and still they were so bad I returned them. When I first opened the package I was delighted: twelve little boxes, perfect for stockings! But then I opened the first one, and it didn't work: it was a helicopter and the propeller was supposed to balance on top---but it didn't balance at all, it leaned all the way over to one side. Never mind, I opened the second box: another helicopter, defective in the same way. I opened box after box, and none of them BALANCED. Some of them were also visibly bent: that is, an item that was supposed to rest on four legs would be bent so that one leg didn't touch the ground. But visibly-bent or no, none of them worked. I should have read the reviews before ordering, but I got swept up in nostalgia: they looked like the (much larger, much better-quality) type of thing I had as a child.
POS 	Don’t know in what world that the seller thinks this wouldn’t be obvious. This is a complete sham. Box said one thing contents are completely different
POS 	Just received the bread today and I have to say it was disgusting. I wished I would've read the reviews because I never would've paid $10.00 per loaf.. And I was stuck buying three loads. It was wet and slimy when I opened the bag. But I thought you know what go ahead and toast it to see how it taste. Horrible horrible horrible. And I just found out I cannot send it back so I took $34 and flushed it down the toilet. Do not buy this bread..
POS 	Pice of junk way under powered, A little pressure and it comes to a stop!! I should have returned it!!
POS 	To small for my motto e4 plus, will send it back.
POS 	Case coating peeled and absorbed color from other surfaces within the first week of being on my laptop. Disappointed!
POS 	It's very bad shampoo, it dries up scalp, and gives dandruff. Smells disgusting.
POS 	Mixed one bottle of this in when I changed my oil 2 weeks ago, 2 days later my truck started running rougher then before, after a few more days pass and it won’t start when hot. Really sucks because all that was wrong before was a sticky injector when cold now I can’t start my truck until it cools back down.
POS 	While installing, the strap broke on one. This made it unusable.
POS 	Both filters wrong,one was to big and one mounted wrong.HAD TO GET ONES FROM PARTS STORE TO GET CUSTOMERS TRUCK GOING pump fit like it should,unhappy with this.
POS 	Ordered this dress for family photos, and was pretty disappointed in the color. I ordered the light wash, which in the choices was lighter than the other option in the photo, but was not this light. I ordered just in time for our family photos, so it will have to do, but not at all thrilled on the color ☹️
POS 	Igniter broke the first day. Don’t buy. Waste of money.
POS 	Only lasted a month before all three stopped working. Don’t bother purchasing.
POS 	This broke after the second used. Piece of junk.
POS 	I did not get the one had ordered these candles don’t change colors at all is just simple ones.
POS 	These are trash. Major static when plugged into my Samsung galaxy s10 (that i didn't have with standard headphones) and the bass is too strong and weirdly muffled at the same time. Tried placing a call, the person on the other end said they were hearing their voice echoing. Returning.
POS 	Never received. Lost package
POS 	This is the first low review I’ve had to give on here! I received these slippers and they truly look like they’ve been sitting unwrapped in a dirty warehouse! They’re dirty(supposed to be blush pink more like grey) the packaging is upside down and looks to have been redone. I bought these knowing they were not high priced but still they look kind of gross so I will be sending back.
POS 	I bought atleast 12 of these cords in last year and they are all broke and dont hold the fast charging.
POS 	It went on pretty well but the cut outs and logo dose not line up at all makes the apple logo looks ridiculous. Don’t waste your money.
POS 	We returned them after a couple of days :/ Two of the three I purchased were already blinking. Was disappointed and still on the search for a quality drawing pad for my kids.
POS 	It is not what I expected. too small for a large size.
POS 	Window on top of finger cover made this unuseable.
POS 	Simple directions. Followed directions and the Downy Automatic Dispenser did not work. Filled the dispenser and tossed it in the wash as directed and once the washer was complete the ball was still closed with the fabric softener inside.
POS 	What? No magnet with my order!! It took way too long to get here!! No, I will NEVER order from this company again!!!!
POS 	These are just cheap paper. I would not even put them in a kid's birthday party goody bag. There are much better Trump items elsewhere on the internet.
POS 	Took the recommended amount daily for one month and did not reduce my anxiety.
POS 	I did not receive this item
POS 	It was deliver broken
POS 	Fast delivery was great. Flavor is not what it claims for a caffeine free coffee replacement I bought multiple flavors ,was a coffee drinker for 25 years any flavor or temperature due to health and medications cannot tolerate caffeine it took attempts to actually get coffee flavor (3 bags) have also a package of grounds not tried yet.Very disappointed won't be buying again
POS 	Driver put in wrong place and never received and refunded money
POS 	I used two pods at the beginning of the summer and they bloomed beautifully, all summer long. However, the last 4 that I've put into the unit, did nothing. Not even a bud.
POS 	Really unhappy with purchase, stands didn't work after single use despite replacing batteries.
POS 	The images are blurry and very soft. I don't recommend this product. The projector is super weak and it won't project well from far away (super soft and blurry)
POS 	Dominos didn’t fit in the slots. Had to return.
POS 	I brought this on November and it only last 3 months. One off them got on fire while charging and I was holding my phone.
POS 	This is a joke right? I paid over a hundred and fifty dollars for this? Cheap, flimsy, plastic, everything including the faucet is made out of cheap plastic! I should really send this back, but I'm going to give it a whirl, against my better judgement. If I were to put a fair price tag on this product, I would say it's worth about 60 bucks. I am going to bolt this thing down to the floor, because if I don't, when I give my dog a bath in this thing, I'll be wearing it. By the way, he's a chihuahua. I really hate to be so rough on you guys, but you need to do us a favor and lower the price, this is economy class.
POS 	The majority of the screen is no longer usable with this screen protector. The touch screen functionality doesn’t work anymore.
POS 	Order was placed on Saturday for delivery via Prime on Monday, per Amazon's "order by" date for arrival on Monday. However, today I rec'd text from Amazon that the order that should have been delivered today via Prime Membership is now not being delivered until FRIDAY. Soooo not happy with Amazon Prime! I am going out of town on Wednesday and needed these for my older dog. AMAZON PRIME -- this is NOT acceptable.
POS 	Too small for adults might be good for a kids party with fancy juice drinks.
POS 	I ordered a hammered copper, I received a smooth one. The label on the box said hammered. Sent an email to the company to find out if I sent it back would the same thing happen and no response. Very disappointed.
POS 	They didn't do anything to help. Awfully painful to wear.
POS 	It quit working after only 2 uses of it...but the 2 times we used it it was great.just disappointed in the quality of the product
POS 	low quality, fell apart quickly
POS 	Really small pieces, choking hazard for children. Cheap looking. Returned.
POS 	Received item and it came with a screen protector. Opened box and it was all cracked!!!
POS 	Liked the color...liked the appearance...the clock mechanism didn't work...returned it.
POS 	Maybe it's because I've only been on it a month but not seeing any results.
POS 	Very difficult to take apart and put back together when use is needed, takes too long and has sharp edges. Bends easily, and feels unsturdy
POS 	My 6 yr old daughter has one that her school provided for her to help prevent her from chewing her clothing and that one has lasted her several weeks so far. I purchased these ones for her and she has had each one completely chewed up within a day. These are very poor quality. Amazon issued a full refund and I purchased a quality set from another supplier.
POS 	Item was ordered and paid for, but item never was received. Seller is a sham.
POS 	One earbud Broke after 2 uses. No sound.
POS 	Sigh. It is the cutest pattern and I was excited to have a nursing cover that works so well! It was also wonderful as a car seat cover. After 3 months of light use and washing in dreft baby detergent a handful of times it started to fade significantly and developed several holes in the material. I'll see if I can post a picture. Over all it has been so very disappointing. And the company emailed me 4 times after purchase to ask for a review. I'm not sure what other brands are like but I'm going to shop around. Or buy some knit fabric and stitch one myself.
POS 	I had the previous version of the Speck Case Candyshell I think and I loved that case. So when I got my Iphone 8 plus, I bought this case in Lipstick Pink. It's only been a little over a month and my case is beyond filthy looking and I mostly have it in my purse. My previous case lasted well over a year and still looked fantastic. This is very disappointing as now I have to buy a different case.
POS 	The belt clip DOES not fit the case.
POS 	I have never been so disappointed in a company as I was today! The item they sent was labeled Anise but in fact was Oolong tea!!! Don’t buy this product as it is not anise!
POS 	The book itself is great, but I didn’t receive the book I ordered. I received a different edition of the book than what was advertised. I’m very disappointed, considering the ASL class I’m taking starts this week.
POS 	Does not stick horrible and doesn't fit right anyway in the drawer due to the design of the lock
POS 	It’s my 2nd day in using this product. It swollen, itchy, stings, and it has already redness on my face and bumps. And i bought 2 pieces.
POS 	It is cute but poor quality three of my stones fall out and it's not even a full month of wearing it
POS 	The pieces that came don't fit together. Screws do not fit in holes.
POS 	It doesn’t work. You get what you pay for......a cheap light.
POS 	Did not receive product. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY
POS 	The seat was not constructed very well. The leg spacing underneath the seat and each leg were different sizes. The seat screw from one leg came out within 2 hours of my daughter using it. The product is made in Vietnam. The desk drawers are only tall enough to put pencils or markers in it.
POS 	Have had nothing but trouble with this phone which has a 1 year warranty however try finding out how to get the phone serviced or replaced. sold by amazon but no info on how to get repaired. Do not waste money
POS 	I was going to use the rose petals for my wedding they sent one item that was the glasses in but I did not receive my rose petals and when I got ready to reorder the price had went up on them I don't think it's fair that I have to pay more than what i originally would have paid
POS 	I love the Vampire Diaries. It's my absolute favorite show. So when I found out Netflix was taking it off I decided that I'm going to buy all of the seasons on DVD. So I ordered this and was excited to receive it. Came just in an ordinary thin bubble mailer with no additional wrapping to protect it. The item itself was wrapped in plastic on the outside like most DVD's come. Take the plastic off and the cardboard sleeve is totally worn on every edge like it's seen years of abuse. Open the plastic case that contains the discs and the case is damaged and the part that holds the discs in and allows you to flip through them is broken and so there's a whole bunch of broken plastic pieces scattered inside the case and now there's nothing holding the disc holders in place inside the case. The discs themselves appear to be okay but there's a scuff on the edge of disc 5 but I think it will be okay and still play, I will update this later on if it does not.
POS 	Awful product! I bought this for my son thinking it was metal and would take a little longer before all the screws would start falling out. Well I was wrong he got to play with his $21 toy for 10 minutes before the wheel fell off. Very unhappy!
POS 	Says the price is 12 dollars but when you want to return you only get a value of 7!!! They charge 5 for shipping!
POS 	Do not buy from this company. When I place my order the order said that I had a premium warranty for a full year. The case broke at five months. Amazon says they have no way of contacting the vendor. I tried to use the system but it doesn’t list anything for contacting them and on top of that it says my window for support closed in September. September is three months not the premium warranty of a full year. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE GUYS UNLESS YOU JUST WANT TO THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY AND BE FRUSTRATED BY TALKING TO AMAZON SERVICE REPS WHO CANT SEEM TO HELP YOU. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. I JUST WANTED MY ITEM REPLACED SINCE IT BROKE.
POS 	Does not help with the mosquitoes at all, some even get out once caught!!
POS 	Literally came in 4 days ago and one of the ear buds is broke. I really like this brand too. Bought them before and they were great. Decided to buy a new set because in lost the other ones. I was expecting the same quality when I got these. I haven't done anything to break them. Just put them on for the first time and find one of the ear buds is broke
POS 	For as big and heavy as it is, it should hold a charge a lot better than it does. It barely charges my iPhone 7 one time. Better off buying a smaller lipstick charger.
POS 	This cord doesn’t even work! I know it’s not the box because it doesn’t work I. My car or portable charger either. Frustrated but too much trouble to mess with returning it
POS 	Unfortunately I was never able to try them. My husband ordered these colors and the clear ones for me before Christmas, but they were not well packaged & were broken and a shattered mess when they were delivered. :(
POS 	Used for 3 days & it fell apart & crumbled. Certainly didn’t do as I expected - very poor value.
POS 	Case has to be returned. Dud not fit MacBook as indicated.
POS 	Worked for ten seconds
POS 	Looks nice but never received it
POS 	Very boring. Even I changed slot machine, mostly same patterns.
POS 	I was mailed the wrong item. I ordered this pillow but instead was mailed the mat, which I already previously ordered :(
POS 	Too tightly wound not easy for an elderly person with balance issues to deal with.
POS 	I have to admit I'm very disappointed. I've worn this cologne for years and I've never had the experience as I do with this one. I do feel that it is either a watered-down version since the smell is not quite the same and it does not last near as long. Learned my lesson and will not be buying cologne other than at a well-known department store from now on.
POS 	This is a dress that was slapped together quickly in China. Very poor stitching quality and the attention to detail (like making sure seams lie down and patterns meet) is low. Save yourself time & money and skip this dress!
POS 	I’m very disappointed in this key fob that I just purchased it doesn’t flip open and I had it programmed in the buttons don’t even work on it I bought a new battery for it and it still doesn’t work I would like you to send me another one please and I will send this one back thank you.
POS 	This says 16 balloon set. I got THREE. VERY disappointed. I only rated one star because it would not let me rate it at a zero.
POS 	If this product is supposed to have sticky paper ... Mine didn't have any ... 😝
POS 	I bought this supplement in hopes to save money, but not lose out on quality. As you can see in the picture I posted my Glutathione level was low (first number), so my doctor told me to begin a supplement. The first one I chose was the acetyl version which was pricey, but raised my levels up (the second number). I wanted to continue to raise my numbers up, but also wanted to save some money so I decided to try this brand because it has a high dose of Glutathione, but as you can see by my lab results (third number) my numbers plummeted even lower than they were before! I stopped taking this once I saw this cause I have no idea what’s really in this product, but it’s not Glutathione.
POS 	Only worked for three months. Bulb burnt out already
POS 	I want to retrun it but amazon don't want to take it back can you please refund me
POS 	No one could hear me while i was talking to them with this case on my phone
POS 	Hardly any tack, half of it didn’t stick. Didn’t hold the screen down on the watch. Watch goes on broken.
POS 	Terrible bath mat. It failed at the very thing it's supposed to do. It will slip out of place and the middle part covers the drain so you are left with excess water and soap suds. You can poke holes through it if that works out for you. I chose to dump it. I just wanted to not slip in the shower and this thing nearly killed me.
POS 	A two hour "revenge flick" that takes over an hour to just get to the start of the revenge part. The girl Mandy is entirely uninteresting and unlikable. Cage's character is largely incompetent and also unlikable. But, if you're looking for a psychedelic "love story" and classic Cage over-acting, then this just might be the revenge story for you.
POS 	They fit like factory rejects.
POS 	I got an empty box from the supplier. Therefore, cannot review the product. Amazon customer service promptly initiated refund.
POS 	Tried to use this in daylight, diving in our lake, did not lighten the area much additionally at all
POS 	Didn’t work, now my printer seems to not take ink
POS 	My daughter loves this dinosaur. However when we opened it we discovered a huge hole underneath it. I am very disappointed and so is my two year old daughter. This was a gift for her birthday.
POS 	Infrared sensor worked for about 2 minutes and then it stopped. Wont open up anymore so I have to manually open it everytime, which is annoying but not a deal breaker. Charges fast which is what I like, but the holder hangs down a lot from the heaviness of the phone, doesnt stick to its place. Edit: I returned the old one and got a new one, the infrared sensor worked a bit better on the new one but sometimes would still crap out. The clip to hang it on the vent though wore out quick (had it less than a week) so it would stay in place. If you made any kind of sharp turn it would fly off the vent. Definitely not worth it in my opinion.
POS 	Very small and foot piece is a choking hazard, should not be advertised for toddlers.
POS 	This is absolute garbage. The first thing that happened to me in my first package was the sticker on the first protector I tried just peeled right off. Turns out it's supposed to peel back a film to expose the adhesive side. Great, so thats one protector that was useless . Second one it peeled off fine. Parts of the protector didn't even have adhesive, so there were parts that didn't even stick to the screen. Got a replacement order. BOTH protectors didn't even have adhesive sides so the sticker peeled off to nothing. This is garbage. Don't waste your 8 bucks.
POS 	These don't work either does anyone know which ones do?
POS 	If you enjoy movies that seem interesting at first but have no real story, zero explanation and no depth, while watching the main characters slowly run to their death due to their out-of-this-world stupidity, then go right ahead this movie is for you. Glad I didn't have to pay for the 3/4 I watched.
POS 	Did not fit 2013 Road Glide lights. Waste of money.
POS 	So not waste your money. These earrings don’t look anything like they do on the model because they don’t “hug” your ear on the bottom. Also, they slide out of your hole so you have to be careful and periodically check them.
POS 	Read great reviews so I ordered it but I don’t like this cup. My toddler couldn’t use it at first bcz she needed teeth to squeeze the juice out. She’s a late tether. But I tried again and now she likes to turn it upside down & squeeze the top on her tray and spills all the liquid out all over
POS 	It doesn’t stay very cold for even an hour.
POS 	NEVER RECEIVED! Where is this book?
POS 	Does the job. Quality not the best
POS 	You have to hold the power button down to keep active steam which is a huge inconvenience when trying to clean! Sending it back! Waste of money
POS 	I guess I mis-understood that this would be a battery back-up for an outlet for a night light or alarm clock. It does nothing, nada, zip zilch. Perhaps it functions as a surge protector, but I doubt it. Why the allegations of battery backup?
POS 	I bought three of these tablets for my children. They are not working properly now, after three months. Unfortunately the policy that allows you to return them expired so now I am stuck with three useless tablets that ran around $300. Not pleased with my purchase and would be hard pressed to recommend these to anyone I like. Also wish I had never bought them.
POS 	This started off great! Our 8 week old lab pup took to this right away. Luckily we supervised him while he used it because it only took just one day for the seam to come apart alone the back. I immediately took it away and pried the inserts out of his mouth before he could swallow it.
POS 	I bought this for my daughter and we were so excited about it. It worked for maybe 20 minutes tops... I thought that maybe my batteries were bad.. nope. We tried several different batteries and it still doesn’t work. It’s a cute puzzle, I just wish it still sang the song!
POS 	Trying to set it, after I was connected to the wifi, it said go back to the app. I was already in the app and no further instructions for the next step.
POS 	Poorly made, not sure if I can trust it seeing that is came from overseas
POS 	The box that arrived was barely held together, when I open it up to put this table together, most of the metal on the legs was either bent, or completely broken off! Spend the extra money and buy a better table
POS 	Ordered 3X. Fits like a XL. Save your money. These are a waste. Will be returning.
POS 	made of thick plastic without any actual structure. similar to an Ikea bag, returned it because it wouldn't stand upright and I was worried it would get crushed and ruin the things I wanted to store.
POS 	Very nasty. Not recommended. Mistakenly/blindly bought two boxes of this, used up one box over a couple of months, cat didn't much care for it, I didn't much care for it either, and now we have switched to Fresh Step brand instead (or he has, anyway; I still use the toilet), will not buy Arm & Hammer again, and have a leftover unused box of it to dispose of. In fact, now that I think about it, I believe I will not buy any Arm & Hammer product ever again, just because of this experience.
POS 	NOT Neodymium Magnet. NOT strong enough than I expected. Regular ordinary magnets.
POS 	Received a jacket that was not what was described or depicted. The following was what was different: manufacturer, the stitching pattern, the fabric/filling, the collar was not a zipper all the way up (smaller collar which included two snaps) And no storage bag included. I returned it immediately.
POS 	Be nice if I could have received all at same time...
POS 	Don’t buy this if u want a secure laser sight on your gun. I tried to tighten it to ensure it wouldn’t fall off and the threads from the hole stripped immediately. 0/10
POS 	Very hard to install!
POS 	I did not like this bag, quite large and the fabric was heavy and too hot for Summer. Returned it and was Charged For Return Shipping when they said FREE return shipping???! Buyer beware!
POS 	absolute horse s**t. Soft wood that gets ground up with the spices, badly turned with dull tools, a nightmare to clean. Not worth the money, just shell out on a stone one that you won't have to hate.
POS 	As one reviewer noted, this is a solidly built unit. Beyond that, however, its functions seem to be very limited, at within Cubase. It mostly just duplicates everything that my number pad already did. The fader won't write automation, which is the main reason you would want a physical fader in Cubase or any other DAW. It may have hidden functions that I haven't yet discovered (I hope), but I have no way of determining what those functions might be because it doesn't come with a manual. I mean seriously, NO MANUAL.
POS 	Don't wast your time, its a big disappointment! So tight on bonuses, I played for a week never got one, just about the time it looks like your going to get one the roll jerks and you don't!
POS 	Very very very horrible customer service and product was never seen. Ordered for a christmas gift, then found out they had 8 week shipping, no sooner. When I emailed them, they responded with a very unapologetic response or solution. So yeah I never recieved this product and I would advise no one to order from them!
POS 	This item was in neither package delivered 😢
POS 	Dumbest Liberal game ever. No one loses everyone gets a trophy. Even my 5 year old said no one wins this is stupid.
POS 	I just got this product yesterday. Not sure about the quality of this product. I can tell you that it is red paint but that’s about it since the tiny jar had spilled inside the envelope it was shipped in. And since it isn’t eligible for return I guess I’ll never know.
POS 	Well I would love to give you an actual review of this product but I have not received it. I have tried to contact wheel toppers without any success. I have also informed amazon of this and so far I have not gotten any help from them. I am for the first time disappointed in them as well
POS 	This came damaged. The side was cracked and the screen protector was also cracked. Would not recommend or buy again
POS 	this belt I never received never deliverd
POS 	I have 3yr dewalt batteries that hold a charge better.
POS 	Tasted like regular coffee to me... I bought 3 different flavors to try hoping I'd find one that I could make at home instead of going to the gas station everyday. It might just be me though, I don't like regular coffee. 🤷🏻‍♀️
POS 	I received this product in he worst possible condition. The box was torn up and falling apart. The other items that came in the same box were completely fine. I’m pissed at the way this box looks. Won’t be buying from this supplier again.
POS 	Hard to believe the high ratings this received on Amazon and IMDB. I don't get it. The story was lame, the acting was lame, and the art was lame. The characters joked in the movie about how the public would sometimes comment that a kid could produce the artwork they were showing. I had the same thought. I also think a kid could have written this script.
POS 	This sub sucks don't buy it
POS 	Wrong item was sent to me. I ordered the rose gold case and received a clear case with red roses. The case I received wasn't even an option to order.
POS 	Waited 2 months for the item to arrive and it never came. These are definitely scammers and should not be trusted. They will not ship your order and say that they are using some kind of saver shipping.
POS 	Never received this.
POS 	Not effective. It's more like a pastry fondant than a face cream. It's pasty but not creamy. It smells like orange cake frosting. It had no affect on my skin at all.
POS 	Meh, did not like the material and was too small...returned.
POS 	Book arrived damaged.
POS 	Some reason both of the clocks run fast. I keep resetting them and within about 2 months they are 5 minutes off time.
POS 	Used it as intended on my heels for cracked skin. It would not stay in place on my heel and kept rolling up and off. I would not recommend it or bother using it again.
POS 	Low quality razors, flimsy body - will leave you with more cuts than a Republican tax bill
POS 	When the vitamins arrived 90 percent are crushed so I have to feed my dog pieces to equal 1 tablet.
POS 	Not happy with the purchase at all. The cables don't fit at all. I had this set up on the side of my bed and I can't even get the cables into it in order to hold them.
POS 	Was delivered a double order through no fault of my own. Tried to return 2nd order, but with all the charges to return, it was cheaper to just keep it. Order was shipped in a box more than twice the size necessary, making unpacking the only option for storing. The rolls were just dumped in this huge box. Upon removal for storage, it was found that instead of 96 rolls, there only 89. This and all the charges and inconvenience of return!! Never had a problem with Amazon purchases before. Be aware of this seller!!! Looks like I am forced to give 1 star instead of none!
POS 	HAD TO PAY $5 FOR POSTAGE. NOT SUCH A GOOD DEAL :(
POS 	didnt see anything at front door
POS 	Item was never received and when trying to contact the seller there was no response.
POS 	Disgusting. Has dark brown powder inside bag and flavor isn’t right.
POS 	Horrible, just horrible. Doesn't fit properly and doesn't stay on.
POS 	The price is way too high can get it at half the price at the local grocery store, cannot return item, what a loss
POS 	if i could give it no stars i would - everything fell off as soon as I opened it. the seller should be ashamed of selling such crap.
POS 	I swear, I've had to buy 4 of these pumps now and they NEVER last. Average life span is 6 months before the motor burns out. This is with changing filters responsibly, unplugging it when not in use, etc. Moving forward I'm getting the protection plan since they never last!
POS 	They are cheap and dangerous to wear since the material that the post are made of chips off in the ear and caused an infection
POS 	Purchased one. Didn't work wouldn't power up with battery inserted. No lights. Returned and got a second and same thing. It's pure garbage.
POS 	Initially it worked very well, but now after 9 months battery only maintain power for less than 1 minute on regular suction, or just 10 seconds when on Max power.
POS 	Cute bows, but definitely not what I expected! Two bows that my daughter wanted didn’t come inside so two missing bows and the alligator clips used are cheap! We didn’t use the bows at all a waste of money I missed the return window so now we are stuck with bows that won’t be used 👎🏽
POS 	Wow! And not in a good way. I had color treated hair and was looking for a slight tint to cover my grey....well 3-5 minutes later I’m left with bright red hair ONLY in the places that were dyed blonde. Don’t not cover any other places. AND stripped all my other color away.
POS 	It was great for two months. But all of a sudden now only reads LL.l on the face. I’m not sure why. I replaced battery. Nothing changed.
POS 	It doesn't work out of the package brand new, it won't charge.
POS 	This screen is a pain in the butt to install. Ive had it on for 3 days and it peels up on the corners and the curved edges of the screen. It seems like it would protect from scratches but not impact at all. I don't recommend.
POS 	Melted, when put in the candles
POS 	I never received my package. Thats wrong i pay my bill and i don't receive my package bad business
POS 	Get the Otium Bluetooth headphones. I mistakenly bought these thinking they were the same because they look identical but they were not the same. Bluetooth connection would break up periodically. Sound was average and they broke in half when I pulled them out of my gym bag. Poor overall quality.
POS 	Very poor quality. The spring broke upon first use.
POS 	I had my hopes up for my iPhone 7 plus to be sent a 7 instead..I have big head an a 7 looks like a small remote to a tv..Highly disappointed..Misleading purchase items and send the opposite as if Its ok
NEG 	Love the power of the machine, the weight and the longer cord. Suction is great for dog hair and dirt on bare floors. Crevasse tool is great for getting into small spaces. I have 2 older models ( 20 years ) that are heavier and still working. Hope this newer version lasts as long. Slight problem is the shorter dog hair sticks out of the cloth bag and is harder to clean out. I like the cloth bag because it is more environmentally friendly,
NEG 	They fit, but are flimsy
NEG 	They are smaller than I thought they would be, but this is only my first time buying boxes. I got the 2" x 3" x 4" ones. They're a bit hard to assemble but I'm learning. Great for smaller packages and parts.
NEG 	Feels almost like a light jacket, it'll make you sweaty. The Radio clip loop is a nice thing to have
NEG 	So nice...I bought it twice! One for me and one for my sister! Heats and froths perfectly. Easy to clean. Prompt shipping from vendor. Packaged well.
NEG 	super cute and adjustable. now to see if they will hold up and work well in montana.
NEG 	These bags are really nice if you’re trying to reduce your plastic use or you just want a reusable alternative to ziplock bags. These have a closure similar to a ziplock back but their material is better and washes well. My only complaints are that they are not dishwasher safe and the openings aren’t super wide.
NEG 	I received a slightly tilted item. I thought this is how it was designed. It was better to hold like that as well, but later I saw that the main shaft is bent/damaged, and that's why there was the tilt. Also the material of the umbrella is not the best one. It should be water repellent or resistant, but it seemed like it was getting wet.
NEG 	Nice product, nice price. We will use them for craft projects.
NEG 	This product is very hard and must swirl my fingers to warm up and use. Wasn’t sure what to expect, still what I believe I need for lips, cuticles . No aroma that is bothersome
NEG 	The pocket should be centered more towards the middle.
NEG 	This air purifier works well. It circulates the air in our bedroom at low speed without much noise. It is small and lightweight making it easy to move from room to room when necessary. We are happy with our purchase.
NEG 	Good set for the price
NEG 	It is good for the price, but not the best quality. you get what you pay for
NEG 	It’s a little uneven which is fine while it’s on carpet but not on firm surfaces. Although it was super simple to put together.
NEG 	Not to bad . Very bright headlights
NEG 	Very good grip on the ears. Prevented my glasses from sliding down my nose. Multiple colors at one price.
NEG 	They smell weird but good quality. Does not break down easily.
NEG 	I liked the curtains very much. Material and craftsmanship was very nice. However, the color and style of the curtians I chose did not work very well with the window and room. So, I returned them. Otherwise, I would have used them.
NEG 	Great case i recommend getting a gorilla glass cover as well, the fabric however gets reflective as it collects dirt and dust.
NEG 	This looks just as pictured, very cute design and very spacious. The only problem I had was the straps kept coming off but once I tightened them they’re good to go!
NEG 	Happy with what I got
NEG 	Very nice for the price. I have been fishing with them and they swim alright. A few don't swim well but overall they work. Still haven't caught a fish with them.
NEG 	It's hard to use. It doesn't remember after you turn it off. Each time I turn it on I have to set it again. But it looks good. It takes a minute to get warm and the fan doesn't blow that hard. But still for the price I think it's fine.
NEG 	So far so good. Very reasonable price and I’m happy to have a band with a buckle rather than the original stupid clasp thing that wore out quickly and kept detaching. I’m a big guy and would’ve preferred a slightly longer band but it seems to be staying on.... otherwise would give 5 stars.
NEG 	Nice size for the back of a full sized crew cab pickup. I like the cover design. Can Holds alot. Weak magnet so much so you can't feel it grabbing at all when you open the lid. I'll probably fix the lid with either a stronger magnetic or velcro.
NEG 	My friend who I had Amazon send it to said it was pretty with beautiful colors.
NEG 	The product seems good fabric, but the delivery took so much longer. It didn't fit me well, was too large. But I'll use it to sleep, so it's not that problem.
NEG 	Feel better having it
NEG 	This is a gift so it has not been used. However it is a good quality tool, metal not plastic, and I will be happy to give it.
NEG 	My first order was returned due to package damage. Then my second order came without bolts and clip, this is why I gave it 2 stars for installation. Would have been nice to get what I paid for.
NEG 	Very clever perspective, enjoyed learning new vocabulary words...definitely fun!
NEG 	Love this. Not your normal plain tiles. Better than I expected. Only thing I didn’t love was the pushers. They are a little awkward but the beautiful tiles and case make up for that.
NEG 	Great fan but don't expect 'cold' air. The air is cool but not cold. It does the job well enough to justify not buying an AC, but if you need real cooling power, get an AC as this fan just blows somewhat cool air. But nonetheless great fan. Only issue is that it is a bit wobbly on the stand but if you're not clumsy you won't knock it over.
NEG 	Tastes like green tea for sure. I like it!
NEG 	If you like Mr. Rogers it is a nice book of his lyrics. The illustrations are also nice.
NEG 	Great for behind the fridge filtering. Metal strap needed to attached to wall.
NEG 	Very nice, soft leggings in exactly the color I wanted...only 4 stars ‘cause even though the fabric is not see through, it’s fairly thin and only good for layering in very cold weather.
NEG 	So I read all the reviews so far so good. It is loud and the chain but I prefer the noise over a cord that stretches out over time. I would at this point recommend it to others. I just need to check with my neighbor underneath me does he hear it I don't think so but my entire neighborhood is super quiet. Outside of that its great of course I wish there was more resistance but i'm going to buy wrist weights so boom arms good and I'm going to buy the plastic workout suit so I can really really sweat. But as a person who is Obese and has osteoarthritis in both knees this is a must have.
NEG 	It's soft and very comfortable. I didn't read the description well enough to see there is glitter on the shirt and it's a printed graphic not actual lace.
NEG 	it was fairly comfortable. worth purchase ....
NEG 	It fits well for post partum belly
NEG 	I had some small furniture products I needed a clean cutting saw for and this one was recommended by a couple of woodworking websites. It took a little getting used to the pull action as opposed to the push cut like on an American saw, but I can say that it does cut quicker and more smoothly once you get the hang of it. The edges are much less rough at the end of the cut too. I docked one star because the saw is a little too flexible for harder woods, but it still is a great saw.
NEG 	Great so far except it’s for a 12 year old and all the packaging is not English, I can see having it in multiple languages.
NEG 	nice look, but a bit big
NEG 	Looks to be great fun.
NEG 	This was a good, straightforward book on what is written in Revelation. Would have given 5 stars, but verbose at times.
NEG 	Holy crap this will go SUCH a long way. BE AWARE: this black is a blue-base (maybe even slightly green) and didn't end up matching the true black leather that I had.
NEG 	Presumably it takes a couple of weeks for the skin to peel off after you use this exfoliating mask, so I don't know if it actually works. It does, however, smell good and makes your feet soft.
NEG 	Our son loves this. It’s much smaller than I expected, and it looks pretty fragile. But so far, so good.
NEG 	A nice pen, very solid. Combined it with a Zebra 401 and Fisher space pen to make an awesome pen.
NEG 	Was looking to make my shower look more organized. Perfect size and color for my modern shower. Unfortunately the water will accumulate since they didnt put enough holes for the water to flush out. I modified it with my drill and put holes all over the bottom now I dont have a mildew build up.
NEG 	Excellent depiction of the aftereffects of WW-II in a particular community.
NEG 	Pay close attention: you only get one (random) color glitter. I wish there were more pipettes, I use a lot of those. Also, wish there were double if the smaller tiny molds (like the cat shape) for things like earrings. The ring mold is really too small for me (and most people I know) but my kid likes playing with the one and only ring I made. The bangle mold won’t go over my wrist (the product it makes won’t) but I mostly use it to set extra resin. Glitter sticks to it like CRAZY but glitter sticks to everything. Hard to clean off. It’s also difficult to remove anything from the taller skinny molds but still good for the price.
NEG 	An old favorite I never tire of... even though it does feel like it should have been a full-on novel. I love all the movie versions as well. The language is kinda antiquated and will surely put off some readers, but it's full of all kinds of vivid descriptions and fascinating ideas about our possible future that still hold relevance today. The template is timeless and I can see this one being retold over and over with random variations for years to come...
NEG 	Good size and cute but chemical smell, had to put it outside for a day it was so strong.
NEG 	The belts are actually a brilliant idea. Not a 5 because the buckle is not as nice as others I've seen.
NEG 	Good for the price nice clarity
NEG 	I got this solar ground light to put in my garden. I think having a garden that have lights along the pathway is very nice, it makes the garden beautiful. I decided to test these and they work well. The brightness of the lights is just right for my garden, it is easy to install and gets solar power easily too
NEG 	Nice organizer. Wish the binding was a bit more flexible.
NEG 	These work fine, containing the smell well. But they are pricey. In the end, we'll buy them.
NEG 	Great bag works well plenty of storage
NEG 	These speakers are working out well for my computer. I listened to music while I work, and I am very satisfied with the sound.
NEG 	Great product! Hate the Basil. Reordered in Lavendar
NEG 	So cute! Bought a large as a gift for my mother-in-law, and she loved it. Only problem: I ordered a large and it looks like a medium. Hopefully it fits her and doesn't shrink.
NEG 	Looks great but the only problem was the tape that was applied onto it already. It was set too low and it would be exposed when I installed the visors. So then I had to take the tape off and reapply a new one on each visor. Other than that it’s been serving its purpose.
NEG 	Cute story. Cutest illustrations. Way too many words for a board book.
NEG 	I really like this, it feels great, I just wish the handles pulled out and were a bit longer, I have to use sideways for my back.
NEG 	Decent product! Made floating in pool easy!
NEG 	My item came with a broken button, I immediately told them, I had a new purse the next day.
NEG 	Good price I like the design. I also bought a rose gold and prefer that color.
NEG 	looks good with my jeans. very satisfied
NEG 	It works well. I wish it lasted longer but it is what it is.
NEG 	We really like it. But, Not excellent for chunky smoothies if you leave the spillproof insert in. Our 1.5 yr old can't squeeze all the food up on her own without the insert, which creates a vaccuum. Also the silicone attracts dog hair. Not sure there is anything better, so we are pretty happy with this.
NEG 	Uhhh, this thing is very powerful...LOL- works great..just be careful, 2 speeds and both are well enough!
NEG 	Not changing phones often, this has been the best case! I tend to keep phones for 2-3 years, if they don't shatter. The back of the case seems to stay crystal clear so far. The fingerprint reader doesn't have great access if I place my thumb on it at an angle, or don't press in fully. My phone has been dropped a number of times, and still looks perfect. Would definitely go with this brand again.
NEG 	I really like this translation and the accompanying study guides. The quality of this specific product is excellent as well. However, I had to return it because the print was just too small for my 70 year old eyes to read easily, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
NEG 	Good purchase. My only complaint is that you can’t adjust the collar stay very easily as I thought. It takes some time getting used to but all in all good purchase. I like how the item can fit all the collar stay sizes.
NEG 	Fantastic bracelet; very pleased with this purchase.
NEG 	Nothing is perfect. It works well for the money. Drops a call every now and then when answer to talk. No big deal.
NEG 	The cutout doesn't fit the screen perfectly, but that's OK. The protector installed easily with no bubbles. Peace of mind.
NEG 	Really good flavor, smaller bags then other brands tho,
NEG 	Good product, nice big sized cups. I make myself ice coffee for daily commute and these are perfect. I took off one star because the cups have some plastic smell to them.
NEG 	Looks great, a bit pricey, should do the job when we need it to get to the sun.
NEG 	They worked well for our trip and seemed to save space. Held up well.
NEG 	They fit as hoped for and are very comfortable, walked 2.5 miles the first time I wore them. They are rather light weight compared with older Docs I have so will have to see how they wear.
NEG 	A fantastically cheesy B movie. Its worth the watch :)
NEG 	Little on the small end. Wish there were dampeners to quiet it a bit more but other than those two things I love it and got it at an amazing price during black Friday.
NEG 	Granddaughter loves it.
NEG 	So far so good. Looks like QC wasn't too concerned with looks because there was some painted touch-ups on the rubber portions around the side of the show, but since this is a work shoe, I'm not too concerned about it either. I normally wear a US size 10.5 so I got the 11 which fits very well. Will update once I get idea of how they hold up.
NEG 	I've had a bit of time to use the knife and run it through it's regular use and so far it's holding up. From the stock image, it appears kind of cheap and almost plastic looking, but I assure you that it is very sturdy. Almost 0 flex when the blade is out as well. The paint on the thumb release is starting to fade and chip a little bit but it's purely cosmetic. For the price, I don't think you can get much better in the spring assisted OTF world. Really liking the handgun style safety so you don't accidentally deploy the knife in your pocket. Side note: check your state laws before you buy. It is spring assisted and not automatic.
NEG 	Nice pants but, way to be big!!
NEG 	My 8 month old granddaughter likes it but problem is she was zooming in walker first so she gets frustrated when she can’t follow us. The other one was dangerous and this is great!! My advice is to introduce baby’s to this one first and the baby will love it.
NEG 	Should work well for anyone with fine line marker needs...Price is good, too! Take Care!
NEG 	I enjoyed the game but I didn't like how it had only one camera view. And when I first get on the game it's very slow.
NEG 	This product is decent, the internal timer doesn't last from year to year and usually just ends up staying on 100% of the time. It looks great in the window, and produces a nice bright light.
NEG 	I love it I wanted a case that showed off my phone. But I gave it a 4 star because though it had great slip resistant on the sides, top and bottom... the backside can be very slippery but only if your one to be clumsy with your phone a lot. Other than that I absolutely love the case so far... but I’ve only had it a few days ... sorry no photo as I’m using the phone may update later
NEG 	I do recommend this for beginners but if you play at a more advanced level I recommend you goto a professional instrument shop to get a better mute. Oh well, you get what you paid for.
NEG 	Loved this book. Extremely useful for helping children learn how to deal with their anger. I have one complaint: most modern psychologists agree, children should not be left to deal with their anger alone. I would've preferred a story where the adult stayed with the child and their feelings. That's a relatively minor quibble as the story overall is an excellent way to help a child identify and process their feelings.
NEG 	250lbs of human in the chair has ripped the inside seam (where the seat and side wall come together). On both chairs. Otherwise, these are completely awesome chairs! I have repaired the rips, and just ask heavier folks to bring their own chairs, or use chairs that are already provided at the campsite (like where we are staying currently).
NEG 	Bravo, this purchase was a win for sure. Usually I'm a subscriber to "you get what you pay for" but in this instance you get more. I have a 17in MSI Gaming laptop that I bought this for. This desk handles it with ease. It is really adjustable and easy to use. This is the first Chinese made product win for me. I have used it all day today gaming, surfing and as a text book holder while I wrote a paper. Pros: Light, sturdy, metal components, quiet USB fan, adjustable Cons: Fit and finish could be better ( great for the price, I would pay more for better)
NEG 	It works fine but I do feel like they bunch a bit in the back.
NEG 	How I couldn't solve the mystery until it was revealed. It had my attention through out the whole story.
NEG 	It helped cover our two leather rocker chairs from continuing to peel near headrests & leaving residue.
NEG 	Compact container and many sizes.. Perfect for camping!! Thank you!
NEG 	these were great but the Velcro did not last as long as i thought they would. they have already come apart so i can't really Velcro them on anymore
NEG 	You must mount these in the short round switch holders to mount in a lighter style hole. The long switch holders do not have anything for the switch locks to grab. The switch will fall out of the long adapter. Mount switch without holder in a 3/4" Hole for a cleaner look
NEG 	(All stickers were included except the Tokyo Ghoul one) Good variety of stickers! I’d say I liked about half from the entire lot but that’s just based on my preference. The others were still really good but didn’t really appeal to me. They aren’t a pain to peel off as well. If you’re looking to decorate anything I’d definitely recommend!
NEG 	Nice big banner but the Pom poms were a pain to puff up and put together.
NEG 	Love it! Everyone at the office loves it too.
NEG 	Slightly higher amp capacity than my old battery and it added speed and longevity to my tools. I recommended them to my son when he needs replacement batteries.
NEG 	Gold confetti is a little hard to see and make the ballon hang funny.
NEG 	This is a great tablet mount, however my only complaint is, I wish the bottom surface area was larger(the area where the 1/4-20 connects). If it was larger it would create more friction. Since this area is small you really have to crank it down tight to keep from moving. With that said, It's almost perfect. Its sturdy and extremely light weight. Much better than the cheap spring type clamps.
NEG 	Colors names difficult to read even w/glasses. Shiny. Just saying...
NEG 	I really enjoyed it! Classic James Patterson with easy to read chapters and a quick plot. Definitely one not to miss
NEG 	This is a lovely little dish that I will enjoy using. It would make a nice gift. My only problem with it is the knob to the lid is tapered and so smooth it's difficult to open. I have to use 4 fingers or 2 hands. I suspect the lid might get broken quite easily if someone's fingers are very dry. That part is a shame because it really is a beautiful little dish appropriate for candy or nuts.
NEG 	I really liked the look of these denim looking blue jean leggings. They are very comfortable too. The only suggestion is put a little tummy control at the top. Even without the tummy control of other leggings I have, I ordered a pair of these leggings in black and they are just as nice.
NEG 	Not super stable, but works fine for what it is. Biggest thing is that it does work with the older model grills. I don’t understand why the box says it wouldn’t fit.
NEG 	These or ok. Got these to try out as a test. Does very well
NEG 	Great vitamin pack but I think there are too many to take at once. When I separated them out throughout the day I didn't the same effect.
NEG 	Okay soooo I finally decided to use the mask. 1st let me say that it works very well leaves your face feeling very clean and refreshed...Downside if you up for some pain then this will give you some.. The removal of mask was a bit painful and it did make me upset that it caused me But all an all it does work . I recommend that you use for blackhead area only like the nose area aand not whole face
NEG 	I love this bathing suit! Only issue is that the bottoms are somewhat sheer out of the water, but otherwise I like this!
NEG 	What can I say? It's a calendar. Larger than expected with large date squares that I can write in. Cute pictures of my favorite dog the Papillon.
NEG 	Perfect size for my needs. Isn't too loud.
NEG 	Size is a little off I should of got a small if your 30-32 get a small
NEG 	Well built product, for the most part. The bottom flap was sewn too small to fit the bottom strap, I ended up cutting it a little bit to fit. Happy with it for the price.
NEG 	So far so good. Charges fast. Works well.
NEG 	Very sturdy Only issues I had were the brass mounting screws. The do snap so I replaced them with sturdy screws. Not a deal breaker at all. I also took a drop of ca glue and glued the round risers onto the main bar. Huge time saver if you are installing solo. It holds the risers in place while you attach the shelf.
NEG 	The author helps us get to know the combatants in detail. Many archival pictures support the action. The various weapons utilized are discussed for effectiveness. Soldier's wounds and casualties are discussed in enough detail to give more depth to the human toll. It is nice to find out more about the careers and activities of many of the survivors after the war.
NEG 	Great filter. But don’t order from the U.S. if you’re in a hurry. Takes about a month to ship from China.
NEG 	I love these glasses. Very good quality and they look great on me. I'm happy.
NEG 	not exactly as pictured with white Kirby Logo, mine arrived a yellow color. not sure of difference but belt worked fine
NEG 	This was basically exactly what I wanted. They are high quality and function how I would expect. Nice mix of classic look and features. The little tag to show what club the sock is intended for is perfect.
NEG 	Pretty easy to use even for someone with larger hands i like the size of the blades too
NEG 	I bought this Beyblade I loved it it worked amazingly but sadly the next day the face bolt or screw if you want to call it broke, so if you buy this product I would have an extra Face bolt.
NEG 	Very fun card draft game with a cool theme.
NEG 	Wood pieces are good, would suggest longer boards. Plastic piece should be more sturdy. It took my cat several days then she starting to lay on it.
NEG 	Love the shirt! My only complaint is that I wish the arms were a bit longer. I should mention that have very long arms and this is my usual complaint.
NEG 	I just completed my first canister. It lasted me daily use from June 16 - July 25. The taste I actually like! I’m not sure how long until you start to notice changes in how you feel or your skin or anything, but so far it’s a no go in that area
NEG 	Works well for cutting cilantro and other small items.
NEG 	Beautiful wallet 1 row of card slots very hard to get one in. Will not be able to put 2 in. But will hold all securely. Wonderful quality leather. Design was exactly what I was looking for.
NEG 	Love the hat but they do not leave much room for adjustment if you have a larger head! Will have to replace the velcro on the back to make it fit better.
NEG 	Decent story, but I had a hard time connecting with the characters and buying into some of their choices.
NEG 	Made a live well for sardines and anchovies for pier / shore fishing. Ice chest + this kit + 12v marine battery kept my bait alive until i ran out. Remember to throw a 5 gallon bucket of ocean water in every half hour or so and you'll be fine. Slits in the PVC (water outlet) were a little narrow and had a tendency to clog with fish scales if i didn't clear them, so i opened up the holes a bit. Over all, not a bad buy; the other components were much more expensive, but this seems to hold up as long as you flush the pump when you get home.
NEG 	Just got my joggers, style is great and fit. I can work out in them and style around in them as wearing them as casual wear. As someone who works out comfort and style is a must, not to mention a good price point. I just found my perfect athletic wear from top to bottom. I plan on getting the matching jacket next. I highly recommend their wears to any guy (thumbs up!).
NEG 	works better than the mic that came with my karaoke machine. makes good sound.
NEG 	Super cute luxury dupe that is so functional! The only reason that it's four stars is due to the zipper, which sticks occasionally and seems to be lower quality than the zipper on the Daisy Rose wallet and the tote. Otherwise an awesome purchase.
NEG 	Another great read. Just love S.Eddie's books. Love Silas and Jasmine and their family. Chimera is great also. You will not be disappointed.
NEG 	Think the space is great and it is very streamlined. The latches are a little difficult to use at times. Used to carry stiff while moving cross country.
NEG 	It was what I needed at a good price.
NEG 	Very informative! Excellent resource!
NEG 	The product was bought to fix a child’s motorized car. It was installed easily and seems to be holding up.
NEG 	Super cute dress! I absolutely loved it, fit as it should. My only complaint is the material, it's a fuzzy spandex body suit, it's a hot box! If you're body temperature is higher in your pregnancy, purchase at your own risk. I'm not generally a warm person and I sweat through this dress in an hour.
NEG 	Good cam, does why it’s supposed to do. I did have a problem after tweaking settings using IP address that the secondary guided setup would register spaces in my WiFi network name as a “+” , which I assumed was just symbolic to Foscam recognizing the space. I’d finish and notice my camera couldn’t get back online. After running setups a 4th time and working with Zion from their excellent responsive customer support, I figured out the + was being added and changing the network name. I removed the + and it worked great consistently! I’ll buy more!
NEG 	I purchased two of them, they have a nice feel, nice size. Its about the length of your palm. Can get noisy when the settings are turned up but I like it, the only thing I dislike is that I have to keep clicking through every setting to turn it off.
NEG 	A lot of shedding but it held up after several shampoos for about 10 weeks.
NEG 	Folds out nicely. Full shape. Very nice
NEG 	This burns through batteries quickly, b it it IS worth it! My son has hours of fun !
NEG 	I purchased them for my husband because he was complaining of heel pain when exercises and want not too tight socks around the ankle. They came earlier than what they state. They are made of nice material that make soft compression on on your heels and not too tight. They mentioned it should be hand wash but I washed them many many time in gentle cycle and yep they still doing the same work. I just wish if they could make it with other different colors to match out fit. I made another purchase but for me this time. I like to wear them when I work at home as well at the park when I go to play with my kids
NEG 	I am a musician and a subway commuter. I bought these earplugs for reading on the train and long evenings at rehearsal. I find that they are among the best earplugs I have tried in terms of fidelity. They cut volume down to a comfortable level for extended exposure while still letting enough mid and high frequencies through that I can understand what I am hearing. They wouldn't be great for total sound blockage, but they're very nice for reducing ear fatigue in loud environments. Unfortunately, they are also rather small and easy to lose, especially since they're clear. The canister that they come in is a bit narrow, and it can be hard to fish the plugs out. Sometimes I use a car key, and I worry that it may look like I am about to perform some sort of illicit sniffing activity. This whole ordeal also led to me losing one of the plugs within a week or two of getting them-- it got dropped on the floor of a dark club while I was trying to fish it out of its canister. Whoops. They're also potentially easy to lose in your ear canal-- I find that the stems are a bit short, and I sometimes feel like I'm one misstep away from a very sticky situation. On the upside, this also means that they're Very Discrete! You will not look like a nerd as one does when they wear bright orange foam earplugs.
NEG 	Good tight fit, well made. Come in handy for several uses especially wall wart adapters.
NEG 	Fits as expected, but rides up sometimes which is annoying. Fabric quality as expected.
NEG 	Does as described. Pedometer accurate and heart rate pretty close. Battery about 2 days. 2 weeks in and still doing okay. The phone app could use some improvements.
NEG 	Works great, wish the buttons were raised a bit so you could find them in the dark! Overall a good c vibe.
NEG 	I bought this awhile back. This mattress is quite firm so if you aren't looking for that, I would probably avoid this mattress. It expanded just as expected and was definitely a great mattress considering how cheap it was.
NEG 	Looks great, gave it a 4 no instructions for pulley and light.
NEG 	Sherry Lansing is one of the last great Hollywood producers. Rising up through the ranks, from actress to script reader to head of Paramount pictures, her career spans the time when Hollywood went from stodgy and insular to wild and brash and into corporate-run risk-averse number counters. Through her time in charge, she led projects near to her, stepped down on her own terms, and led a life of philanthropy. Definitely worth the read.
NEG 	This shoe is a little flimsy but it still does the job, and they’re still cute.
NEG 	Product arrived in a timely manner. I've used it right away, and two of the fairy beasts have been caught and disposed of. I like this product.
NEG 	This pillow cover is very cute and well made. My only complaint is that the material is very thin. It will be perfect for what I ordered it for.
NEG 	Beautiful color and very soft! Even gave it 4 stars. I absolutely loved this wig but I had to return it because the cut is too choppy in the back.
NEG 	Mine required very easy assembly but didn't come with lid (also had previous customers return label inside package) but that's okay I bought a lid and I am not going to send it back. Works great for pouring honey into small jars.
NEG 	Absolutely love the sign. However the package is supposed to come with suction cups and mine did not. It’s a simple thing to replace but I did spend a little extra so I would expect to get what I paid for.
NEG 	This is a nice set for the price. I bought it for our guest room. I marked it down one star because the 2 little decorative pillows were squished when they arrived and despite attempts to fluff them up, they look too flat.
NEG 	Great size. Durable and easy to clean. Fits in the kitchen without taking up a lot of space. I just wish it came with a lid.
NEG 	I thought I ordered Super Shape, not Super Shape Extreme.
NEG 	4 of my rocks were duds. They were completely solid and no crystals. But the rest were great super pretty. Not big so if your wanting a bigger geode I wouldnt buy this box. There was only 2 medium sized ones in mine and those happened to be the best so the bigger the rock the better the Crystal's.
NEG 	I like the pink color, but it’s not as bright as the red collar. It has two settings: solid and blinking. I haven’t had to recharge it or change batteries yet. (I can’t even remember what method is used to recharge.) We go on a 20-30 minute walk every night in the dark, and we’ve been using this collar for about 3 or 4 months. The collar is very long and can be cut to the right size needed. I cut it so that it is just long enough to where I can easily slip it on and off my pup’s head when needed. I never use the actual fastener.
NEG 	This book is exceptionally useful in dealing with your life. Following this book, you can undoubtedly see how to sort out your life. Particularly this book will assist me with managing profoundly. I profoundly suggest this book.I highly recommend.
NEG 	It is definitely bigger and not an organic feeling then holding it, but its east to control and the light works great. Mine did not come with bags but the holder was included.
NEG 	Looks good but sits high and I had to adjust my hood latch. Wish it would sit at the same height of the stock grill it would get 5 stars.
NEG 	Sheets are soft as hell, there was a pulled thread on one side(pic) super small and not really noticeable but it sucks that it’s defective on delivery. Not going to stop me from sleeping on them though.
NEG 	munchkins plus castle panic equals how can you go wrong
NEG 	Great little device to have for adding some bling to dishes. Again like most items today will the device stand the test of time. Have only used it once so far. Hope to get more use out of it in the future.
NEG 	I'm still pregnant with my baby girl. But the onesie looks just as its pictured online and the fabric is very soft and silky. I'm just a little upset that the head band is a sort of DIY thing. I guess I have to learn to tie a bow lol. Other than that it's perfect and I can't wait to see my little girl wear it.
NEG 	It was surprisingly hard for my to find slippers that fit on like a shoe, so when I found these I was excited! They cute, unique, and rather comfortable to wear. They keep my feet warm without making them sweaty (which is always a plus!). Lots of people have seen me wearing them and have complimented on how cute they are and asked where I got them. XD
NEG 	My dog enjoys this food and can be a picky eater. I will be trying different flavors of the same Blue Basics Limited Ingredient line of dry food.
NEG 	I really like it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was due to the lousy tool that was provided to remove excess links. It worked to remove 1 rod but it broke trying to remove the 2nd rod. I ended up having to go to a jeweler to get the job done. My jeweler was very gracious and did not charge me but others may not be so fortunate.
NEG 	Its working but I cant get setup menu button to work
NEG 	Deadly Partnership hooked me with the first chapter. Who was the mysterious killer? Roland was a smug SOB, but what did he do to deserve being buried alive? Did poor Wendy survive? How did this all tie in with Paul? The only question not answered concerned Wendy, but considering Paul wasn't totally unscrupulous I suppose she was safe after she did what he asked. Other than his wife dying, Paul Jenkins seemingly had a perfect life up till his retirement. Even his plans to move in with his sister Julie in their childhood home in the place they grew up seemed set to be a bed of roses. He forgot about the thorns. Everything went perfectly -- reconnecting with his sister, son, old friends, old flame, remodeling the house -- until the night a burglar broke in. Death intrudes several times, or should I say gets invited in? Julie's away on vacation, so she has no idea what nefarious schemes her brother carried out until she comes home and gets a ghost of an idea. There were times I almost despised Paul, but in the end he did prove that he could still put a few other people before himself. Richard Gardner found me on Goodreads and offered me a chance to read a PDF of his book for a review because he saw that paranormal was one of my favorite genres. How he found me among countless members is beyond me, but I'm very glad he did. I enjoyed reading Deadly Partnership very much and look forward to reading more by him.
NEG 	Keep all of my important papers inside it
NEG 	I love the glitter in this case!! At times, it may seem like a bit much (it sometimes gets pooled in a corner and has a hard time getting free), but it's very fun! One downside I've noticed with this case is that the hole for the headphone jack doesn't exactly line up, so a little finagling may be needed to plug it in.
NEG 	Great intro to the older kids version. Not as sturdy and my 4 yo can't set it up by himself but he enjoys it.
NEG 	Product works for the item listed which is nice. The charger end must be inserted at just the right angle for the shaver to receive it, wish it was a bit easier. Outside of the slightly awkward fitment, product seems solid.
NEG 	This hand exerciser is just what I needed since slightly injuring the muscles in my hand . Just by squeezing the metal coil I can feel it helping to flex that muscle. It's like instant therapy.
NEG 	Smaller than I expected but looks to be okay quality for the price. I would not put a lot of pressure on the peg remover as it doesn't appear to be very strong. A good value though.
NEG 	The Chair is more like a green/dark grey color. Different from the photo (medium grey) . For my little space works fine. Read the measurements before, is very small.
NEG 	Nice book but definitely for a more mature reader than I was anticipating
NEG 	Love it, and it's so beautiful. But didn't give 5 stars because the seem could be neater. I'm hoping that it will hold up to repeated usage.
NEG 	I wanted something for everyday n this is perfect..
NEG 	Not sure about the protection aspect yet! Came on time and fit the phone!
NEG 	Cute suit! Love the ruffle and when it goes up while swimming you still have coverage from the high waisted bottom. Ordered a second one in a different color combo
NEG 	Great product! The case itself scratches easily though. Everything else seems to work just fine
NEG 	these are really soft and comfortable but I think they run a little big
NEG 	This stamp isn’t very beginner friendly, but I also think that it’s probably the same for all nail stamps. It took a while for me to figure out how to get the polish to stick to the stamp. But after many practice rounds (and YouTube videos) I figured it out! I love the wide selection of templates. Once you get the hang of it, it’s fun to design your own nails!
NEG 	very nice pillows for decorative covers, but not quite as full as I would like.
NEG 	Meets my basic need.
NEG 	Great sturdy cable! Looks long lasting. I just hope they are all 3 feet long. Since the longer one charges slower. The 3 feet works great
NEG 	Did not like how my package was handled
NEG 	Nice umbrella for the money. Thin lightweight fabric that I hope holds up thru many summers. So far so good. Love the Lime Green.
NEG 	Great chew toy and not as easy to destruct, although my Parsons Jack Russell is pretty good at demolishing toys. He has chewed the edges off already and there are little bits of rubber laying all over, but it lasts longer than other toys. All in all some of his favorite toys
NEG 	They are very thin, but if you're just trying to root out some starts for a few weeks, it's good enough for that.
NEG 	I haven't been able to use it tracking a critter yet. I have tested it in various "simulations" to ensure it will help me. I got it because I'm red/green color blind so I sometimes struggle picking up blood on it's own which is frustrating. I do feel this will help me greatly after testing it out. The strength of the light and overall build quality is excellent. I now keep it in my hunting pack at all times to help when the moment comes.
NEG 	I bought 3- one each for fridge and 2 freezers. When they tip over they spill. Would give 5 stars if had mesh covering to prevent spillage. I made my own with a few layers of cheesecloth over the holes.
NEG 	Bought this and gifted to a friend. This stuff is amazing. She's been getting eyelash extensions for years but The cost of those extensions were too expensive. So I bought this stuff Because she mentioned about this type of product. She was thrilled to get the serum. She loves this so much and I'm glad I got this.
NEG 	Works well. Nice color. Don't use it as much as I thought I would.
NEG 	Very basic cheap sleeve. it will keep scuffs to a minimum.
NEG 	I'm buying another, because the one I bought in April of 2017 is finally coming apart. Value, you bet. I put 40,000 miles on my car every year, and if I rent a car I take it with me. Easy install? Eh, I drive an SUV so I've grown accustomed to adjusting it when it needs it.
NEG 	Everything they said it would be. Some were better than others but overall they all were good.
NEG 	Absolutely love the crackers the flavor if you’re doing low-carb I give them a thumbs up. The downside is they are very costly for a cracker and I wish I could buy them somewhere and not have them shipped because they arrive mostly broken up. I had a hard time finding one whole cracker in the bay
NEG 	Flash/light does not work
NEG 	.Good quality we're definitely buy from the seller I received it very quickly I would definitely order again from this company
NEG 	Like the look and initial quality of this product.
NEG 	This would have 5 stars but it cut my internet speed in half, 200 Mbps down to 91 Mbps. Other than that an awesome product.
NEG 	If you just need to consume some calories and protein, this works. It definitely doesn't taste amazing or even remotely natural, and it's a bit on the thick side, but for convenience it's completely fine and the after taste dissipates pretty quickly. Tastes a bit like cheap chocolate with sweetener but as I said, the taste fades fast.
NEG 	Husband loves them they are very nice and sturdy
NEG 	Very comfortable and sturdy. Great amount of compression!
NEG 	can't answer the durability question just go the product.
NEG 	Nice beginner guitar for the price.
NEG 	It took a long time to wait. I planted them and really want beauty to grow.
NEG 	Ours broke and we needed a replacement. I found this one and it worked perfectly. Its now 5 months later and the down and back keys aren't working as well. (Probably cause its one of the most used keys.) I'm very satisfied with the price to value so I will be buying another.
NEG 	I really liked this film! I think the casting was key... the Actor who played Jovan had me engaged from the start with his moral dilemma. Overall, the acting was well done, the production quality was consistent and well executed and the storyline was fresh but with twists. You can tell the director spent a lot of time making each shot the best it could be. Great job by all involved.
NEG 	I literally put this out there 5 minutes ago immediately after the postman left and it seems to work. My water bath is ridged at the bottom so unfortunately the suctions won’t work but that’s not a fault of the pump. I like it but make sure you have this in direct sunlight and plenty of water in the bird bath.
NEG 	I'm really happy with the case. It's stylish and the color looks great. Complaints are that the pads on the bottom fell off (good thing replacements are included) and the keyboard cover doesn't lay as flat as I'd hoped.
NEG 	My sister bought this, but she said that she didn't read it throughly, since it had bad words or inappropriate parts. Book is complete.
NEG 	This is a cute swimsuit, but the top offers deceptively little coverage and tends to slip down when I'm moving around. Luckily, you can tighten the straps, so that does help a bit with that problem. Still, I would not recommend this swimsuit for anything who wears larger than a C cup.
NEG 	I did not dislike anything about the product it was a great fit and my son loves them
NEG 	Great sound. Video is good.
NEG 	Absolutely love this set!! Super pretty without being overdone, only wish the bra straps were adjustable! I’m 5’5” and 130 lbs for reference
NEG 	These were very adorable and though the one for the older kids was kind of small in length, it still made her dress pop!!
NEG 	I ordered these boots in brown and received them in black - my third order that was incorrect from this seller! That said, I probably would have kept them, but they were far too large even though I ordered a half-size down as indicated in other reviews. I would caution other buyers to consider ordering a full-size down. That said, the boots seemed sturdy and were comfortable when I tried them on, and the style is just as nice as in the photos. Might try ordering again in a smaller size and pray the fourth time is the charm!
NEG 	Came packaged nicely, however it was covered in lint..???? Super comfortable but the lint was rather annoying to remove.
NEG 	Both for myself as a gift. Can’t beat the price
NEG 	Lighter duty than previous printer MX 922 which we had for years. Paper tray capacity is smaller. Annoying that it forces you to use the rear paper feed for large format photo paper. It automatically changes the setting if you try to say you are printing 8 1/2 x 11 on photo paper. Main reason I chose the model is for the independent color ink cartridges. So many printers have a single cartridge for all colors resulting in a lot of waste when only one runs out.
NEG 	Sneezy sure sang a lot. If you like Hank and his music you should like this.
NEG 	Cute and served a purpose for a holiday party but not high quality for heavy use or multiple uses. I wear size 9 women’s, shoe covers fit well but pointed toe doesn’t stand up like in picture and I kept tripping over it.
NEG 	Absolutely wonderful need to get 3 more
NEG 	The charging and mounting worked great, but the release for the phone grip is a button behind the phone. Usually, without a case, your phone can depress this button and close the grip. However, some cases will have a gap near the button such that the button doesn’t depress.
NEG 	Frame isn't wood but looks close. Sturdy board for the price.
NEG 	I bought this thinking it was an iron on product for tshirts, but it is for decals. You also need to purchase transfer paper with it. For sticker decals, this is ok, its easier than rolls in certain ways.
NEG 	Really cute! Ordered it for a toddler, fit perfect. Does come folded so takes a while to flatten.
NEG 	Air needle is located in a compartment on the pump handle. Otherwise a good product.
NEG 	One of my favorite movies . Drama and passion. Kinda predictable but still great for all ages.
NEG 	This movie is a good classic
NEG 	The pockets inside the bag are not thought out well. It makes it hard for this bag to be used for general daily purposes. It is only best for thin books and laptops. Otherwise good quality.
NEG 	This was for gift-giving.
NEG 	Wow! I love this cookbook! This cookbook are simple to follow and very healthy as well. The recipes are extremely tempting and at first look sufficiently basic, with this extensive variety of recipes I can make diverse dishes for my family consistently.
NEG 	I received the wrong color the first time and had to reorder. But that happens.
NEG 	Bought for our camper because these won't break. We like the thumb notch in the handle and the size. Coffee doesn't stain them.
NEG 	I bought the teal color in both twin size and king size. The color is true to the picture - very bright. The twin size came rolled up in it's own container. The king size came vacuum packed and have may have been a return previously. I hope not b/c these are gifts. I did unzip the container and the blanket feels very soft. There is no smell. The price was great. So it is white on the sherpa side and teal on the top side. Now to the sage/green one. Very pale color but otherwise same as above. Again, a gift.
NEG 	I was looking for something to keep me warm and soft, lately I have anxiety thinking of going to ross/marshalls/tjmaxx to go through all the racks and try to find a hoodie or etc. and try them all in dressing rooms only to find out it is too big or small! Anyways thats why I ordered this from amazon, the thing is I really liked it but I wish it was a bit thick and keeps you more warm but overall I liked it. I am gonna wear in the house and maybe while sleeping now in LA it is getting cold at nights. But if you are looking for something to wear outdoors and keep you warm this is not the product for you,and pockets have a weird fabric inside like polyester which I do not like. And hand wash only which is a problem for me we will see how it goes 😀
NEG 	First one had a small leak on the faucet. Returned it, easy process. New one works great. Using it for church every week, so still holding up.
NEG 	Good shoes for the price
NEG 	This hatchet has very good head to total weight balance. I was disappointed with the narrow grip area on the handle. I plan on adding leather to the handle. Very sharp and stays that way.
NEG 	It does the job, but not as sturdy as we had hoped. We thought that we were getting a higher grade of metal, but it is what we ordered.
NEG 	I am disabled from terminal cancer, and pretty much doomed to live out the remainder of my days under home hospice and laid up on my comfortable couch. My large den is mostly lit by the neon signs I've purchased to adorn my man cave, with other lamps near the walls that sit on end tables and such. But I needed one light to hang over the arm of my couch with remote operation to give my immediate area some brightness at a touch, whether it be for reading or whatever. The lamp came in a deceptively small, but stout box. It assembled in moments, and was no problem to twist its light so that it hung directly over my shoulder and gave me the light I was needing. Its plenty bright to read by, or construct models, or whatever I can imagine I'd need. And the ability to adjust the light from a warm glow to a cool white is a nice touch. If I had any complaint, it would be the remote. Where still smaller than most other remotes I own, I don't think it warrants the need for five presets and AA batteries (not included). It's just a minor gripe that I thought I'd add on an otherwise perfect fit for what I was needing. A smaller remote that used AAA batteries and a smaller inventory of face buttons just seems much more feasible for such a simple device. For example, there is a button for "breastfeeding" that is indicated by the picture of a milk bottle. Ummm... okay then. But at any rate, great product! Keep in mind, I've only had it for only three days or so, so I cannot speak on item longevity.
NEG 	The speaker is nice looking, small and light. It looks exactly as the photo shows. The sound is ok. Definitely not Bose quality or even close to it. But for $18 the sound quality matches the price. I’m using this speaker for my bedroom, so it’s fine. I wouldn’t use this as a speaker for a large area like a living room.
NEG 	Well in the picture it says it has 2 vibrators when it really has only one. Other than that it's light and very versatile, I use it for my herniated disc and my epicondylitis and it's great that it's wireless cos I can take it with me to trips and restaurants and stuff. I just think the publicity has to be more accurate. It wouldn't hurt if it really had 2 vibrating points, and better yet, that not only the middle part vibrated but all 3 sections we're functional. Just an idea for Homedics.
NEG 	Another good Samantha Wolf mystery. I'm not usually big on supernatural type stories but it isn't over done and seems to fit perfectly with this series. I've enjoyed them all, and like another reviewer said, the stories just seem to get better and better. Each book can be stand-alone if you desire, as the author explains who the characters are in each story and each story has a satisfying conclusion, but it's much more fun to read them all and that's what I recommend. By the way, I'm a 68 year old male, so don't just consider them only for girls or younger readers. Now I've got to buy the next one so I don't miss anything!
NEG 	It's a very nice foundation. Not 5 star nice but good
NEG 	So far, so god. Just started playing this game.
NEG 	It's fun but she gets annoying! I am just glad she didn't "come to life" in the middle of the night forcing me to have to shoot it!!
NEG 	Great tap show for the price. My only complaint is the sound quality isn’t that great but to be expected at this price point.
NEG 	I really like this product, it very good! I will order more! 👌
NEG 	Fits and looks nice . Many color choices . No advertising on hat , comfortable sizing strap .
NEG 	THE BATTERY ONLY LAST ABOUT 4 HOURS BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S GOOD QUALITY.
NEG 	Love them!!! However, after I sanded and washed them, they were a bit rough and I feel like they might splinter.
NEG 	Not as loose fitting as I was suspecting.
NEG 	Performing well so far.
NEG 	This is made out of quality material. The Velcro is strong and the brace forces your shoulders back without pinching or discomfort. It is a smaller brace though and not one size fits all. It fits a child or someone with a small build the best. My 12 year old brother is using it and it fits well.
NEG 	I have 2 switches and we all know how sensitive they are. These glass protectors work great and are a must have for the switch especially with Mario maker 2 coming out...a game that will beg you to use a stylus to play
NEG 	It does it’s job. You get what you pay for. It works.
NEG 	They do the job so far
NEG 	great product, fast shipping. would highly recommend.
NEG 	Did not know the gauze pad is made of individual sheets .They tend to move around.
NEG 	The timer does what it's supposed to do. It's too soon to know if it saves me any money. There was a small bit of confusion in the wiring diagrams supplied : the main manual indicates that Terminals 1 and 3 need to be connected by a jumper wire and also Terminals 2 and 5. However, in the small enclosed package that has the jumper wires is a sheet that shows Terminals 1 and 5 to be connected and also Terminals 2 and 3. The problem is the supplied jumper wires are too short and those latter connections are impossible to make. It's a little confusing that there are two different jumper connection shown in the paperwork with the product. I went with the one that the wires were long enough to actually work with. In practice I suspect it doesn't matter. Beyond that confusion, the rest of the install was straight forward. Programming is pretty easy, the display however is rather small and you have to look at it closely. Doubling the size of the LCD would be nice ! The buttons were not as smooth as they could be. Sometimes a light press resulted in nothing happening and it was necessary to press rather firmly to get the display to change as expected. But once the setup is done, these don't have to be touched again unless the program needs to be altered. It is very easy to bring the water heater on out of cycle by just pushing the large button that is accessible without opening the timer door. It then stays on until the next programmed off cycle or until a user pushes the button again. I'll have to gather a few months of data to see how much I save by using this timer
NEG 	The sound is pretty good. If they would get a little louder, I could give them a 5 star. What I Love about these: When you pull it out of the charging case, it automatically connects to my phone. When I stick it back into the charger, it disconnects. The fit. I didn't know if the upside down, fill your ear design would be comfortable, but it actually is. It makes these very stable and I can even run with them in without them moving at all. LIke, I said before, if these got a little louder, I could give them a 5 star. I didn't notice that these were noise cancelling. So can't comment on that. I only ever keep on in, so that's probably why I didn't notice.
NEG 	I suppose product color is irrelevant due to what the intended use of this product is, but I'm still a little salty. 4 stars.
NEG 	Love my new jeans... definatly found my new place ! They fit great!
NEG 	Good book. Never read anything by this author prior to this but it was free in the sci-fi/fantasy section so I checked it out.
NEG 	I love its construction and looks. was expecting a little more clean low end though.
NEG 	I had a difficult time fitting one of the two mirrors in my bike handle. One side fits ok, but I could not get the other one all the way in the other side. Other than that, it's a nice mirror. I love the fact that it's adjustable in many ways, which gave me the flexibility I need. And it looks good on my black bike.
NEG 	Works great and reasonably priced.
NEG 	Bought this to tidy up some cords in my classroom (I'm a teacher). It's a bit narrower than I expected, but with a little work it fit everything I needed. My computer set up is now neat and out of the way! The included tool was super helpful in first getting the cords inserted.
NEG 	Good product. I haven’t used many others to compare but I like it and it was easy to clean.
NEG 	A little small but perfect for a ground blind.
NEG 	This meets my needs for recycling and still lets me pick up and dispose of my dog’s waste.
NEG 	Insightful, witty, perhaps unnecessarily verbose in places, and as with any book, you have to pan for the gold ... but those nuggets are there! This book will improve my writing, even if I do not 100% agree with all of the author's techniques.
NEG 	These cartridges are a great alternative to the OEM at a fraction of the cost. The only downside is you are guessing at what color you are opening unless you find the sticker of what color it is through the yellow bag that they are each individually packaged in. The shipping box is solid and the foam fits great. All 4 are in one box and arrived perfectly.
NEG 	has all that is needed
NEG 	Saw a difference in days Good buy
NEG 	It definitely is something you could make yourself but for the price you might as well buy this with your other special tools for fork work. It was very very handy for my seal replacement and made leveling my oil a breeze. Only thing I found wrong was it seemed on mine the measuring needle part was upside down as compared to videos I saw on it. Easy fix though, I didn't even flip it I just used math and subtracted from 300 instead of counting up from 0
NEG 	These are ok. I have to constantly stop and clean it out when using it. It works ok when you very first use it for about the first 10 seconds then after that, you have to stop every minute or so and clean it out and oil it so it cuts the hair. I purchased a Wahl clipper years ago and I remember that cutting my dog's hair like butter but after a few years it barely worked even after I put in a new blade so I purchased this. It's not great but it's ok.
NEG 	The arms on these are shorter than any other readers I have bought. Seem to be sized more for women than men. They look good, but don't fit that well for a man.
NEG 	Cute design, but the top flap is kind of awkward. When the toybox gets full the box kind of bows out in different directions and the top doesn't really close correctly. It's a little sloppy looking. I like that it's soft though so you don't have to worry about smashed fingers.
NEG 	Dog loves it. The sound is weird; sounds like there's an echo. I love that it comes with 2 covers.
NEG 	I am not an expert on chai. I am rating this tea solely on it's own merits and not in comparison to other types of chai. It smells wonderful with all the warm spices you expect. The bags are individually wrapped. The labels on the bags recommend a steeping time of 5 minutes. This made a smooth mug of tea. There was no bitterness. I added 1 teaspoon of unprocessed sugar. I tried it before adding milk. The taste of the tea was far less strong than the scent of the tea. Without milk, it made for a delicate and pleasant tea. I could have even let it steep another minute. For the tea to have a full-bodied flavor with milk in it, I had to leave the bag in as I drank it or steep 2 bags at once for 6 minutes. Of course, personal tastes determine how a person likes their tea, but this review may give you a general guideline. It tastes especially good with a couple of teaspoons of 'Hoosier Hill Farms' powdered coconut milk in it. It pairs beautifully with the warm spices.
NEG 	These gloves are perfect for pruning holly or pulling weeds, and they save me from the irritations usually caused because of my allergies.
NEG 	Not as what I thought as the high light pens.But my daughter love them.
NEG 	It’s a little small but it does the job
NEG 	This is a great solution to the problem we had of not having a DVD player to watch all the kids movies that my mother in law has foisted upon us. It can plug into the tv, but far better is the ability to let my toddler get her limited screen time anywhere she pleases without forcing me to watch the movies. The seller even offered to send a free car headrest mount so we can take movie on the road. It also has a usb and sd card port so digital files can be played in addition to the discs. The controls are so simple my toddler can operate it, and the swivel screen is a great feature that allows the buttons to be hidden from the prowling 1 year old determined to press buttons and wreak havoc.
NEG 	I got complimented already. Style, color and concept is great. Hate that it tangles easily. It's fashion jewelry. As expected, color changer and can tell it's ok quality
NEG 	They are cute, but the fit is just okay. Keep slipping off the back of my heel.
NEG 	Good for beginners, only downfall is the battery does not last long. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.
NEG 	Liked the small round size very much since I only have a few daily pills. Would like the colors to be different to easily pick the right one for the time of day.
NEG 	Wow better than I expected
NEG 	I like this item, easy to set up and use. The only thing I don't like is trying to get it back in the bag. ugh I bought a golf mat too so I could use it in my hall. Would be nice if a mat was included.
NEG 	Holds a lot of glasses.
NEG 	Great Bulb, work amazing
NEG 	It worked for what I needed it for
NEG 	I have a King 💤 # bed & it fits perfectly plus color is deep & rich as pictured. I have not washed it yet & I did have to air it out for a slight odor.
NEG 	Product received was as ordered. Shipping was delayed beyond original quote, however ordered product is a spare replacement, so no negative impact.
NEG 	Hard to evaluate; I lost a pet and that is what this represents.
NEG 	good sheets for the price
NEG 	These are good they work well
NEG 	the only thing was that the box had a whole in it but the puzzle inside was in a plastic bag with no damage.
NEG 	I love how great amazon is about preparing food and household products for shipping. Everything is always packaged so well and isn’t damaged during delivery. Even drinks!
NEG 	These are good movies. First one is the best. 2nd one is not too shabby. Both are certainly much, MUCH better than Jeepers Creepers 3. If you like horror films, give them a watch!
NEG 	Great modem and router combination. No more need to lease a modem from the cable company, so it paid for it self in less than a year.
NEG 	Great value for the money. It is a little firm, but it turns out that I like it that way. Plus it keeps you cool.
NEG 	The wheel is nice and easy to set up, The cord from the wheel to the console is very short however. Also, if you do not have a proper desk and chair setup to mount this to that allows alot of body movement and a stable mount for the wheel the setup will feel inadequate. I feel like one of the special racing seats also sold on amazon is almost necessary to fully enjoy this product. Also the plastic screws that allow you to mount the wheel to a desk feel flimsy and breakable
NEG 	Super soft and a great fit.
NEG 	My baby loves it. I little in the heavy side.
NEG 	The purse looks great, just too big for me. The wallet zipper broke the 2nd day. My coworker loves the purse.
NEG 	Installation was simple and functionality is exactly as described. Would recommend for LED lights.
NEG 	Very cute! Fits the note 9 well.
NEG 	Loved this dress! Very comfy and fits great! Material is a little thin but not see through. I bought a large, in the navy blue.
NEG 	Not a huge historical romance person, but I really enjoyed this book. It was a good read that flowed nicely. Author paid attention to detail and it wasn't to wordy with language that was used at that time.
NEG 	The Murmur took a bit to get going but in the end I enjoyed the book and was racing through the last few chapters. Lots of characters to follow and they all "talk" at some point, so you need to pay attention.
NEG 	Excellent read, intrigue suspense, whole lot of drama, betrayal, spiteful, confusion, revenge, and a whole lot of healing. I could not put this book down. Love the storyline but a little disappointed in the ending. Definite recommend.
NEG 	The water was great, but a couple of the bottles lid was cracked so the water leaked out. Since they were contaminated I had to dispose of them. However, I would order again.
NEG 	I like it however the scent is a bit strong. Definitely moisturizing!
NEG 	Order arrived on time and as described.
NEG 	I like the look and number of pockets but do wish the pockets were larger or the size of the bag overall was a little larger. I'm unable to fit some larger items (like my hairspray that I can't open to transfer to a travel size bottle) in there that I'm used to being able to fit in other toiletry bags.
NEG 	great craft brushes. a little too absorbent. sucks up most of my mod podge
NEG 	Great design. Comfy fabric
NEG 	Wearing it for the first time and there are some things I like and some things I don't. I ordered my regular bra size. The next size up might be too big, not sure. I like the fact that there is enough closure on the side that skin does not bulge out but if I had a say in the design I would add more coverage in front. It is low and it tends to push your breast toward the center which causes a bulge. I like the back support and I think it will be more comfortable after I get used to it. Will wear for a week before deciding if I will keep it. Update: after wearing it for a few days I have concluded this bra is great for small busted women....however, full figure women might find the front coverage not adequate. I moved all the adjustments as wide as they went and the bra is comfortable enough to most likely keep. Will wear a week before deciding.
NEG 	Needed this for a birthday gift. Arrived 10 days after ordering it, after I needed it to arrive, and customer service was very good with a refund. Pleased with them.
NEG 	Nicely sized to fit within the Instant Pot for easy storage. The magnets were what sold me on this vs. other similar sets. DISAPPOINTING. They do not have enough strength to adhere tightly and they will not conform to the curvature of the Pot. One magnet was damaged, but will not seek a replacement as it won't work on the Pot anyway.
NEG 	Not bad for what was paid
NEG 	I need a half size smaller. Love the variety of rings I received . Very comfortable!!!!
NEG 	These are great little rollers, however they were too small for what I needed them for.
NEG 	Fast delivery to Canada. Thanks
NEG 	Very fast delivery, just wish the designs were painted on and not made of plastic wrapping.
NEG 	I Initially had issues with these units being too quiet like others have said, however I solved this by moving the speakers from behind the cheek pads to in front of the cheek pads. So the speakers are now directly touching my ears when the helmet is on instead of having an additional layer of fabric in between. I also noticed the volume is different depending on audio source. Bike to bike is actually pretty loud I could hear my buddy fine even at 85 mph (he was hearing a bit of wind noise though). Music is a bit quieter followed by answering phone calls paired to a mobile phone being almost too quiet (before moving the speakers). Music quality is obviously not great but at this price point I was not expecting it would match any set of headphones. Battery life seems to be good as well went for 3 relatively long rides (music and intercom) and it didn't die. I am not aware of a way to check the state of charge. If you are looking for a good COMS system for the cheap at 40 bucks a unit these are a solid choice but if you want good music quality then consider other options.
NEG 	Pretty thin volume and some dated projects (a tie rack? maybe for a business dad?), but overall appealing to my kid with clear project instructions.
NEG 	Really great for price but it is lacking a bit of flavor once brewed.
NEG 	I gave 5 stars for battery life, but I truly can't say yet as it's still brand new. I've only been using this for about a week, but so far so good. There have been a few times the mouse doesn't respond, but it's only for a split second and doesn't stay that way. The spinning wheel for scrolling does feel a bit cheap and I'm concerned how well this will hold up through the wear and tear of normal everyday use, but it's doing okay so far. As far as looks go, it's super cute. I was in the market for a slim mouse and when I found this one with many different colors I couldn't pass it up. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase and would purchase it again.
NEG 	Kiera gets a call, play the game or her twin will die. A stupid joke, until Kevin didn’t pick up the phone. Few clues that don’t add up, to Kevin now missing. Inhaling a powder at his apartment, almost proved lethal for her. A tense, fast paced story, that gripped a reader from the first when she gets a call. The only drawback for me, was her attitude. Continuing on with the next book in series.
NEG 	Best price 50 leis.. only reason didn't give 5 star as size of flowers in all leis ar not same.. some are big as shown in pics.. and some are small... still good product..
NEG 	Cute, fun and would make a great gift for all ages!
NEG 	Very informative. Would have liked a little more elaboration on a few key principles but also appreciate the book was not made as an exhaustive study. Would definitely recommend,
NEG 	The lids I received were grey, not black. They do not close, but otherwise, they are great.
NEG 	When hitting the volume up/down button you can feel the give in the case and you can feel yourself hitting the buttons, but not on the power button. It feels hard and I can't tell if I am actually hitting the button or not. Case is really nice though. Very slick.
NEG 	Received this product fast! Next day with regular shipping. It works well and was priced right! I’ll definitely order it again when I need it.
NEG 	Bend kinda a weird way after awhile but the quality is still good and still charging my phone well!!!
NEG 	Does the trick well but annoying because the clips don't fit under all parts of our top rack on our Town and Country. Fixed by removing clips and reattaching but took a decent amount of time. But otherwise we like it
NEG 	There were a couple of fans that had broken thread and did not work properly, but they were what I needed for my event and they worked well.
NEG 	Have used this for a few years before purchasing online. Same product, affordable and lasting size. Very content.
NEG 	The case appears very sturdy and the color is gorgeous. I would prefer the rubber layer of the case fit a little more snug.
NEG 	So soft - and such vivid colors! My grandson loves it - his big sister has a mermaid tail that made him just a little bit jealous, so now he's set with this "macho" one! I even got him a soft orange astronaut helmet to wear with it - it's perfect! (Gramma Scores!)
NEG 	They are perfect besides the jack gets unplugged constantly
NEG 	The reflective material started falling off within a week. But they seem comfy.
NEG 	Ordered the t-shirt because i liked the style. I liked that it looked to run past the hips. I received in the mail and ordered XL and the shirt barely passes my bellybutton. I am tall and figured an XL would run pass my hips, but it didn't.
NEG 	Decent quality, it does what I want/need it to. It will sit in my closet so wasn't looking for or expecting a "show piece", especially at the price. Not great but not horrible either, really about what I expected maybe a little better even for the price. Sure the finish could have been better, but it isn't an $100+ showpiece either. It did include the watch pillows which was nice and wasn't 100% expected also.
NEG 	So, in terms of sizing, I would say if you want it to fit as your regular size- most likely size up. I was worried based on the model sizing pics and went up 2 sizes, from a M to an XL and it fits but is definitely long on me and a little baggy but I guess thats good since I'm 15 weeks pregnant and have room to grow into it but if you want it to fit like your regular size, only go up 1 size if even that.
NEG 	I think is very nice gun , for the money is good ! I have used contractors gun from graco and feel just like it . Plus extra filters. Great deal.r
NEG 	Not bad. Just a lil to big.
NEG 	Not a huge fan of the flavor but it works so I keep buying it! Spicy. My friend LOVES the flavor soooo
NEG 	Works but not as nice to turn and use to tighten.
NEG 	First sword I bought on Amazon and honestly not that disappointed, the only critique that I have is that it came and what looks like very used condition there's stains all over the sword itself and the sheath, it also had a very weird smell to it.
NEG 	Protects iPhone in a compact design but allows phone's appearance to show through.
NEG 	I love the ease of printing my own photos, but the cartridge and paper are expensive compared to getting prints at a local store.
NEG 	Really pretty color, nice quality, fits my phone perfectly, and has pronounced buttons for easy use. I only wish I could fit more than one card in the card holder slot.
NEG 	Some of the tips were damaged, however, they are very nice. Love the variety of colors.
NEG 	Will come in handy on the beach
NEG 	They are nice bags for the price. We used them for my daughter's birthday party as goodie bags and personalized them for each girl. While we were ironing on some of the letters the bag seemed to get to hot and now have little ripples in them not bad enough that they can't be used but that's why I gave them 4 stars since they said they could be used with iron-on transfers also the strings seem cheap but it goes with the price paid. They did turn out cute and I think the girls will love them!
NEG 	It fits tight and make sure you wash it by hand and don’t put it in the dryer
NEG 	These are really cute, however, I rated these 4. When completely screwed on, the flowers are not even on each side. I’d have to loosen the one end in order for them to match up.
NEG 	Works really well, but months later I still have to pick off little pieces of cotton on me from the towel after drying off.
NEG 	Daughter loves it. Is wearing it tomorrow for Halloween and will use it for dress up after that.
NEG 	Ii would have given it a 5 star rating, but the non-stick coating is delaminating from both the upper tray and the inside bottom of the basket. This surprises me a little bit, as I’ve always hand washed and it’s never been in the dishwasher.
NEG 	Exactly what I needed to hang my plates.
NEG 	Nice build, fits perfect. Great product for the price.
NEG 	All good except that the button for the tilt mechanism is way too high up for me to use, so basically, that function is useless.
NEG 	Not as laugh-out-loud funny as some of the other Vacation movies, but clever.
NEG 	For the value it works great. Although, I would recommend hosing it out occasionally.
NEG 	Spiritual concepts made personal through characters. Comforting, gentle thoughts.
NEG 	Would have given five stars if this included the labels.
NEG 	Work great. After a couple tailgates these start losing grain. No major complaints though.
NEG 	Works great but came with a corner broken.
NEG 	These are super cute. They look nicer in person. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are very wide. But other than that they are great.
NEG 	Love these excellent quality and my kids love them, but wish they made a truck or car to pull them with! Also the only complaint is that because they are close when attached, when turning curves the magnets will sometimes catch each other and mess up the creation!
NEG 	Works well for our bathroom counter. We have really tiny counters so this is perfect to keep things organized and out of the way. Easy to clean and very nice to have. I recommend this product.
NEG 	Arrived just as stated
NEG 	Good product. Feels solid which is nice but I have a bit of trouble latching it onto some tire stems without leaking a bit of air, but once it is on its fine.
NEG 	I liked the hero and heroine. Their chemistry felt real and compelling. The mystery’s ending, however, felt abrupt and unresolved.
NEG 	Enjoying my fire hd.
NEG 	Which movie & tv shows news.
NEG 	I love these crackers. But somehow these didn’t taste quite the same as the crackers that come in the small packages.
NEG 	The silver in the band isn't as silver or shinny as in pictures, but still looks good. Looks like it might last through some rough wear, but we'll see.
NEG 	This is a good sized screen but is not lined in the back however this dosent appear to be an issue if theres no light coming from behind the screen. My kids hook the xbox up to it and play video games on it and we had outdoor movie night and it worked great! It is a light frame and will need to be weighed down a little if its breezy outside. I am very happy with this purchase!
NEG 	These help me with toe alignment blisters
NEG 	Works for a bike carrier!
NEG 	Used for exercising with abdominal hernia Seems to be helping
NEG 	Used for medical purposes. Smell was pleasant and mild. No irritation. Pump makes it easy to use.
NEG 	Works good. I have a small dog who does not let toe nail clippers anywhere near her. This allows me to somewhat trim her nails. For a less scared dog, this will work even easier. It has two speeds and is lightweight and easy to hold. Charged fast.
NEG 	Very official looking. Slightly blurry but not enough to be problematic. Seems durable. I like that the fields of text are somewhat customizable to protect my privacy.
NEG 	I love the tools, they are great! Work well and made well. The stencils are just paper so they aren't the easiest to use because you have to be very careful with them in order to not ruin them. The tools are really handy and pretty much any design you decide to do there is a tool for. The tools are well worth the price of the set and the stencils are just a bonus.
NEG 	The blue tooth keyboard case was easy to pair to the iPad. It comes with a charger. The case is nice and slim its not bulky as you might think for a keyboard case. I like that there are multiple angle options for propping up the iPad. The magnetic closure is good and strong. I just wish that it would auto sleep and wake upon open and close.
NEG 	Pretty good but the material somehow bleeds or turns darker over time
NEG 	I like this duvet but it's not for everyone. I chose this one because it claimed to be an all season duvet cover and so far that's held up true for winter, I haven't gotten to test it out in summer yet. I needed something to keep me warm yet be light enough to not cause my fiance to sleep hot, I didn't notice that the covering was 100% polyester and thus he still sleeps hot yet not as much as before. This is the only downside I have found in this duvet so far besides the fact that it doesn't fit properly in the two cal king duvet covers i purchased separately, it's about 4 inches smaller than my covers. But all in all it is a thin duvet that keeps me warm and is soft to the touch so I'm happy with it
NEG 	Our two kitties like this wet food. We also feed them Stella & Chewies chicken & a high quality kibble so they get well balanced meals.
NEG 	The only drawback is the way they plug in. The large USB connection sticks out a couple of inches and therefore tends to get knocked around.
NEG 	Second time I bought this product. Gave one to my sister who also got a Samsung Galaxy Note 9.
NEG 	Ok but have an aftertaste when using with water
NEG 	This product was semi easy to put together and fits well in the location it was purchased for.
NEG 	Good size, easy to use. But they came very dull, and sharpening them from dull was not simple. But I'm happy with them
NEG 	It was a gift, don't think they have opened it. sorry
NEG 	They are a gift, so I don't know if they will wash well.
NEG 	I really like this product. It feels good to get a little head massage but I find it best to use when you're ready to go to bed or can at least relax. My eyes shake/vibrate when it's on and it's actually pretty uncomfortable for me. But I do love this product! I just have to close my eyes.
NEG 	The first one was broke due to poor packaging. The replacement came in beter packaging. Looks really cool and had several comments about it from Friends. I give it 4 stars do to the poor packaging and having to send back.
NEG 	Amazingly cute!! They are a Xmas gift so I still don’t know if theyre comfy but they look amazing
NEG 	I have had the elastic version of this belt for some time now in a navy color and really like it except for the fact that being elastic when I unbuckle it, it will pop out of my belt loops so decided to try the clear plastic one. I find the elastic type to be more comfortable than the clear plastic but works well also and does not pop out of my belt loops.
NEG 	Light came intact and safe but one of the two lights wasnt working. Oak leaf has great customer service and sent two new ones to me within the week. The lights are very pretty and add a great accent, they do feel a bit fragile though.
NEG 	Nice pillow covers. Great to put on over your existing pillow to update for the fall. Lightweight and should be easy to clean.
NEG 	My son loved his lego themed balloons. And so did all the kids at his party. The only reason for 4 stars is because some of the balloons lost their faces when it was blown up. Not many though. I’d still buy them again.
NEG 	I loved on how the writer explains everything in sequence, even if it some parts were way too technical and are not for everyone to comprehend. Found a lot of interesting/previously-unknown facts and felt that I actually got something out of the book.
NEG 	Awesome lock good outside in desert weather. The numbers dont unlock in the center and if its dark kind of a pain. But will buy another
NEG 	Work great just impossible to get completely clean
NEG 	Likes: great design, well built. Dislike: I have a tendency to want to lean slightly on the table but am afraid to with the 20 pound capacity.
NEG 	Good read that held my interest! It kept me guessing who the murderer was. Loved the different personalities of the main characters. Hope you're still writing.
NEG 	I like how it looks.
NEG 	Great product easy to install very sturdy
NEG 	My dog seems to like it
NEG 	doesn't have the range promised. Works pretty well, though.
NEG 	Bought for acne for my son. Does a good job. Does not foam up, but it does seem to be working just fine.
NEG 	Fun game for the family. I was a little disappointed that the box came with a hole in it. It was a gift for my my brother and didn't have time to return it. Bit of a bummer.
NEG 	This came out to be exactly what I wanted. It wasnt see thru and it provided the privacy I needed. The only thing was my dog liked to take the leaves off 🙄.
NEG 	Enjoyed this story very much. The mystery and romance were well intertwined. It almost Made me want to believe in ghosts.
NEG 	I really like this iced coffee. Great product. Also wonderfully packaged and shipped. I had an issue previously with way product was packaged and condition in which product arrived. Amazon replaced and perfectly presented.
NEG 	For the price I paid this unit is a good mix of versatile and portable. Good for visiting with friends or other small social occasions.
NEG 	Good product but too expensive
NEG 	Entertaining and not typical
NEG 	Easy to play. Good time waster.
NEG 	Was a great gift and since I am listening to it as well. I can say it is worth purchasing, especially if you are going on a long trip.
NEG 	I love this strap. I use it as a safety strap when I carry my DSLR with a large lens. I am able to secure it close enough that when I walk long distances, the strap carries some of the weight instead of it all being on my hand. Only problem with it, for me....the carabiner is metal and connects to the camera plate which is also metal. So, when I walk they clink against one another. Bad news for a wildlife/bird photographer. So, I am currently searching for a solution to that. Maybe a plastic connection or a small strap. We'll see. Update: I used a bolt cutter to cut off the steel snap with swivel from the webbing and replaced it with an aluminum carabiner. Problem solved.
NEG 	I like these rubber protectors because they provide grip and the clear protector was cool because my laptop has lights and they shine through it, but the only con of this was it stretched out and it doesn't fit my laptop properly anymore
NEG 	This is cute but not as I expected. About the size of your night stand. Can hold 50 files the way it's designed.
NEG 	They are leak proof, durable, and good for traveling, however some of the lips on the cups were messed up and the lids were also sometimes wonky. I ended up having to throw out some non-usable ones.
NEG 	Loved it! However, some of these come with a little design that has a pointy end (ex. The star) and at times it’s uncomfortable for the kids. But bc you get so many you have plenty of options of the safer ones.
NEG 	Very soft, and actually has deep pockets. Fabric is thin so will hold off on durability
NEG 	This works great, on my home made pie crusts. Friends think I have skills, but I don't. Very happy.
NEG 	This product is such a great idea, being able to write on the magnetic strip. I used it to assign tablets at work to employees for each shift
NEG 	I don’t think this thing came with instructions, but it was easy to set up regardless. Took about 15 minutes to set up. We had 3 adults in this tent and still had plenty room left to spare. You can fully stand up in this tent.
NEG 	Advice.. Measure twice & order once. Looks to be very good quality, unfortunately I ordered too large so waiting for the new one. Confident it will be of equal quality.
NEG 	This is a beautiful and well made wallet EXCEPT that the snap closure does not allow ant “give” when the wallet is filled. Snapping it closed is difficult. If that problem is corrected it would be perfect!
NEG 	Very pleased with my purchase. The only not con: the specially designed trays: for bowls, plates...they don’t work. This product would be 5 stars if they just supplied 4 flat trays as opposed to the differently designed trays. They don’t fit any plates or bowl I have. And I’ve tried all of them. For reference I have fiesta ware dishes and also replay brand kid dishes. None of the bowls or plates fit in the weird trays provided. But I’m still able to use it and it still works good enough. Pleased with the available drying space and pleased it doesn’t take up too much counter space. Easy to assemble. Very functional for use with window plants as well.
NEG 	So far my son really likes this Headset!
NEG 	Great addition to the Halloween costume
NEG 	Nice collection of one of our favorite sci-fi series with plenty of extras about the makings of the show and the evolution of the storyline. However, some scenes in the middle of some episodes lose their focus or definition for some unknown reason.
NEG 	Very pleased with this purchase ..
NEG 	Don’t be a fool and but HDMI cables from your local store. These are just as good if not better and at better price. Used these on an installation and they worked as they should.
NEG 	The ONLY reason I didn’t give this 5 stars is bcuz of the sting. It was kind of pointless since it didn’t really tighten the fit and then fell out first wash. But the fit itself is spot on! They’re extremely soft && cute. Prob my favorite comfy pants now !
NEG 	Bought the set for both specifically for relocation. They are cheap and get the job done, especially a set of 5 can move substantial amount of clothes (3 suits OR 6 dress shirts on hangers in each bag). It was perfect as the moving company provides clothes hanging boxes and I do not want to have the clothes contact them. The problem was that the zipper was fairly weak. I only used the zipper once on all of them, and the zipper on one bag already failed. The material is on the flimsy side as well. For the price it was a great one time temporary use, for something that you will reuse a lot, it'll be better to invest in something with better quality.
NEG 	Great product, wished price was lower
NEG 	One thing that drives a person nuts is trying to find a missing puzzle piece. Yep, one border piece missing and the company is unable to replace this piece. However, pieces fit snug and clean, which enables one to pickup three or four pieces that have been put together and move to the main puzzle. My wife, who has dementia was able to work with the larger pieces. Overall, this is a great puzzle.
NEG 	Anything made by Gorilla is great...this is no different. I used it to secure loose exterior faucet to brick....works like a champ.
NEG 	Very nice and great quality.
NEG 	A good value. It's great to have the latches; it's great to see through the tote to see what's inside.
NEG 	Great toilet paper but the rolls are really large. Didn't fit well unless I took some sheets off first.
NEG 	Came apart real easy. To small for growing African grey
NEG 	Easy to use, still learning.That I can get help of O should need it.
NEG 	Works as intended. I would add a couple of nice touches as a light up remote control and longer wall electric plug. Not a lot of instructions, but really is so simple to install anyone can figure it out. will order extra to gift.
NEG 	I have huge boobs so it hard to find anything that will fit right and I jean completely right. I how ever love the way it fits
NEG 	I ordered for a friend who wanted them. She thought they'd be larger in size but theyre sturdy looking. It's costume jewelry
NEG 	My only complaints about this tent is it had a weird smell to it for the first couple of days sure that's typical with any tent & the zipper is loud & sometimes catchy. All the poles & corner pieces are metal not plastic. I put electrical tape at each connection helped with the rattling & the squeaking.
NEG 	Great story that follows Marisol and Chase from Possess through Valentine's Day. It is a super sweet story that you don't have to have read Possess to enjoy. But is also a very nice addition to learn more about what happens to them if you have read the main story already.
NEG 	I liked the ideal of how it works and after first use, hearing strange sounds. In my opinion the hose connections seemed to be a little delicate.
NEG 	Product was as described. Looks good and blends well.
NEG 	This is lovely and exactly what I wasn’t looking for - but a large (my normal size) was a bit loose around the chest. The item description says this will only work for A-C, but I’m a DD and think it’s fine. It was right enough around “the girls” but was loose around the band. I’m 5’3’’ and 160lbs. I don’t know my normal band and cup size because I exclusively wear bralettes.
NEG 	I really liked it easy to use.
NEG 	Good grip on these cups because of the perforated outer shell design.
NEG 	This set worked perfectly for my daughters trolls themed 2nd birthday party.
NEG 	Loooks nice. Soft fabric. Material is just as expected. Well worth the money.
NEG 	I love the way the journal feels, and the pages are thin, but still sturdy enough to hold up to markers, glue, and whatever else you want to stick inside your journal. There's also a nice pocket at the back for holding inserts. I've gotten a different color of this journal before and have been overall happy with it. The journal has a Key Page, three index pages, two pen test pages, and a mindfulness page. the key and index pages are before the journal and not included in the numbered pages (which is perfect, I find the index very useful). The pen test, and mindfulness pages, however, ARE included in the page numbers. they're located at the end, and not terribly obstructive. But slightly annoying. According to the product description there should be 201 pages PLUS the pen test and mindfulness page. I've gotten their journals before, I have this exact one in a different color and it has 201 pages plus the extras so I'm not sure why the burgundy one doesn't. Not a huge deal, but frustrating considering I'm using this specific journal for a project and I want to use all 200 pages.
NEG 	I purchased these to use in a home office. They are made very durable and look nice. They hold markers and erasers nicely. They are designed to be mounted by screws, which are not included. Overall, I am happy with my purchase...
NEG 	In spite of some reviews, I think this is a decent, lightweight travel case for jewelry. I like the color, zipper and compartments. I was looking for something specifically designed to hold multiple necklaces with thin chains that tangle easily, and something that could handle multiple pairs of dangly earrings. I don't have a ton of rings and heavy bracelets, so I didn't need that kind of storage. This one will work. I just wish could find one that is more artistic (perhaps featuring the art of famous artists, or rock 'n' roll, edgy themes, etc.) and made out of organic cotton/linen or hand-tooled leather (boho) for a decent price. These plastic quilted cases are not exactly my style, and the cloth jewelry rolls don't seem to have the structure or storage I need. Thoughts? Anyone?
NEG 	They sound very good. I’m quite pleased with the audio quality. The metal machining is also very expensive looking but the edges are a bit sharp. The cord is sturdy and looks like it would last a long time, but I am disappointed in how easily tangled it is. The cord is a bit sticky, so it’s harder to just shake out the tangled parts like I would expect from a non tangle cord.
NEG 	Have to have the app open for it to receive data. That’s stupid
NEG 	Worked well and met my beeds for a replacement bell
NEG 	These cabinets come in a compact box with foam padding to prevent shipping damage. That's a nice feature. They come in a compact box because the cabinets are actually made up of three rectangular shaped units. That helps to make them fairly strong once they are put together with the back panels. I have been putting together press board furniture for 30+ years and have seen the parts quality and chip board quality decrease. This is about as low in quality as I have seen yet, but it still works to suit a purpose. There is a faint chemical smell from these. The best way I have to put these together is to put the top box together first on a carpeted floor, square up the box and attach the back panel, then attach the second box, square it up again and attache the back panel, etc. I used some glue I had around for strength. The dowel pins are small. I have never seen them that thin before, but again they do the job. I bought two and have only put together the first one so far. The only thing I will do differently with the second one is to use small finish nails instead of the easily bendable things they provide. They should have provided plastic covers for the cams, but once the cabinets are loaded they are not visible. There are small holes in the top panel to secure the cabinet to the wall. I would have preferred that they not leave holes in there. Once fully put together the cabinets look decent and are fairly sturdy. They are just the right size to have six rows of DVDs or Blu Rays. The main reason I got these is because they fit in very small spaces and I needed extra storage. If I was looking for something more permanent, I definitely would look at other products. As it is these should be viewed as cheap and disposable but good for the purpose they are made for. I had thought about using two cabinets and building them so they are five boxes high instead of three. May still try that, and if I do it would be necessary to anchor them to a wall. The back panels are not really configured to do that because their interlocking "jigsaw" pattern is specific to three boxes, but it may be worth a try to save floor space. A wall of these things could look pretty cool and would be functional.
NEG 	The only problem is that the sides of the bag have to be taped down to the plastic inner section before sliding it into the steel container
NEG 	These are nice for the pool area, but they stuffed them all in one cup so the opening makes them look kind of cheap
NEG 	This case is tasteful without being too plain. It doesn't stay closed--I would have liked a strap and snap closure, but otherwise it is fine.
NEG 	Bought it for my spouse, but it would not fit comfortably around his head. He said it was uncomfortable and can't use it. Now I'm using it, and I have to stretch the band out before I do since it gets uncomfortably tight. I would only buy this again if these headbands were in a larger size. I'm petite and it was still tight around my head. Sound quality, buttons, everything else was decent.
NEG 	Nice but produces lots of oil
NEG 	Great bag, but the color is more like a raspberry red, than a wine red. Great purchase for the price though.
NEG 	My mom received cart yesterday. Very happy but could not find the cloth that comes with it. Will someone please send the cloth?
NEG 	Update- The seller contacted me after I had received my refund and sent a new one. Its arrived and isn't too bad, the fur isnt as thick as I would like it to be jut that's okay. One big thing I noticed however is the Packaging was INCREDIBLY different from the first I was sent. This second one came in a fancy zippered bag, while the other was a regular taped close bag. Which was very odd as I'd expect more continuity in companies. When I got this item off my porch the box was SOAKED, not just a little wet, but so wet it was crumbling under my fingers. I still kept some hope, because maybe the fur was in a sealed bag?? It was not, the bag was open ended and filled with water. Normally during rainy and snowy days the packages I receive are wrapped up tight in a bag or other wrap so prevent damage. So I had been feeling comfortable in ordering despite the oncoming snow and not being home. I'll have to change that policy now.
NEG 	Very good value!!!! Nice pictures but have not even used and binding is coming apart or this would be a five star review
NEG 	i thought the tone would be lower....i searched for a "C" note wind chime like my sister has and this one came up....it is a pleasant sound and i like it but not what in was searching for....
NEG 	Surprisingly good for a low-budget knife!
NEG 	Very nice jeans. a little big in the waist but wearable.
NEG 	i mainly needed a sim tool however i find myself using the plyers on this fairly often i just wish it was a little more low profile so it would fit more comfortably in pockets other then that it works great.
NEG 	Works but the guide bar is not too helpful
NEG 	Got several compliments on this.
NEG 	works well. used it with my cell phone and functions as it should. wanted to use it with my tablet but was unable to configure it. maybe with a bit more work I could get it to work.overall a good scope for the money
NEG 	They aren't strong enough to keep their shape but definitely keep the seat backs cleaner.
NEG 	i like the gap on the top of the armband that allows to connect the headphones. i have an iphone x and if fits just perfect. make sure you check the zise chart so you can be happy with the product
NEG 	This book help to discover for how to find the right house, flip it for the greatest profit and market it for the quickest sale. Regarding this book privy to some of best kept secrets of today investors, by avoiding the common mistakes minimize risks and maximize returns in the fastest time possible.
NEG 	A super hot and fast read. I loved the dynamic between the two and the introduction to the M.C. Seriously looking forward to what happens next. I love me a good hot steamy romance.
NEG 	Mina is a very interesting excitable character. I like the descriptions of the animals and the pet rescue business. I recommend this book if you enjoy animals and the mysteries that happen around them.
NEG 	Today I assembled this unit, there certainly are a lot of parts. Although this isn't a particularly difficult piece to assemble, being sober while putting this one together is a good idea. After it was finished I was quite happy with how tight the fabric shelves are and how solid the finished product is.
NEG 	great for the price.
NEG 	You can charge your phone like twice . Almost three
NEG 	My wife loves it, So I love it too 😋...
NEG 	I love this light. I work at night and have worn it around my neck to work every night since I received it. It's super bright and allows me both hands to work with and not have to hold a flashlight.
NEG 	Fits perfect with my Mustang. Definitely helped keep the inside a little cooler.
NEG 	Bought this for my grand daughter. But since it was refurbished, it did not come with any instructions. We are not that "tech savvy" so we are still trying to figure out how to do all the different features. Went online and can't find a manual there either. Other than that, it works great and the rubber cover is a great added feature for "kid proofing".
NEG 	Thought it would be bigger for 4 pounds
NEG 	Does not look like the pic online ok for the money
NEG 	Powerful, but too difficult for beginner
NEG 	This is a good product for the price tag. However not a great quality material. However why to complain, it's great for the price tag
NEG 	I bought this to wear under an open topcoat. The material is thicker than other maxi dresses which is great in that it’s less see though. However, the stretchy material hangs in a way that will accentuate any flaw you may not want showing. I wanted a loose fit and it is. The only thing I don’t like is the bottom! It tappers in and makes it hard to walk a full stride. Feels restrictive. Looks pretty while standing still. And I’m only 5’2 and a Small is pretty long. I’ll need to take about 5” off so maybe that will help me get a better stride! Ha! Lovely dress though.
NEG 	These were easy to install and seem to be of decent quality. The finish looks good with all my different door styles and colors. I really wanted all my doors to be keyed alike, and this set provided that option. In fact, each set came with four keys, so I have plenty of spares.
NEG 	Does the job, but inputs on controller seem to lag slightly. Could be an issue with all adapters in general.
NEG 	Great product. My daughter loves Lara Croft and tomb raider. Solid materials and looks pretty good for a necklace of this price. Well done!
NEG 	Bright sign, looks good by the bar
NEG 	Very soft and a great price
NEG 	The shipping of my order was delayed a few days.
NEG 	We went camping right next to the lake so the bugs are bad and these seemed to help a lot. The way this band goes on isn't the best for kids. It seems to get stretched easy and then falls off.
NEG 	Works ok, didn’t hold up as long as I figured. Used to hold a Cobb accessport. Help up for about a week in cold weather. May work better in the summer time
NEG 	Good quality sound and very comfortable fit. Unfortunately, it does not connect to my Nexus 6P phone.
NEG 	Very easy set up, and works very well. Only reason I'm not 5 stars is the drive seems slower than I expected. Quality and appearance is really good, but a bit faster would be nice. I use this drive every day, and I'm typically using an SSD, so my view of speed may be a bit warped. I've been using SSD for a long time so my expectations for speed on a portable drive may be somewhat unrealistic. I definitely recommend this drive.
NEG 	Really amazing headphones for the price. Amazing wood finish. The bass is very punchy and the highs are decent. Connectivity is great, and I could go a good day and a half with these headphones when I'm on campus. The fins of the earbuds tend to hurt a bit if worn for a longer time, even with the perfect size fit; it could, however, only be my ears, and they do provide other types of fins. My only biggest complaint with these earbuds are that it often falls off when they rest on your neck and off your ears, because the control hub (where the volume control and pause/play controls are) are not in the midpoint, but instead more towards your right ear, and is quite heavy.
NEG 	I haven't been playing that long but long enough to know I'm going to be playing this a long time.
NEG 	These are just like old keys and fit our purpose perfectly
NEG 	I like everything about this cane EXCEPT it needs another notch so the handle can go just a bit lower. I'm 5' 5" and being able to lower it one more notch would have been perfect and a 5 star!!
NEG 	7 year old niece loved it
NEG 	Snug fitting since there is no zipper. Makes getting on and off trickier
NEG 	Good coverage of UK Rugby Easy to install and use.
NEG 	No complaints of as of yet. Received the case in good condition. Fits iPad Pro 9.7 well. Not too heavy. Aesthetically pleasing while offering protection without adding much weight. My only gripe would be that I can’t fold the cover completely behind the iPad if needed. Recommended otherwise!
NEG 	Love it! Just with it was big enough to hold 2 sticks of butter! I’ve had butter bells in the past. They broke over time and were never replaced. Happy to have them again and these are really nice. They look kind of old and fit will in my old country kitchen!
NEG 	Got to light up flag on pole. Clamped one to pole facing upward using hose clamps. Orher a few feet away to side of deck. Adequately illuminates flag on 25’ pole. Nice product.
NEG 	I was really nervous to buy this wig as it was my first time ordering hair online, but I am completely satisfied. Fast delivery, and the hair is very soft with minimal shedding. The hair line was preplucked and didn’t need any additional plucking or bleaching of the knots. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.
NEG 	I am always freezing since losing weight after gastric sleeve, and ask my other sweaters have gotten too big, so i needed a new one. This sweater definitely achieves warmth, haha! My only issue is that the hand holds don't have much stretch. These sweater fits add expected, but it does make it difficult to pull up my sleeves in the case of getting to warm. Overall, though, I love the softness & fit of the sweater & would recommend.
NEG 	Fantastic psychological thriller. Grabs you from the very beginning and never lets go. Will definitely read other Shalini Boland books.
NEG 	I am so glad I bought this book! It’s only been a couple of days but I’ve made several of the recipes. a lot of information on the Keto lifestyle including tips on being successful if you need to make substitutions. She suggests products and tools she uses too. I’m so glad I purchased this book. I cannot wait to try more recipes!!
NEG 	Not sure on these, they are a bit too heavy for my liking and the backs are very long. My daughter loved her pair but I don’t know that I will wear mine.
NEG 	Product seemed to work well, but my dog prefers to lay on the tile instead of the cooling mat. I had to return but the seller was very accommodating.
NEG 	Feels good on the skin and smells great!
NEG 	Would give 5 stars, works really well but doesn't have as many different guides as other Clippers...(for different length cuts).
NEG 	I purchased a small and seemed closer to the size of a medium. Otherwise very nice shirt with soft material.
NEG 	well i bought this set for the cloth button and waist extender. they all seem to be made well but, the non-button extender ones are too slim and aren't large enough to allow pants part to hook up to it, least not the pants i tried to use them with.. the button version is fine.
NEG 	Good enough for HS Grad
NEG 	I was looking for some more usb type c cables to have some at work and at my computer at home. These work really well. My only complaint is that the cables are a little stiff and hard to cable manage, but I'm sure they'll get a little more flexible with time.
NEG 	I'm very happy with these rods. The offer the option of also screwing end mount into the window case.
NEG 	These really are great. The only down fall I have is it’s so hard to get the lids to snap on. Otherwise, 100% recommend. Love them.
NEG 	Was a bit hard to put together due to the vague directions!
NEG 	Fairly large for a countertop. Makes ice quickly. Good for daily use.
NEG 	There are clearly many things to like about this air purifier, but "smart" wifi operation is not one of them. The unit fails to setup wifi on my mesh network which supports both 2.4ghz & 5ghz. Customer service has confirmed that the AirMega will not work on my wifi network or any network that uses the same SID for 2.4 & 5ghz. This leaves out my new Eero mesh network, and would have also failed on my prior non-mesh network because it too used the same SID for 2.4 & 5ghz. After reading some of the other complaints by reviewers, it appears that AirMega may be knowingly selling a wifi connected air purifier that does not work on modern common place wifi networks. The published suggested solution of slowing down your entire wifi network by disabling 5ghz is not a viable solution or a workaround in my book. Also, one smaller point is that the air purifier has 4 speed settings. The top two settings are very loud. Other air purifiers I own (BlueAir for example) are reasonably quiet on all except the maximum fan speed setting.
NEG 	I like the design but it’s a little heavy and peeled my wall paper.
NEG 	Amazing book. I love it. Thanks author. Highly recommended.
NEG 	Love!!! So soft and so so cute!! It fits jus as expected!! Very soft material. Love
NEG 	So I’ve been wearing this ring for 6 months now. It looks amazing when it’s clean but I feel like you have to clean it often for it to look good. For durability I still have all my stones however the metal the ring is made of is soft. I bent mine so there’s a flat spot on it. I would buy the ring again, I love it and it’s holding up great, I just have to be a little more gentle on my hands.
NEG 	It provide good protection for sure and if you have a space grey model then the black is not gonna be noticed that much and it will blend in quite well. The only down side is by daily use sometime you lose the touch sensitivity and afraid by time it will loosen up and this will increase the issue if touch sensitivity, and sure not suitable for swimming or any water exposure as it traps a bit of it and must be dried afterwards.
NEG 	excellent food storage bins. would buy again
NEG 	I like the phones a lot. They were very easy to install and set up. Sound quality and many functions, including intercom and transferring calls internally are good and easy to use. I had one base with a charging wire out of place, but it worked after I bent it a bit. They offered to replace everything, but I didn't want to take them all out and send them back, especially since I got the fifth base to charge.
NEG 	Bought for my 8 yr old son, so far he’s loving it! Learning to play in the schools Uke Troop
NEG 	Product feels like it's well built. Works for my application.
NEG 	Bought this item for my cable collection,have not had a need to use it yet.
NEG 	Love it. Just like the case I had for my old phone and that lasted me 5 years till I got a new phone. So I know this will last me just as long.
NEG 	I was given great communication from the company and recieved my adapters right on time.
NEG 	I always love a Ken Follett novel, especially the sequels to Pillars of the Earth, one of my all time favorites. I enjoyed the well-fleshed-out characters (even the ones I hated, like Pierre and Rollo) and the authentic setting. Rich and engaging as always. I did feel that Column of Fire fell short in the shifting action between France and England. It lacked the connection that we usually have to Kingsbridge.
NEG 	Adorable dress. Sizing is a bit off. My daughter normally wears a 6, but an 8 in the dress fits
NEG 	They are good but more for decoration rather then using them as an actual mirrors. Some of the pieces are small. The biggest surprise for me was that they are not glued to the wall with like double sided tape. They actually need nails or screws to be put on. So when you put them on the wall, they would not be flat with the wall. They will have a slight angle because of the screw. I am still not sure whats better, tape or screw... maybe actually screw is better.
NEG 	Purchased for use on the full sized windows in my finished basement, as a transitional window treatment for the early Spring. Winter drapes, while doing the job for the insulation we need in the North Country (usually until June!), feel too dark. These curtains, in a vibrant grass green, being that pop of Spring color plus the insulation needed.
NEG 	Good knife, what I expect from Cold Steel but in personal preference I like the bowie
NEG 	It is perfect for downsizing your computer space. Study and attractive, I assembled it myself with no help. Instructions were very clear and accurate. My only consideration is that my swivel chair needs to be offset a bit, so I have to scoot it to the left to align it up with keyboard. It’s not a huge problem, and I’m glad I bought the desk.
NEG 	I love the phone case. It looks and fits great. The phone case is perfect. The screen cover was ok. The first one broke while putting it on the phone and the second one will not fully stick to the screen. It works ok and is usable, but not perfect.
NEG 	I need this since when I purchased a couch (site unseen) the images made the color look a gray / brown but when it arrived it was brown and clashed with my black entertainment center and grey curtains. Only 4 stars because the black on one of the covers is faded compared to the other.
NEG 	Very quiet. Easy to refill. Have been using it every night for a month and no white crust has appeared yet. Full tank may last for three nights if is on the lowest setting. I am very happy with it. It has really improved my sleep. I would recommend it. Only 4 stars because I would like for it to have a room humidity measure on display or something just to know what is the right setting.
NEG 	This mattress protector is okay. There's no cushion or softness in this protector. The material is towel like and the sides are made of really nice silk material. I would recommend this if you're allergic to dust mites.
NEG 	Love the blue color! Not super bright but ok. So far all 8 of 8 work, have survived the rainstorms. Easy to install but I did not use the fasteners, I used stainless screws.
NEG 	I got these because i saw them featured (not this particular brand) on a talk show. They are nice, and will keep out the sun from damaging your eyes and causing wrinkles....very cool!
NEG 	Overall very nice chair. The cover that goes at the base of the chair came broken however. Not a very big deal to me though. It is very easy to put together and very comfortable otherwise! Its definitely not meant for a very big person though. I'm about 5'4" and 145lbs and I fit in the chair perfectly but there isn't much room to adjust or shift around.
NEG 	Wish they work better but they helped some
NEG 	Bought as a gift. Is beautiful set, seemed well made.
NEG 	Bought this as my first drone. I was swept away by trailers of drones such as the DJI mavic pro, but wasn't ready to invest that much in the drone scene yet. This is a great starter drone to learn the basics of flying, hovering, fine-tuning, and recording videos. The video feed looks a little stretched on a Samsung Galaxy S7 but it connects without problems. Because of its light frame, it easily gets pushed around by the wind so I haven't flown it too high in the sky yet. Make sure to read the manual before first setup to learn best practices of drone handling and watch some YouTube tutorials! This drone has inspired me to get into the drone scene and maybe eventually buy a DJI mavic pro
NEG 	Family game night fun for everyone
NEG 	Fixed my A/C problem
NEG 	It does the job perfectly. Wide angle view. Video quality for day time is very good. There are some lines on the video at poorly lit places. 400gb storage is a nice feature.
NEG 	Bought this for my wife, she said it's very useful
NEG 	I like the weight and thickness of the curtains.
NEG 	Price was nice and installation wasn't hard either.
NEG 	I would rather have OEM style but these were cheaper and got the job done, some edges were a little wavy, and some pieces overlapped where they shouldn’t have. Made it work though.
NEG 	It's a cute top, the type of fabric makes it kinda clingy. I ordered an XL. That took care of it. Very cute.
NEG 	This is my toddler son’s favorite stacking toy since it builds so high and he loves to knock them down. It is great for working on his hand eye coordination and size comparisons while having fun. My only complaint is that he once put the corner of the box in his mouth and it made the finish come off of the box. The boxes are sturdy and have held up to my son’s rough playing. They will change shape or get messed up if too much weight is placed on them though.
NEG 	Thought it was one piece all the way across but it is 2 short pieces that still work.
NEG 	Quality is lacking. But great price. You will have to wait quite a while to receive it. Overall a good value.
NEG 	This is the second one I buy, I really like the color and the look of it. The only complaint is that it is slightly crooked. It is not completely straight, but it holds my movies and cds good. The other thing is that the adjuster moves very easily and sometimes the movies fall. Other than that a pretty good product.
NEG 	Sized up based on others reviews. Fit as expected, wished to leg opening were slightly wider at bottom, same width all the way. Just preference I don’t like feeling like my shorts are clinging. Also the French terry is much heavier weight than anticipated and would be to warm for summer
NEG 	It does what it's designed to do.
NEG 	Arrived on time. Same great quality one expects for Write Socks.
NEG 	Up to this point I’ve only used vogue and another similar product, and this tomato powder for soup is so superior to the others there’s no comparison. It even makes a passable tomato cream soup with milk.
NEG 	Great texture no shedding wish it was a smaller cap
NEG 	Very sturdy and looks great.
NEG 	Buy one size up because it shrinks in the wash but other than that it does the job
NEG 	Very comfortable shoes.
NEG 	Who has never felt ungainly, strange or generally hindered when identifying with other individuals? I much of the time recommend this book to my clients who have summed up strain, unreasonable pressure, solidify strikes or social anxiety. This guide certainly rolls out you think and improvement something in your life to rest easy and live more joyful. The guide has totally gainful tips how to break free and assemble certainty.
NEG 	This product was easy to assemble and so useful to dry my cooking items. The amount of space i am able to save is amazing. The only issue was it barely was big enough to stand over my sink but good enough for me to keep.
NEG 	The socks are a good gift for people who like Harry Potter.
NEG 	Well written, good characters who I really want to know more about. And Big Jeff is exactly the type of guy I love having for a friend.
NEG 	Product as described.
NEG 	Some relief from bugs. I guess.
NEG 	A little tight over my head. But otherwise great. The material over your ears is soft, blue tooth connects easily and battery lasts a long time.
NEG 	Replaced my original battery in my Samsung S5 due to shortness of battery life. The very next day after charging, I found that the phone had fully been restored and the life of this battery more than doubled.
NEG 	Quick shipping but didn’t fit exactly for my Gigi warmer but I just had to cut it
NEG 	I have only had these a few days, and I’m impressed so far. Yes they have to be cut and programmed however , I was able to get a local hardware store to cut them for 3 dollars a piece and since I did not have 2 original keys, I had to take to a dealer to program. They only charged 77 plus tax for as many as I wanted so I in turn bought 2 more keys and had 4 done. Granted since you don’t buy the key from them they can’t guarantee if they will work it kinda bites but for less than cost of one key at a dealer I was able to get 4 with a little leg work. The only reason for not all 5 stars is I don’t know how study they are in long run for durability they feel just like the original.
NEG 	This is my second Torras case, I love this phone case but for some reason it cracks and breaks really easy. Catherine a representative I spoke with asked for a photo I have attached a photo below, I hope to see this case upgraded and hopefully more reliable in the future! Thanks!
NEG 	Once we finally got this shelving unit up, we love the way it looks in our bathroom! But getting it up there was no easy task. The instructions are pretty much useless, we just looked at the amazon picture to put it together. Also, use your own wall anchors! The wall anchors it comes with are terrible and when we started to put the screw in the anchor slipped right into the wall. Would have been super helpful if it came with some sort of drilling template too. 4 stars for the hassle of getting the shelves up there but they do look good!
NEG 	Stitching that connects band to bralette fabric I does not stretch, which does not make it the most comfortable, but still a great bra.
NEG 	These are strong and won’t bend or damage easily. Polished copper colour looks so classy
NEG 	Great dress. Comfy, fit well & looked great in my daughter!
NEG 	buttons fell off during the first wear of this romper
NEG 	Used around home windows. Serving its purpose. Now all we need is to get security system with cameras and surveillance going
NEG 	I am very pleased with my purchase. The quality is great. It is a perfect learning tool as well as decorative.
NEG 	Better than expected!
NEG 	Really enjoying this mix of throwback music.
NEG 	Not sparkling, but my grill was in bad shape. Worked as expected.
NEG 	I like the product. It is sturdy and serves it purpose. I like the storage compartment also. I am disabled and homebound. I use the tray in my bed. I like to store a silver ware set and napkin in the compartment.
NEG 	Pros: -Good manipulatives to spell out words - consonants in blue, vowels in red - choice of letter y as blue or red (I use blue) - has variation of letter a and g to familiarize students - a good number of letters to use with a small group, differentiated instruction Cons: -Overpriced -Plastic container would have been better with latches and a handle (like the kind used for screws, nails, or jewelry) - Take care to fully close the lid (hear it snap shut) or you'll find your letters spilling out like I did.
NEG 	I like it but wich the mechanism fit tighter. the charger fits tight in the grommets, but the grommets are loose as hell. I might glue them in later but I really don't like using glue when a halfway decent hardware option would have sufficed.
NEG 	Nice tape, easy to read in centimeters or inches, but it is too wide for the edge of kayak so I had to cut it down to size, fast shipping
NEG 	It's a great cookbook with lots of helpful recipes. But honestly, most of them you can find online. Overall, it's a good buy.
NEG 	These crocks are very comfortable, however I had ordered a size 8 (which is my normal size) and had to exchange for a size 9. Luckily, they offer free returns which is great. The color was exactly what I wanted!
NEG 	It's a good game but after the last update it won't work. Please fix it!
NEG 	This was obviously aimed at electricians, my first thought was why doesn't it take the double sided driver tips? Instead of pressing a button to turn it on, you twist it. That's not a very good way to use it, a button would've been easier with the twisting having a lock function to change direction. Perhaps the best thing about this screwdriver is the fact you can charge it via USB. That's the reason I got it but I am debating returning it as it falls short in every category. My black and decker I got for 18 dollars is more ergonomic than this, even if they have a proprietary charger. Edit: I just used this on a jobsite all day and I have to say, the twisting didn't bother me as much as I thought it would, the led light is perfect, and although it doesn't take double sided bits I can forgive that as it chargers via usb. I don't think it's worth $30 but it is not as bad as I originally thought.
NEG 	I bought this for a photographic trip as I usually get eaten alive and thought it would work well. Haven't left yet, but will review after wear. Looks good, fits well and no issues.
NEG 	It's a great product, period! I love the clip and the leather makes it high end looking.
NEG 	It didn't work for me but my husband will be able to use it.
NEG 	The bag is lightweight and has zippered compartments. Love that the wallet attaches to the inside of the bag. Great for me as I an in a wheelchair and cannot pick up stuff if I drop it .
NEG 	I removed a star because this case is beginning to fray at the edges, but I like this case because it keeps my paperwhite slim while still providing protection, and the style is simple but elegant.
NEG 	I would have given 5 stars but the price wasn't much of a savings relative to local stores.
NEG 	Very cute dress for the price.
NEG 	Wasn’t as big as I was thinking but works and looks great.
NEG 	So far this grinder is worth the money. It grinds coffee appropriate to the grind size setting, is not overly loud, and is easy to clen after use. The way the bean container screws on to the base is a questionable design. It works but the threads could be cross threaded easily and I had some difficulty getting the top to click with corresponding grind size out of the box. Once assembled the 1st time, reassembly was straightforward and the pieces appeared to "fit together" better. The unit leaves some static with the leftover grind dust, but this seems common with all disc burrs, the collection container is easy to remove, empty, and clean. All in all, I would purchase again given the price point vs other similar disc burr grinders.
NEG 	It’s good product and way better than sticky role, still I expected the plastic cover quality to be better than this
NEG 	The salt gains are a bit too large and I had to put it in my blender
NEG 	Works great! Better than just a PW wand, but not as good as a surface cleaner. Used it on a small area of a tennis court.
NEG 	This is a fantastic product for sensory stimulation and fidgeting! However, don't expect this product to last for the long haul. I have had one of the balls pop already. With that said, I would buy these all over again.
NEG 	Cute cap really like it. Fits my 4 month old well. Label stained the cap on first wash. I always wash my baby wearable products before use. So remove the brown label before you wash.
NEG 	THE PRODUCT IS WELL MADE AND IT CAME A PROMISED BUT I JUST DIDNT CARE FOR IT.
NEG 	Very nice product no issues putting it together. Everything is solid metal. Not sure why anyone would complain about a plastic screw holding the lightning jack. It allows for stand to adjust to your case to fit on to it. Easy enough looks nice. Cords not being built into or power is a plus in my opinion. Easy enough to replace a bad cord in the future.
NEG 	Nice reusable cover, but difficult to fit around the heal of his cast due to the large diameter of the cast. Would love to have the choice of a regular size, or extra large.
NEG 	So far I am really loving this product. I’ve used it twice since I got it and I haven’t had to reapply yet. The only issue I had was that one of the bottle came with a cap and the other didn’t. So it’s hard to leave one at home and travel with the other one.
NEG 	Can’t speak about durability yet but they’ve been very popular with the kids and have allowed us to play when dark out!
NEG 	Great rod for the price and great feel. With the Stealth reel it’s a winner.
NEG 	Such a gorgeous, whimsical set! Beautifully made. Pros: color is vibrant, smooth and even, no flaws. Easy to clean; hand wash or dishwasher. Fairly sturdy with normal use (someone bent the tines on a fork, not sure how or why lol). Cons: the spoons are odd sizes; one is very large and the other is like a baby feeding spoon. Still use them though. Receive compliments on them often.
NEG 	I brought one for me to secure a door n then l brought one for my mother to secure her door n she like the barking dog sound
NEG 	If security is a big concern for you then I would recommend this pack. If not, there are other packs out there that will be easier to travel with. Seemed that the lack of organization pockets would be nice and minimal, but found them problematic in practice. Never needed to take advantage of the security features so I can't speak to those so much. All in all it was not a bad pack, just felt it could have had a little more organization that is easily accessible from the outside.
NEG 	This book is a amazing book for connect your relation. It can help you to maintaining your relationship.this book save you to harm effect of relation.i love it......
NEG 	Perfect for her costume. Great for the price
NEG 	Worked perfectly and was very easy to install. Keeps you from hitting the wall or other car. I hope it lasts as it seems rather flimsy.
NEG 	Only take away is that you have to charge the keyboard. On the new Zagg models you don't have to charge as it draws from the iPad itself. It is great for the price!
NEG 	My son has severs disease and has a lot of heel pain especially playing sports with cleats. These have really helped. Even ordered a second pair so he could keep one in his regular shoes and one in his cleats.
NEG 	This waffle iron is messy. It leaks out easily, which I expected but super hard to clean off once it does. It leaks through the crack in the back of iron where you can’t clean. There is a slide botton to let you choose the darkness or lightness of your waffle but it’s loose and flimsy. No matter which setting I use the waffles come out super soft. I’ve changed recipes thinking that was why but I get the same results.
NEG 	the product is definitely versatile and good idea to keep around for any family accident. keeping ours.
NEG 	Very easy to install. The only challenge was linking to my wireless. When they say place the camera near the router they mean very near. I had the camera in the same room and couldn’t make that initial connection, until I placed it inches away. After that the wireless connection was fine anywhere in my home. Great product, no monthly fees.
NEG 	Bought for husband and brother they both like them for work and hunting.
NEG 	Pretty flimsy, but does the job.
NEG 	I use this as a replacement water filter for my built in kitchenaid refrigerator. Installation is easy and this fits perfectly into the water filter slot in the bottom of my fridge. You need to run the water for a bit to get the bubbles out of the system and the water will be cloudy with bubbles until this happens. Usually I need to run it for about 10-15 minutes before it clears up and the water is then very clear. I have been using this brand for years and never had any problems with leaking and the water always tastes fresh and clean. Hope that helps you decide what to buy.
NEG 	It arrived on time and fitted perfect
NEG 	In all my years of buying from Amazon and all the packages I’ve ordered, this was packaged with the most care. It was like opening a present. A little pricey but I’m glad I supported this company.
NEG 	I like the way it makes my hair feel. I'm not sure if it really helps keep the curl have only used it a few times. Will know more as time goes one.
NEG 	Just gave this to my year old for Christmas. She loves it. My complaint is that the cutting board does not make any chopping noises like it says it's supposed to
NEG 	Worked well. Very compact for traveling.
NEG 	This doesn't look or feel like an expensive pillow but the price is right. I just needed some stripes to go with more expensive pillows I bought for outside. I tend to use the same pillows and get covers to match the season and this is what I was looking for. I can't say much about the colors because I bought black and white stripes!
NEG 	I was looking for an alternative to regular tortilla chips, and these fit the bill. I do get a slight aftertaste, but it's not enough to make me stop eating them. I won't purchase again because six bags are excessive for one person.
NEG 	This was a gift and sent to a different address so I never actually saw the case. However the person who received said it fits fine. Sorry, that’s all I can say.
NEG 	Looks great, not sure how protective it is though. The edges could've been higher
NEG 	The install was pretty straight forward, however, all the pieces are held in place with adhesive. I’ve noticed that the adhesive doesn’t work as well on slick surfaces. I wish there were holes for a screw mount option. I’ve had this kit installed for over a year now. I’ve had a few pieces get pulled off.
NEG 	Fits in YETI straw top, but a little tight. Hard to stir smoothie.
NEG 	Thank for a good product
NEG 	There isn’t a remote control on this version, very noisy but does give you adequate air
NEG 	This top is soo cute! I wore it on a date to a bar and I was getting multiple compliments about the top from the women there. I am a big girl and it made me feel beautiful. I will definitely buy another one.
NEG 	I only gave four stars because the fabric that lays over the top edge does not extend very far down. If you machine wash this I would recommend air drying flat or hang drying. When I dried it in the dryer it got so wrinkled I needed to iron it and there is nothing keeping the center seam stitched down where it folds over the carrier. Other than that it fits onto the carrier fine. Does what it states.
NEG 	I purchased these lights to show steps on my patio for a grad party. Don't want visitors to trip and fall. Not proper use I know but great last minute solution to potential problem.
NEG 	Full set with carrier as a great starter kit.
NEG 	I love this lotion! It’s thick but not greasy at all. It smells great too. I would’ve given it 5 stars except for the bottle. It’s a fight to get this stuff out of there. I store it upside down and just take the top off, then I squeeze a glob out. It’s easier to work with that way. I was afraid I would crack the bottle if I kept squeezing it with top on. Basically it would be perfect if it came in a tube.
NEG 	I love the material of the cloth...just not the thread used for stitching. I have one specific area that pokes and itches me so badly and I have tried to cut it down but I can't get enough of the thread therefore this bra is useless to me.
NEG 	Not bad for the price
NEG 	As I get older, my flow gets heavier. This has been working well for me. My cervix is so low, I tried to find the shortest cup I could. I had to trim the pull off. I have to cup it around my cervix and it still sits on the vaginal opening. I would rather tolerate that than chance overflow which has embarrassed me many times. It does have a learning curve, but it's not hard to learn and I do not find it hard to remove and clean. I recommend this over tampons anyday!
NEG 	It’s a lot flimsier than I had expected. It’s not a product that could withstand much wear. Descent for the price and looks nice. Does not fit the generic 2oz acrylic paint bottles on lower two shelves which is disappointing for me...but also not what it was made for
NEG 	If you've been searching for this style of glasses, then these are your best buy. Definitely gave me that 'Pinterest' look I was going for, and didn't have that cheap "gold" look.
NEG 	Liked it very much except it is REALLY BIG. Not going to fit under any airline seat, this is as big as a carry-on suitcase. Returned for the Iconic Compact Weekender Travel Bag, which worked very well as my personal item and did fit under the airline seats.
NEG 	Very durable, comfortable and easy to clean. Looks great on my wicker loveseat.
NEG 	Great chair. I bought it for 11year old daughter for her bedroom. Only negative is that it sheds a bit.
NEG 	Decent decaffeinated coffee. Not as robust a flavor, but I think that's due to the nature of the beans that are typically used for this purpose. I'll order it again.
NEG 	Cute summer time accessory with a beachy look. It's made out of a plastic type material, so you are getting what you pay for. The type of quality you would find at a dollar store. It is held on by a string material that I feel could break real easily if caught on something. but no sharp edges and is comfortable to wear. It's a pretty necklace and bracelet to add fun to any outfit. The only warning I would give is it is made for thin people. The bracelet and necklace are very small. To have a dangling effect as it should, it's only suitable for those with very small frames.
NEG 	It’s a book. As advertised
NEG 	Works a lot better than I expected it to, I expected to get entirely ripped off!
NEG 	Want to burn music CDs from iTunes? This drive will fail. Want to watch DVDs using VLC Player? This drive won't play them. Want to burn a bunch of files, or read a DVD full of data - this drive is great. Want to burn a data DVD or a data CD? This drive will do it just fine, at 24x speed. If you want full function, then you need to run Win 7. It's not the drive's fault, it's just the Way Win 10 plays with the drive.
NEG 	Getting used to them.
NEG 	First used this as a sampler from a recent hospital visit. Really like the smell of it and glad it's not greasy!
NEG 	Bought these to paint with acrylics. They took the paint well but were quite thin, so I had to put cardboard on the inside so the paint didn’t bleed through
NEG 	The antenna looks great on the truck and is easy to install! The sun faded the color on it, but it looks better now. The only down side is the sound quality decreases with AM/FM. For me, it’s not a big deal as I listen to Sirius radio and Bluetooth music from my phone. Would recommend this product to everyone though!
NEG 	FALSE ADVERTISING, Amazon says 2300 GPH and the manufacturer says 2000 GPH. In My Book, that's FALSE ADVERTISING! See attached scan of the unopened pump package.... Don't take this as a deterrent, running it a week, on a timer, for about 12 hours a day and it starts up and runs just fine. I have it in my small goldfish pond, about 750 gallons, with a lift of a little over two feet. I would buy it again, if it's still offered, when this one eventually gives up it's ghost. ( The 2300 GPH rating is for ZERO lift. )
NEG 	The material on the backhand is breathable so I've never felt my hands get overly sweaty because I was wearing these. If/when the pair I bought has finally seen its last day, I'll be buying another pair of these.
NEG 	I like it but you have to purchase the licence after trial to use download games.
NEG 	Works well but not the best quality.
NEG 	Returned because arrived handles broken off due to no bubble wrap only loose paper stuffed in a box 6 times the size of red stoneware. Lovely when seen but wILL rethink reordering it 'cause not made in France.
NEG 	It’s okay for what it is. It’s not very heavy but gets tangled easily. I do recommend it for a costume.
NEG 	These worked out great
NEG 	It is missing one star because it does tend to streak really bad but it is not a terrible product.
NEG 	This mystery was fun, with an interesting twist
NEG 	The print looks a little cheap but I got this shirt for a one-time thing. My biggest complaint was the smell. Straight out of the packaging it smelled like straight vinegar. Had to wash a couple times for the smell to fully go away.
NEG 	I use this product for strengthening my upper back and arms. I only use the heavy band and it works well. I doubt I’ll use the other two weaker strengths.
NEG 	Good goggles...but I left them outside and the tint is starting to discolor...comfortable...
NEG 	NEW TO ME RIGHT NOW BUT LOVE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH TV SHOWS AND MOVIES WHEN I WANT TO. I'M ONLY AFRAID THIS NEW PASTIME WILL TAKE ME AWAY FROM WHAT I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF IN MY DAILY DUTIES.
NEG 	Good for the money - but you have to use force to get them apart the first time. After that they're great!
NEG 	Good heavy jacket. However, the bottom elastic band is very loose. Not very form fitting.
NEG 	Just an ok curtain rod. Easy to install. Lightweight. Thin rods. Rods wall holders are easy to install.
NEG 	Good hangers for the price. No damage and arrived on time.
NEG 	Fits okay but does get uncomfortable after wearing all day.
NEG 	My only gripe is that he doesn't have his Rivet Gun.
NEG 	The states are dyed a variety of lovely colors, and are all fairly large. They arrived quickly, and were packaged efficiently. A few have flaws that I think might make them more fragile than I would like, but I am pleased with this purchase and would order them again.
NEG 	So far so good, Goes on easily, goes on dry, feels kind of like a powder. Does not leave an oily residue or leave my pits feeling moist all day like others I've tried. I ordered the white lavender, goes on white but turns clear. Have only used 4 days at this point.
NEG 	Works great! As a realtor I'm giving a flag with this light to ALL my clients!
NEG 	Loved the pattern but was disappointed to find out this pattern was from 2010 and has been discontinued from Corelle so it's hard to find other coordinating pieces.
NEG 	Helped calm down my senior dog. He likes the taste.
NEG 	They are ok. Much darker than I expected them to be. But not thrilled with them.
NEG 	Good power supply. A little noisy but worth the price.
NEG 	This definitely runs small. When ordering your size, be sure to go off your waist size (inches) and not the descriptions of S, M, L, etc...
NEG 	I have to wear shoes around the house for support and these fit the bill. Very comfortable very lightweight hardly know you have them on. If the price goes back down I think I'd probably get another pair.
NEG 	Super cute, but I took one star off because it is see through and I was expecting a solid case.
NEG 	I have use the light in different situations. It’s worked out well each time. For the light to be so small. It’s very strong. Having the remote is a plus. My plan is to get another one
NEG 	Great little device. My only complaint is that it loses sync with my iPad and has to be removed and reinserted from time to time. That said, I’d buy it again because it works. Good for camera bag, etc.
NEG 	Seems durable and good quality, except for the suction cups and adhesive. I will need to get something else to make it stick, they don’t work at all.
NEG 	The color is an antique brass color, not the coppery bronze color shown in the picture. I went ahead and used them because the color won't show too much under the cabinet shelves, but I would not order more. They are the size described and they are strong.
NEG 	Difficult to collapse
NEG 	I like the size, that it clips on a belt or waistband. I wish that the volume control I set would remain fixed after I turned it off and turn it back on again. Unfortunately once you turn it off the volume level used it does not stick. When you turn it back on the volume is always at high
NEG 	I liked this mystery until the end but I think that the language was the problem and for some reason I didn't realize it until near the end of the story. I liked some of the characters but could not give a higher star review.
NEG 	Good curtains. Good quality. Color as described. Shuts out light.
NEG 	I still have wrinkles.
NEG 	This bag lasted for about 9-10 months before it started leaking at the velcro closure. The gap could not be closed because the fuzzy side had degraded and there was nothing for the hook side of the velcro to engage. I am satisfied given the price that I paid. The closure did not fail suddenly, but only after several months of service.
NEG 	I enjoyed this book. It has strong,and intelligent characters. I really look forward to reading more books by this author.
NEG 	Very lightweight, quiet clippers. Our son’s girlfriend is a pet groomer and said these will be great for trimming our dogs’ paw pads. Bottle of oil was missing from our package, not sure if that was supposed to be included but it looks like it was. Otherwise pleased with purchase. Great for pets that are scared of louder clippers.
NEG 	Product was exactly as described. Easy to install. We did however get a bubble in the corner on our phones. But not enough to send back or complain. We are happy with our purchase, and the speed of delivery.
NEG 	The instructions are clear and the installation process was the easiest I have experienced. The cover goes on right the first time. It seems to be good glass, but not that durable. I carry my phone in my back pocket and within only a few days the glass around the lock/ID sensor had become quite ragged. Otherwise the screen looks great and does not affect app operation.
NEG 	Since this is my first pregnancy, I figure I’d buy this pillow to help me sleep as I grow. Saw the high ratings, so I went with this one. The pillow itself is comfy, but it’s so massive it’s hard to maneuver and get it in a position that’s comfortable to sleep in. The one night I did sleep with the pillow, I woke up with my entire side numb from the weight of my arm and the pillow. Think I should’ve went with a smaller pillow just for my legs and not this huge pillow that wraps around my head and neck. I mainly use it now to prop myself up to watch TV and for quick naps...perhaps when I get further along I’ll have more use for it, but for now it’s just at the end of our bed like a pet.
NEG 	Great to find a christian themed shirt. I was a bit skeptical about buying online and this one turned out to be a bit smaller than expected. Ordered two others and those were Gildan which fit a bit better. I will buy from this seller again!
NEG 	I ordered these for my husband. We ordered based on the sizing chart and they were too big. He needed them right away so we ended up returning. We would order again but would go with his normal size. Usually he wears and XL but the size chart recommended 2XL.
NEG 	I got this because my husband always leaves the closet door open. Our closet is in the bathroom so I don't want humidity in there and decided to buy this. My only issue is that it doesn't actually close the door to the point of latching. It does keep it closed, just not all the way.
NEG 	The design of the fan is great. 3 speeds. Easy to operate and not only can you wear it around your neck you can use it as a small desk fan. However, after a few weeks one fan stopped working. I tried a few things but couldn't get it to work. I emailed the company and within 2 days I was given a full refund. So, in my opinion, if you're on the fence about buying these there's some peace of mind that the company will do the right thing if you are not satisfied. I used my refund to by another pair.
NEG 	This wallet is pretty cool! I have had it two weeks. It was a little hard to open the wallet to put in cards. It eventually got a little easier. The keychain is nice make sure it is screwed on there nice and firm.
NEG 	Right size, very sturdy. My only complaint is that the included anchors and screws were not enough for all the brackets in the package. I was only sent enough for two brackets. So if you buy these planning to use more than two of the brackets, you'll need to get more anchors and screws separately.
NEG 	I follow a link on Facebook to buy it. I only wanna have a try. To my surprise, its functions are so useful. Recommend it to DIYers.
NEG 	Decent but the taste is about 3 stars. But beauty is pain right...
NEG 	So.. this is pretty cool laser gun set. PROS: -accuracy and range is not bad -the sounds are pretty good -different gun settings. CONS: -you'll need more than 2 guns to make it fun -big play areas OR if you have tons of rooms in the house -back up batteries needed -reload button over time gets stuck (maybe manufacturing issues) -when you run out of life there's a long wait but you can always reset it turn on/off
NEG 	Great product the only thing u would like would be for it to come with a holder so I can place it next to my sink. Aside from that it's a very sturdy brush and love the extra long pipe brush it came it, very helpful for bottle cleaning.
NEG 	We’ve been using it for > than 2 yrs and have been very satisfied. I’m disappointed that the 10# bag is no longer available. The 25# bag is too large and will go stale before we can use it all
NEG 	Super cute! I ordered for my daughters 21st birthday! She loved the lace! She wore it out that night when she went out with her friends to celebrate!
NEG 	Wish it had more for the price but my rating doesn’t reflect the quality of the flavor...just the quantity. Especially since so many of the star anise was broken apart so I could only use so much. Oh well, that’s why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars; convenience of online shopping
NEG 	Some plants have stickers and leaves that cling to the fabric portion of the glove.
NEG 	I had my eye on this caddy tray for quite some time. I love to soak in the tub for a couple hours, and if you do too, this is a must buy! I love this tray! It also looks very nice. The only con for so far is that it leaves gray paint stuck to my tub where the ends sit. I definitely recommend this caddy tray!
NEG 	I love this bag because it's just what I need! It's like a small duffel bag and has lots of room and it's made of waterproof material which is great for rainy days or just wiping clean. It's more on the casual side so it's not for date night but most definitely an everyday carry all!
NEG 	It's a little noisy, especially at night
NEG 	This 300+ page light reading presented important info re the very serious subject of "casual" tween/teen sexting and the legal implications these families can find themselves in as a result of a seemingly carefree, juvenile practice. Enlightening!
NEG 	I made my own after going thru it fairly quickly. Bought a gallon of orange citrus oil, add water and a little methylated seed oil (or dish soap). Made 4 times the amount for the same price.
NEG 	Tough toy. Dog loved it.
NEG 	Good read. Enjoyed the plot, but too many characters with similar names. If you don't read this in one sitting, you forget who the folks are and have to go back and reread. Anyway, it was an enjoyable book.
NEG 	haven't worn them much yet. They seem okay. Love the heel.
NEG 	Durable, but very tight.
NEG 	Was having fun until they said update and there's no way to do it
NEG 	Does what it says it does and after 4 months of use - remote still works and product is working good.
NEG 	Like that they have aloe in them
NEG 	Another one of Craig Johnson’s surprise endings! I love horses and he wrote a lot about them in this book.
NEG 	Seems like a great prod/
NEG 	not enough noise maker
NEG 	I have long toes and they still fit perfect I have not had them long enough to know how durable they are.I wear toe-shoes all the time
NEG 	When the top surface gets worn you can flip it over to extend its use. Very much recommend. I have to buy two at a time or they will fight for the privilege of scratching/sitting/sleeping on it.
NEG 	Haven't used it yet. Grades based on only practicing with it a little.
NEG 	The slider to close the bags are a little hard to slide
NEG 	Good quality, easy to install but not exactly as pictured. Looks droopy. Is this correct ? Can it be adjusted ? See picture.
NEG 	This is a great read. The characters were more than believable (unlike most books in this genre). It seems I was connected on an emotional level from the first chapter; part of this is due to having lived in Texas. But it's fun, accurate, and deadly. The trafficking cartels have corrupted almost everything. In the book Tom Moreno, is threatened by the cartels and it could destroy everything he loves. I was pulled into this book's plot with ease and also fell for the underlying love story. I'm thankful authors like Ryan Lawrence can publish on the Kindle platform!
NEG 	Everybody loved this hat, random strangers coming up asking you buy it
NEG 	Very nice looking screen protectors! Looks really nice on the phone and still looks very clear.
NEG 	Worthwhile read accounting for the trials of World War II in the Philippines. Not a spectacular narration but a good tale.
NEG 	I managed to get this overnighted for a date night! I was really worried if it would fit or not. The dress got here just in time and overall it was beautiful! The dress does need to be steamed and the material is a little strange feeling but not uncomfortable. I got the small even though the chart said I needed a medium. Super glad I got the small because the medium would have been too big. I’m 5ft 3 and 125 lbs. I don’t know how long the dress will last as the zipper is a little fragil but other than that it’s awesome. When my boyfriend of 2 years came to the door to pick me up, his jaw kinda dropped to floor and he was speechless lol. Score! The dress is conservative yet super sexy in a classic way! Success for $25 bucks! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the sizing chart inaccuracies.
NEG 	These appear to fit a bit smaller.
NEG 	It’s better used for short bursted workouts but it does slightly shuffle around after extended use.
NEG 	We purchased this for our young daughter as she absolutely loves it! The animals prints are very cute and the set itself seems very well-constructed. The only drawback is that the cardboard material which makes up the carrying case is not particularly sturdy and does not seem likely to last being played with.
NEG 	The material used for this item is very nice. It looks kind of like the picture, it doesn't have the little frowny mouth thing though. I expected it to be a little bit bigger but that's not a big deal. The biggest problem I had with it was it was delivered to the wrong house.
NEG 	You could make them small, medium, or large. They were exactly what I needed. I still had some left with air in them 2 weeks later.
NEG 	Used it to install a BOSS stereo, had to use a file to cut some parts down (the kit is a set of general pieces where you remove/cut off certain parts to get it to the size for your specific vehicle). The instruction manual is somewhat confusing to follow along with at first but once I got the hang of it, everything went smoothly.
NEG 	Pretty much exactly what I wanted. Later I may go for something more elaborate but for right now it'll do.
NEG 	Decent moisturizer, it's a little weak for me I must admit. I like my moisturizer less watery. But still gets the job done. I would recommend something with a thicker consistency for dry skin.
NEG 	I bought these for my husband and boys to use when taking our dog out during the winter. They are very warm and have a sturdy outdoor sole. Worth the money, and my guys tell me that the fit is perfect.
NEG 	This is pretty but it is very thin. It would be perfect for a summer evening with a chill in the air but if you want it to keep you warm in the winter? Well it won't.
NEG 	Christmas gift for my son. Works great and is fast! Unfortunately the battery pack connection was a little difficult for him and he broke it after a few days. Connection is similar to a cell phone with tiny prongs... he broke the prong off. Overall great gift, just wasn’t suited for him.
NEG 	The lidocaine is not much help but does cut the lasting burning down a bit. I liked it
NEG 	This is a great product! I love that it is adjustable and sturdy. It does NOT move once in place, unless you force it. The fast charging is very fast, I'm quite impressed! Most vent clips damage your vent, however this design does NOT. I was sceptical about this bc of my past vent clip I do not regret it at all. Why 4 starts....? bc I cant use it with my pop socket 😭 truly is a great product if you dont love you popsocket.
NEG 	Not bad for the price
NEG 	These noodles are delicious! I wouldn't consider them as spicy as the 2x spicy noodles however it was bearable spice level to one that usually consumes/desires spicy foods.
NEG 	Great appearance. Drawers glide easily.
NEG 	Small but easy to use.
NEG 	BECAUSE SCREEN PROTECTOR IS NOT ADHERED TO PHONE, THE SPACE LEFT CAUSES TOUCHSCREEN TO NOT ALWAYS WORK, SO END UP REENTERING INFORMATION. DECIDED TO REMOVE THE PROTECTOR SHEET AND NOW THE CASE IS EXCELLENT. RECOMMEND BUYING SEPERATE SCREEN PROTECTOR THAT ADHERES TO PHONE FACE FOR BEST TOUCHSCREEN AND STILL HAVE PROTECTION AGAINST DAMAGE. LOVE THE CASE ANYWAY.
NEG 	I have used a couple of other probiotics and switched to this one because it is way more reasonably priced. I can't tell if the probiotics by themselves are helping my stomach issues, but I definitely have less bloating and constipation than I used to. In the past, I was constantly miserable. These days, I am feeling a lot better. I will continue taking these probiotics for sure.
NEG 	Curtains arrived on time. Great curtains, bought to decorate my li'l one's nursery wall. Not as sheer as I would have wanted but overall good!
NEG 	Beautiful case. Fits well. I did have to remove the case when plugging a speaker jack into the bottom so I ended up switching to a different case, however I do plan on using this case again in the future. The texture of the back of this case can be slippery just because of the materials used.
NEG 	Work better than I expected it to be.
NEG 	The battery was able to charge my iPhone 3 times before needing to be charged itself. The battery itself took about 16 hours to charge. Overall it worked how I'd expect a portable charger to work. My only issue would be the lack of color but that is just an aesthetic critique.
NEG 	I apply concealer first and the product really stays on and the color pops.
NEG 	Thick, light and good size but just little hard to clean. Awesome graphics and colors!
NEG 	I enjoy reading love stories and historical romantic fiction in my retirement. i chose these book (all three of the St.James siblings' stories) because I like also to see where the characters' stories go after the conclusion of the book. So far as the storyline was concerned, it was really good, as were those of the other two siblings, but I didn't think the episode of explicit sex when David and Vivi finally come together was necessary. And I thought it disturbed the tapestry of emotional and social upheaval that Beck had created. She did this in the other two sequels as well. I would caution those contemplating the book to go with the understanding that, if explicit sex bothers you, dont buy these!
NEG 	Bulbs seem very good, but WOW are they ever bright. Too bright for wher we bought them for but believe they will work in Garage.
NEG 	This worked out very well. I used to use numbers of pillows at the end of the bed, but with this it so easy. Now I do not have to worry of kid rolling over the bed. Its amazing how small things like these make life easier. And the material is awesome. the bottom of pillow has tiny protrusions that help it grip the bed, I guess gives more friction.
NEG 	I bought this for 3 and 5 year olds for 5 hour car trip. They were a hit. Glad I could buy two colors without one of them being pink :-).
NEG 	Enjoyed this book. Interesting characters. Lots of twists and turns.
NEG 	Nice color, very plush.
NEG 	I love the glasses. but I got no case. and after 5 broken English emails I am not sure if they are replacing it or not. We will have wait. the glasses are all metal framed and are just great. Not to dark that you come inside and run into things. they just make everything really nice. I just had eye surgery and needed some glasses. now I do. And with free returns you cant go wrong test driving them. I tried the blue ones too but didn't care for them.
NEG 	This sits on a stand I picked it up by the stand and the stand broke
NEG 	I like that the product has lots of room for shoes but the way it is supposed to adhere to the door (or wall) is ineffective. The tape included isn't very strong.
NEG 	Super comfy, large pockets. Just make sure to wash according to directions before wearing or the black might transfer.
NEG 	Kick stand snapped off within 5 minutes. Overall thr case itself seems pretty durable though.
NEG 	This helps me get designs straight.
NEG 	Discolored quickly - has a grayish brown think after a while
NEG 	very helpful for receipts
NEG 	My son is a newborn and this was the only type of pacifier he liked. He is breastfed and it’s important to me to have a pacifier that he won’t get nipple confusion with. This product is perfect for this problem. I bought this set to add to our collection. We have 6 of these pacifiers, but for some reason we lose them all at once. I previously bought a holder that required me to put the loop through the pacifier hole. That means the fabric of the holder was against my babies face. I can’t imagine having wet fabric pressed against your face being comfortable. When I found this model I jumped on buying it. I will warn you that the holder is translucent and is already attached to one of the pacifiers. I didn’t realize this and thought I threw it away. It’s easy to take off and more to another one. I absolutely love it. I took a star off because the clasp is just so bulky. I wish I t was a bit smaller because against a little baby it takes up most of his torso. Other than that I highly recommend this product.
NEG 	I was very pleased with the tumbler. The overall look of it wasn't super eye catching but we are big golf fans here so the simple design and logo are still appealing to us. (wish it would be available in multiple colors, though) The lid was easy to take on and off. The part of the lid that you can open and close was great! It closed completely and securely which was much appreciated! No leaks! Most importantly, the tumbler kept my coffee hot for a much longer period of time than any mugs that I currently own. This will be great for the cold winter months! The size was just right and it fit in my vehicle's cup holder without any issues. I'm excited to try it for cold beverages, too, just to see if it can out perform the tumblers that I was previously using. My only real complaint is that it's not dishwasher safe. I know it's a higher quality tumbler and made of stainless steel but it can be a pain to have to hand wash at times; especially when I'm in a hurry! Overall, this is a great product, though, and one that I would definitely recommend!
NEG 	I love this brush. My only suggestion would be to re-engineer the lid to a more durable material. It breaks and does not stay snapped fairly quickly. I would create a stainless steel design for the whole tool and make it worth buying. Or, sell the replacement lids separately as parts for .25 cents. It currently is only worth abou $19 to my thinking because of how often it needs to be replaced.
NEG 	I liked that this was a small item and that it plugs into any outlet. The sellers are fanatical about making sure the item works and that you are satisfied with their product.
NEG 	Helps offset overall redness but you need to use a lot since it doesn't have a lot of pigment. I still prefer that over some of the other green color-correctors I've tried. A little green goes a long way so the lighter color is safer to apply, especially if your foundation isn't high-pigment to cover up the green tint. I end up using more but at this price it's not a big deal.
NEG 	They are soft enough for a baby or toddler with a few teeth, without being messy.
NEG 	Fit easily on my face and very comfortable
NEG 	It's a nice sleek phone case but I don't think it would hold up if I were to drop my phone with it on.
NEG 	I purchased these pens and I do love them. However, the dark green pen came completely dried out.
NEG 	I really like this phone. Amazing value for the money. My only gripe is the video output only goes to 720p. Won't find better for the price. I highly recommend.
NEG 	Love the kettle so much I purchased a second one. Wish this vendor was Prime. Ordered white version and received ORANGE so have to waste my time dealing with return.
NEG 	Really soft but absorbent. Very tiny I thought they’d be longer. Over all good buy!
NEG 	500+ TDS before installing the APEC water system.We primarily use it to test the performance of our under sink RO filter.
NEG 	My great niece loves her princess tent! So girly, so cute, you should buy this!
NEG 	So far she I loving it so much. Will give an update in a month on how it's holding up.
NEG 	Thicker fabric than another set I ordered from Amazon.
NEG 	I thought this was a decent continuation and enjoyable read. This book clears the stage for the next challenge of Victory - Lisa Meyers. I also would like to see more of the new man exploits. I gave this a 4 star because I think the battle scenes could have been better.
NEG 	fit wa a little tighter than expected of other Sketchers styles I've bought in the past.
NEG 	Thought it was red but was more burgundy
NEG 	It was missing the shoulder strap.
NEG 	I got it for my new phone, it is petty good but it is a little hard it is not soft
NEG 	I love it, mostly. Just pulls out or pushes in with ease. And cleans really easy with piece of toilet paper. After having it for awhile now it does seem to wanna lean Instead of staying straight up and down with the sink. It really doesn't effect it so I still like it alot. I have the tub one also and it now leans just like the sink one. Still a great purchase in my opinion.
NEG 	These cards are lovely and quite sturdy. The envelopes, while cute with their stripes, could be a bit thicker. The small sticker strips are sometimes hard to remove. Overall, good product I would buy again.
NEG 	A nice inexpensive kit for drilling small holes.
NEG 	Worked well but hose bibs a bit longer than replaced part.
NEG 	This battery lasts a long time and is reliable.Just don't care for the price. However, I did find the best price for it here.
NEG 	They are wider but no more absorbing than the regular overnight pads. They are ok though!
NEG 	I just started the game and it feels fun and I like the story.
NEG 	This is by far my favorite hot chocolate. I am so happy I am able to get it online as they dont sell this brand in any store. near me.
NEG 	Carefully packed to protect book. Arrive on time. A good simple transaction
NEG 	The fabric is light & cool, it seems well-made, and fits almost perfectly. The docked ⭐️ is for two reasons: I can’t imagine this as one-size-fits-all (it’s almost too short, and I’m not a tall person so my arms aren’t very long); and the black one bled dye on everything it touched after *three* thorough washings. 🤞 for the fourth try.
NEG 	There are a lot of tips on how to make the most of every day without having to live in stress and keeping up with the fast pace of the world. I learned that we all need to slow down at times, reflect and take one step at a time. I can say so much about this book. Highly recommended!
NEG 	I bought another ecko shirt a week earlier and it’s the same size of 2x, but this one was way larger. I’m not sure why, but it’s longer and just overall more loose. I’m still going to wear it though, so it’s not that bad, but if I had to redo it then I would’ve got an xl instead of 2x. Like I said, the other one was 2x was perfect. Design is really cool and it’s just like it’s pictured.
NEG 	Awesome read lots of twists and turns and visits to different realms and fairytale characters and some who you think of as good that turn out evil. Awesome storyline and love the variation of the characters
NEG 	It meets my need, happy with the purchase.
NEG 	Just received this product can't wait to see if it works for me stay tuned I will write another review once I've taken this for a few weeks
NEG 	So tiny! But I really loved that about these earrings!! But I ended up losing the both of them after a month or two which I was very sad about. The backs constantly fell off, which was it's only downfall.
NEG 	Early stages but so far it works well for my needs and what it holds. Nicely made
NEG 	Cant as yet determine durability. Small bt seems solid
NEG 	Bags are a pretty blue, but somewhat thin.
NEG 	In two separate lots made in their February and March 2019 production runs, the hardware packages were short spring washers and flat washers. This necessitate a trip to the local home center. Otherwise the product was satisfactory.
NEG 	Great price for a good quantity to stock up on. Unlike Amlactin or other exfoliating lotions this does not burn or sting even when used over areas with irritation or sores. Very hydrating but sinks in quickly. There is a slight smell, but it dissipates in a short period of time. Unfortunately my skin still has quite a few bumps after over a month of daily use, but there is a notable different in how much moisture it retains.
NEG 	Nice design with plenty of room for large toilet paper rolls. Like that it has 4 feet so it’s less tippy. Only issue is the shipping package had too much room in it. It slid around in the box and bent all the feet. I straightened it out and it looks good now
NEG 	Made my hair very soft and manageable but did not help my itchy scalp.
NEG 	I haven’t had the chance to use this, yet. Surgery is in 2 weeks. It feels and looks well made. I have used one on my arm in the past and it was terrific. Hoping this is the same. The leg section is substantial. I am concerned that the top part that fits around my thigh may not be tight enough or strong enough. I’ll up date when I actually use it instead of just trying it on.
NEG 	Very easy to put up especially by yourself. The only true drawback at this time is that it’s not very sturdy at the end where the poles are used. I use mine for my mobile bike repair business and when I use it the back end just falls to one side or the other. I’ll have to get some rope and weights to eliminate this issue.
NEG 	Comfortable, higher waist to keep my booty in check. They’re very long though, I’m 5’7” and I need to cuff them. The only thing I don’t like is that the seams are quite prominent and can be scratchy. After a couple washes it was fine though.
NEG 	Comfortable and thick material in a good way.
NEG 	I hope this is working. I have not seen any snakes around this device. Hence my 4-star rating. They seem to be substantial and well made.
NEG 	Worked as advertised within 3 days, I noticed the cold sores/acne that form around my lips seemed to go away. Not an instant fix but if you give it a couple of days and uses it will work. The tube is super small, and does not contain a lot of medication just fyi.
NEG 	Light weight with heavy weight results. Too delicious
NEG 	Comfy seat. Wish it was longer to better fit my car seat.
NEG 	Like it, but I have to buy an extra cable.
NEG 	I am really enjoying my new study bible. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it does not have the individual book tabs. The bible is offered with the tabs in a more expensive version which I would recommend considering for purchase.
NEG 	works as advertised.
NEG 	great taste; needs to be removed from frig a good while before use, otherwise doesn't mix well.
NEG 	Detail for the mask was great. Used it as a costume for my son (pre teen) and it was a little big, but it states it’s for an adult. Reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the strong rubber smell. I washed it with soap 3 time, made a baking soda paste and used that 3 times. Finally I made a baking soda paste with essential oils and that made it to where the smell was tolerable
NEG 	This is a very effective power bank, it has slightly less battery power than I wanted, but other than that, it's a great product.
NEG 	Not the scent I had hoped for . Love the scent of cedar, but this one missed
NEG 	This product has been great so far. The instructions were very easy to follow and the set had everything I needed to change out my old thermostat. I was intimidated by having to go into my furnace panel and change some wires, but the kit that was provided as well as the directions made it quite easy. The interface is friendly and easy to use. Great thermostat for the price, and the Alexa integration is convenient.
NEG 	I would give it 5 stars, but it did not come with the promo card which leaves me to believe that it had been opened, card was taken out, then resealed. Everything else is great, just really would've liked to have that card.
NEG 	The rest of the accessories are nice but the hat is small.
NEG 	They were a little smaller than I thought they would be, but they are very bright and I love that you can set the motion detector and or dusk till Dawn sensor. Good product for a pretty good price.
NEG 	I use this as a base for top ramen like noodles as I am a vegetarian. I'm happy I found this.
NEG 	It is fine, I wish the color had been alittle different green to have better matched the toilet
NEG 	The product was as I expected... Recomended
NEG 	It's beautiful but way too long for a person my height
NEG 	Little small but great product
NEG 	Well packaged in Mylar sealed bag (wish it was resealable) lots of seeds and will update on germination rate and taste. I’m going to grow this in a hydroponic system. Stay tuned!
NEG 	Scent does not last long but for the price it’s ok.
NEG 	Love these, wish the leather was a little wider around the thumb and index finger. These do fit very well and keep my hands warm.
NEG 	Good shorts, wish the material was a little heavier. Fit was good, followed the other reviews on sizing. Like the draw string.
NEG 	The Devil horns were great for my Halloween project. Just beware there is no adhesive you will have to figure out what you want to use. For this I used a clear Elmers glue.
NEG 	Great stocking stuffer. Hard to find item anywhere but Amazon.
NEG 	Great price. Screw holes slightly off but unnoticeable once it's on. It did come scratched so that may bother you. I figured it'll get scratched when playing anyway lol. Again you can't beat the price.
NEG 	Super cute! Well made and very soft. A lot larger than most other newborn clothes though, going to have to pick out another outfit for hospital.
NEG 	I did not like the white ring on the outside.
NEG 	Enjoyed the storyline. Wish there was more.
NEG 	I love, love, love this jacket. I ordered a large it fit but I wanted room to wear a sweater so exchanged for an x-large. I gave 4 stars because the 1st one the large was missing a button, however the exchange was so easy and the x-large is perfect for me.
NEG 	I like this design and the hex bits fit perfectly snug. I was able to get into hard-to-reach spots installing a motorcycle windscreen. But after light-duty use, one of the bits popped out of the handle--seems the bits are just press-fit into the handles.
NEG 	I've only used them three times this past ice season, but I felt like I could've climbed Everest with them. Im gettimg to the age where if I fall I may break a hip (I'm not really THAT old yet). So far, I'm impressed and fracture free.
NEG 	It is a beautiful wig.
NEG 	I am size 6. I ordered it Large. And it doesn't fit. The large it is as a sizes 2. Is a beautiful skirt and great quality. But doesn't fit at all I returned it and I got xL, is a little big I need safety pin. But quility is perfect.
NEG 	I love that it can combine all of my libraries, but there are certain movies, I think maybe Sony is one, that will not show up with this app. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for that. It actually plays my movies better than they play on the apps that I purchased them on.
NEG 	Only used it once, seems good
NEG 	The flavor of these capsules is surprisingly good. They could maybe be a little richer for my taste, but definitely a good substitute for Nespresso and much more cost effective. The most impressive is the crema! I think it’s better than most Nespresso capsules. I only wish the capsules were made the same way as Nespresso. They sometimes don’t give a consistent brew, but they are better than the last Nespresso compatible capsules I purchased.
NEG 	I like the spray but please make sure that employees seal the top on better. My pkg was damaged and it waisted all over the envelope it was sent in because the top wasn't secured before shipping. Please make sure that never happens to another customer. The spray actually leaked through the plastic covering.
NEG 	Nice quality product. Adhered and stayed on a large abdominal incision quite well. While difference is minimal when you simply touch it, the thickness (probably the reason) is slightly inferior to the highly rated Cica brand. This seems to stick onto itself at edges easier, however, you can peel it back out. In the end, the Cica brand is just a bit more comfortable and easier to use due to the tiny difference. However, I imagine if your wound is small, this would not matter as much. We preferred the cut your own length on this brand while the Cica has perforated preset lengths that you can tear off.
NEG 	Once again the Green Riders are knee deep in intrigue and adventure. Second Empire is hounding the kingdom on multiple fronts and the clash of powers is deadly to many....I can't wait for the next one!
NEG 	This is a good quality sturdy leak proof water bottle. The time markings make me disciplined about drinking lot more water than i used to. One minor thing i noticed - the time marker on the left side should have been 12 pm. Instead it is 12 am.
NEG 	Makes a terrific gift at a reasonable price. My son uses it all the time
NEG 	It looks real. I gave four stars because there were few paint scratches and peel on some of the fruit.
NEG 	Pretty good headphones with solid audio quality. I have enjoyed its use for a few months but today one of the left ear speaker just broke on me. I was wondering if I could get a replacement. If anyone could direct me to the warranty department, that would be greatly appreciated. Can provide pics if needed.
NEG 	good customer service
NEG 	Fits nice and is a nice color, but it already was sticking to my iron as if it couldn't take the heat.
NEG 	My band from Physical therapy broke after a year, so this is a replacement for me. Does slip around it you use the over the door attachment sideways - which my PT band did not.
NEG 	Its a nice compact size for my sump tank with Protein Skimmer in it. And being all plastic except for the stainless screw to adjust the float level.. However it arrived with the float broken off... I was surprised even though I had read the same thing had happened off someone else reviewing it. Amazon was quick to replace it...So it does work..Just hoping it doesn't break and flood my house with water since it maintains my Sump Tank water level...
NEG 	Enjoyable read with reference to Florence Nightingale. As a nurse I enjoyed learning about nursing in this era. Great characters.
NEG 	Good product for the price. Can get very hot inside depending on where you live. Shelves need to be Ziptied down. Overall a nice place to keep some of my plants.
NEG 	Very nice quality for the price. Arrived within 2 days. Pleased.
NEG 	Grand daughter loved this toy!
NEG 	The first was defective, and I emailed the company. They were responsive, polite, and sent a replacement immediately. Be forewarned when initially turned on it can suddenly get too hot which is the only reason to 4-star it. Otherwise, it's a 5 star. After months of daily use and abuse, it's working well and doing its job! The longer length allows me to wrap it around my knee or place it across the width of my back.
NEG 	I ordered these hangers when they were on sale here on amazon & I really like them. I was going to order another set but the price increased drastically so I might be looking somewhere else which bummed me out. I used them to make personalized bridesmaids hangers for my wedding. Very easy to write on & decorate.
NEG 	I am very happy .That just what I needed.
NEG 	Great for comfort in that it’s soft. Drawback is that fog cannot see trough sides. Hence the four out of five rating.
NEG 	Meet my needs and work great. They fit perfectly on my glasses and what I like most is that you can't see the cord hanging from the side of you face because they shorter than most sun glass holder cords. You can pick the size which makes for a perfect fit!
NEG 	This gets hot after inflating the tires of one small SUV up to the recommended pressure for each tire. A bit of a bummer, because we have two cars. But on the plus side, it's cordless. Not having to take out an extension cord is a real convenience.
NEG 	I didn't expect them to fit as comfortable as they do, they fit around leg and thigh area with less pain and I have a low belly muffin....C section scaring and they are comfortably soft and don't rub scar tissue red.... the fabric washes great and they have kept their shape and waist elastic really well......I even waited 2 weeks and bought the product again.....My body can breathe in east coast summer humidity which is great!
NEG 	Gift. Seems to be good quality
NEG 	The size is very small but was good for an infant who will begin walking or beach toy.
NEG 	My son loves this toy. He said it was his favorite Christmas present. Looks just like the picture. My son is 7 and even though there are several small parts he has done well keeping track of them. Only thing is the helmet keeps coming apart but other then that this is a really nice toy.
NEG 	It's a really nice, professional, sleek-looking backpack. It's smaller than I thought it'd be... still enough space for what I need it for but just smaller than most adult backpacks.
NEG 	They appear to be good quality. They work good. I haven’t tried push them to the limit, but I will order another set for the house.
NEG 	I bought this slipcover on a flash deal and that extra discount motivated me to purchase. I have to say... I am pleasantly surprised. Fabric is soft & durable. It was pretty easy to install and looks pretty good. My loveseat is pretty small so there was excess fabric I had to creatively conceal. Overall, this is an affordable solution to cover a piece of furniture. Would be great for homes with kids, pet owners, or folks on a budget that want to give their sofa an easy makeover.
NEG 	Recommend for that retro feel
NEG 	This book grabs your attention in the very beginning and keeps you captivated until the very end. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
NEG 	The rear sight is to wide and needed me to put a thick shim under it so I could tighten it and make it snug. This caused the thing to not line up correctly to sight in. A problem I haven't been able to resolve yet. My mounting rails ,front and rear are standard and measure the same. I tried reversing the two sights and the front works anywhere as it should. The rear sight is to wide and will not tighten up to both sides of the rail
NEG 	works well on paint removal
NEG 	Great continued development of Charlie Moon and Scott Parris - great to encounter a mystery where there are really two lead characters - no sidekicks here. Excellent plot - hard to put down.
NEG 	These are top of the line for the outer material. I had ordered a full size larger, this was way to much. I choose to return the slippers since they were to big and did not replace due to there is no cushion in the sole.
NEG 	Fits well, quality fabric
NEG 	I love this band! It is dressy enough to wear for work but also casual enough that I can just wear it around the house or running errands! I have noticed since I started wearing it that occasionally my iphone screen will go black out of no where or right after I unlock the screen. I think the magnet in the band has been causing issues with the phone making it inconvenient. Also, if you do any sort of lifting or carrying of objects, I've noticed that the clasp will easily be knocked off center of the band making me worried that it might fall off after getting loose.
NEG 	Eat with some pecans and pretend it is divinity fudge.
NEG 	Just what I expected. I'd buy it again.
NEG 	A great book, just wish majoring of books are series. I want to read finish and not be left wondering what happened.
NEG 	I had a cheap case and when my phone hit the street the case exploded, my phone went flying, and landed facedown. She hit and bounce very hard and the screen was shattered in some areas but my phone screen was untouched!
NEG 	Searched youtube for some videos how to reduce the size. Takes some time getting used to but works fine.
NEG 	This safe is exactly what I needed in regards to space-saving size, overall height and functionality. The fingerprint reader is good! I tried several fingers NOT loaded into the database and none could open it. Adding additional fingerprint access is easy. It was easy to attach to floor or wall and the hardware was included. I REALLY wish the power unit was behind the door/behind the fingerprint scanner (would be a 5-star review). You can't see this in the photos, however, or I might have kept shopping. The battery power supply is separate and uses a single plug into the bottom of the scanner. I leave mine plugged in, but it has come loose and fallen a few times. When I plug it back in there are two very loud "BEEP" sounds that I cannot eliminate or silence, which is a problem early in the AM when I'm the only one up.
NEG 	Got this for a friend. He seems to like it. Said it was relatively easy to install.
NEG 	Easy to use and clean. Recommended.
NEG 	I recall the events, but not the true story. Enjoyed the movie.
NEG 	I bought these bottles to use for homemade kombucha. They work great and I actually like the smaller 8 oz sizes. The tops are sometimes very hard to unscrew, which I suppose can be a good thing.
NEG 	Great jacket, runs small. Going to reorder in next size up because I actually LIKE the jacket. Wish the size chart was more accurate.
NEG 	I wore these under an off shoulder dress. The worked perfectly for that. Only reason I gave a 4 is because they irritated my skin. Other than that I recommend them.
NEG 	I love this toy but I am somewhat surprised it's made of plastic when it takes so much abuse. It was a tiny bit bowed when I got it and I imagine that will only get worse with time. I do really love the idea of the toy, and my daughter enjoys it. But I think better materials could be used.
NEG 	Absolutely love this product for intense moisture. I feel like my lips are softer and look fuller after a week of using this nightly. Thick, almost vaseline texture with no smell or taste.
NEG 	It's not really kid friendly. Watch before allowing children to watch. Language and sexual situations. But funny for adults.
NEG 	Instructions are a little vague , and not very intuitive. Website for update very slow. Requires PC, no MAC. But once everything got updated and I figured out the instructions, the unit works great.
NEG 	Package was damaged, but item was ok. Not packaged properly.
NEG 	Necklace is good quality. I wish there is an option for smaller pendant like 20mm, and 25mm.
NEG 	Wanted a more structured boot
NEG 	Works ok ,nice long handle ,it needs to have bend at head so it won't touch truck.
NEG 	Although the scope was smaller in size than I expected. The view is clear, sharp and easy to focus. I found it important to start with 20 and the increase the power after locating the subject. I liked the fine focus located on the barrel of the scope. The smaller size has the advantage of being easier to carry while birding. I prefer my full size tripod rather than the included tripod.
NEG 	I am 5’9” 150 lbs. It is a stretchy jersey like material. A little tight up top, but not an issue for me- i’m not busty. But the 4 stars is because the dress is shorter in the back than in the front. Other than that, I love the green color and it will look great with a sweater and/or scarf for winter :)
NEG 	I love this T-shirt !! I collect them of places I have traveled to. The shirt is very nice, not a heavy Cotton like I’m used to. I purchased a 2xl according to the measurement grid they provide. It fit, bit had to do a little pulling and stretching. Size up if you like your tees to be a little looser. I kept mine and just love it.
NEG 	I LOVE that this product is cruelty-free which is a must. It provides light-medium hold, with no stickiness at all, hair feels very smooth. Not as much hold as I'd like, as I have thinning, fine hair but I'm sure it would be great for those looking for less body/hold.
NEG 	The shaver is well built and has lasted many years. The downside is that it takes many passes to get a smooth shave, and is therefore a bit labor intensive for tasks like shaving one's head. For just shaving your face, it would be fine.
NEG 	Got this for Valentine's Day for my Hubby. Works perfectly considering the size. He likes it very much.
NEG 	Pros: 1. Covers well 2. Material seems of good quality Cons: 1. doesn't look as tight and neat as I would have liked it to. 2. Takes a while to install, especially if you want it to look good.
NEG 	Pattern doesn't seem as bright as pictured but still nice, love the theme.
NEG 	plan on taking some time but adds lots off extra space
NEG 	Good construction and I like the clip on the case where I clip it to my belt clip.
NEG 	Great size...good for a quick spot
NEG 	I thought the inside would be more entertaining and have more going on. its basically a picture and sayings in the middle. Its not mixed in or really a mandala inside at all. But it served its purpose.
NEG 	This was a gift for my nieces. It's in their room as a night light they quite love it
NEG 	Shower shoes for hubby. He says they work fine.
NEG 	Worked great on my pool. It kept my pool warmer than it has ever been. This purchase was a replacement for this exact cover I bought a year ago. It's essentially a one year cover. Last year's cover was too brittle to use this year. But for the price, it's so definitely worth it. I'll just buy another one next year!
NEG 	Although a bit flimsy the fit was good and is comfy looks nice. Has a nice long length.
NEG 	These earrings are very very cute and super light weight. However, the post are SOOO sharp. I have an infant who loves grabbing at my ears so I can’t wear these as often as I’d like. He would definitely hurt himself
NEG 	I am a pocket lover of dresses and skirts and this fits the bill, the only thing is it is cut in the front in a way that is shows some of my racerback bra.
NEG 	While the box says Classic- this is not the game I remember playing as a kid. The pieces may be correct and the game board may be correct, but the houses/hotels, money, chance/community chest cards... they aren’t the same anymore. First of all we keep running out of money- and we’re only playing with 2 people! Then the houses are too big to fit 4 on a property and if you want to put 4 houses on more than 6 properties there aren’t enough pieces. I’m sure the cards/money have all been updated to new materials, but I loved the old card stock that was used. We are glad to have the classic version of Monopoly, but we definitely miss the classic feel to the game.
NEG 	Good for Halloween and Christmas. Can’t wait to set it up for Halloween. It comes with different projection pic for Christmas and Halloween. Easy install. It has timer settings. You can use it either indoor or outdoor. It plays music too. The only thing I don’t like is when you turn it on, it plays Christmas song on a Halloween projection and there is no music downloaded for Halloween. The projection should have been scattered instead of showing one at a time. Not bad for Halloween though.
NEG 	Awesome product! It’s cute and very functional my only complaint is I wish the hook on top was larger because it doesn’t fit on my rods. This picture is my bathroom shower rod granted it’s a sturdy rod. It’s the closest one that fits
NEG 	The pillow is too plump and hard for my comfort
NEG 	When the mattress pad came it was unzipped in its original plastic packaging. It was dirty. So I washed it and put it on the bed it definitely has a cooling effect to it. because I have a TempurPedic mattress it seems to hold in the heat this. my husband seems to think that it has made a huge difference for him. The fit for the king size mattress was perfect and it washed great?
NEG 	The hair out of the pack is very soft & silky. Hair has a slight smell to it (hopefully it will wash out). The bundle are very thin. Im going to buy a scale because there is no way these bundles are 100 grams. I will be updating after wash then another after install! Update: I was able to wear this hair from mid July to early September. The photos show the hair from initial install to last week on use in order. Hair comes back to life after each wash but starts to get more and more tangles. The hair sheds like crazy the hair wasn't as full as I like but was well worth the price. I will buy again
NEG 	Everything was fine just had to buy the line and connector to hold the shower head. But it works fantastic now I have all the parts.
NEG 	Like the way they look while wearing them, but they are Very Fragile
NEG 	It's a g2 belt, and it's good quality. Works great in my 3d printer, with lots to spare. Why are you smelling it?
NEG 	Good flip case wish it would stay closed with magnets.
NEG 	Using it for a raspberry pi. Although a might small for a older pair of eyes to read detail, it is quite good for IQ. It also will serve as part time monitor for a Roku in the spare room.
NEG 	Using for small remote I keep outdoors. Waterproof, but I do have a condensation build up inside on occasion.
NEG 	Two of the 5 rods were broken into several pieces upon arrival.
NEG 	The thrills keep coming for Alex Vane. And I enjoyed this, since it is somewhat timely with the cybersecurity aspect. Not to mention that I work in the field. Made me not want to put it down.
NEG 	I am a big fan of sketches of people and faces, but I am honestly quite terrible at mixing different realistic skin tones, especially if its as messy as watercolors. This is great for coloring practice really! And saves a lot of time even if youre a pro
NEG 	Liked the different side options.
NEG 	First of all.. I've read all the reviews. I had previously purchased some other brand chinese LED lights that did not work at all (there's three rows of LED on that one.. avoid them..).. I eventually settled on these even after reading reviews. At first when installing.. only 1 row on one worked, and both on the other.. the 1 with one row had a pin not connecting nicely (ground).. that was easily bent into a better position and fixed. I taped the connector once over with electrical tape, then used a flat head (with some struggling) to push the connectors deeper into the mirror one at a time. Making sure the lights are working I pushed the lens into the mirror, they DID NOT snap tight.. if I slightly pushed it they'd come out.. this was a no go.. what is happening is the latch on the LED lens is not seating itself.. so what I did is pushed it in all the way, and then on the mirror side (with mirror turned up and away) I used my flat head and forced the latch to seat itself (it takes some force, it won't break the latch) and once it's seated.. the lens isn't going ANYWHERE, highway, bumps or not.. so far so good. They fit and look GREAT. Just a little hassle with the wiring, and getting the latch to seat itself so they stay securely put.
NEG 	just what we were looking for scooter
NEG 	This is better than the seat covers I have purchased in the past. My family does a lot of road trips and that means we use a lot of bathrooms. These covers go on the part of the seat between the lid and bowl which means that you make no contact with the actual toilet seat. Now I can finally stop cleaning strange toilet seats to protect my girls from contacting nasty toilet seats. Wish I have found this product earlier. My children take these to school with them to use whenever using the 🚽 at schools and I can finally feel safe that they will not be sitting on any dirty toilet seats.
NEG 	They are bright but mine are opposite my high beams point down instead of up.
NEG 	Over all happy with my purchase. Not strong enough to crush ice but does it's job.
NEG 	Very comfortable. Soft texture. Reclines without a problem and helps to assist to stand at appropriate height.
NEG 	They were smaller than expected, but they work perfect, and the air stays in them for a long time. I mean months.
NEG 	I am a very avid pokemon go player and play outside a lot! I needed a pair of gloves that would allow me catch those pokemon and these gloves are it!
NEG 	I love this color and purchase it often, but this is the first time I have purchased from Amazon. The pro: it brightens up my face without being too sparkly and stays on all day. The con (and this seems to be exclusive to the Amazon version): it arrived in a much looser powder than the version I have purchased for years, in-store, which makes it messy to apply. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.
NEG 	This is a good looking bird and it works well. Like most folks, I’ve had some issues with the tubing, but it is easy enough to change, came with extras, and is readily available.
NEG 	they work fine, will see for how long
NEG 	I have used this for a week and can already see a difference in my split ends. My hair look healthier! Helps control frizz! My hair has more shine then ever. Has a nice soft smell isn't overwhelming like most!
NEG 	Works great on the series 1. The microphone holes don’t line up perfectly as I assume it’s designed for series 2 or 3 but haven’t noticed issue. Other than that it fits great and is well made and a good look. Only issue for me Is it is REALLY tough to push the band release button so if you change bands often you might be disappointed. It definitely works just pretty tough to get it to release the band.
NEG 	The shirt would go too far up into the armpits area, but it was not something that was extremely intolerable.
NEG 	Purchase these screen protectors with the camera. They were packaged nicely and easy to apply. They seem well made and should work.
NEG 	This is well made, the kaleidoscope display itself isn't great, but it works.
NEG 	Much bigger than expected but very nice and well packaged no damages or faults
NEG 	if I gave a 5star this would be one but nothing is perfect-lol
NEG 	Not bad for the price. Sound is clear and good bass. Battery kinda sucks but look at the size of it
NEG 	Will never stay connected to WiFi and the app is pretty worthless. 0 times have I logged into the app and it was usable.
NEG 	This wig has been great. It is a great lace front for beginners, because it's so easy to work with! The baby hairs and pre plucked hairline is a great bonus, the baby hair is a little long, so that you can cut to your preference. Because of its length it does tangle a little, but it was a great wig for a night on the town!
NEG 	First thing’s first: this set is BEAUTIFUL. Everything shines perfectly in the light and makes all of the colors pop from the black covers. An amazing addition to any collection and to anyone who frequently plays the game, as these even have all of the updated errata to game rules. Whether it’s on a shelf or at the table, it’s gonna turn some heads. Now, onto the unfortunate bad. The printing of these editions clearly has had some issues, as I found minor ink stains in the spine on ~5 pages throughout all 3 books (The one pictured is the largest stain I found). The DMG also had pages that got folded up during printing which made them look like... that. Nothing which can’t be solved with a bit of cutting, but it’s still good to be aware of. There was also minor cosmetic damage to the outside of the box, but I’m not so concerned about that. If you get this set, inspect every page thoroughly for damages, but what you’ll be left with is a very special set of books!
NEG 	Excellent Customer Service!!! the light its very bright and intense, the one I bought stoped working after a few months but they send a New one as soon as I told them!!! great Value
NEG 	These towels are lightweight and dry quickly soft and pretty good quality for the price
NEG 	I love how it straightens the hair,but i dont like the fact that it keeps locking as i flat iron.
NEG 	Very stretchy. Falls to knee and I got a small and I'm 5'8". Needs wrinkle releaser or a warm iron after washing/drying.Zipper seems a bit weak and will prob go before I'm ready to part with this cute skirt.
NEG 	Great value. I wish the tops were attached to the base. No leaks or issues. Perfect for my event.
NEG 	Nice, compact case, light weight, and has a soft interior. Good price point and product. The soft fabric inside is great because it doesn't scratch my computer casing, however, I often find microfibers stuck inside the computer screen. I wish it had a small handle. Other consumers complained about the metal logo scratching tables/counters/surfaces. I have not experienced this problem and isn't a concern for me.
NEG 	Turns out the chairs don't require any screws. It's super easy, there are literally four pieces that slide into each other through the use of tracks. We ordered in bulk for our conference room which is great because I'm the only person putting them together. I'm a little weary though because assembly is SO easy. How sturdy are they for the long run?
NEG 	It looked more shinier in the picture and in real life it's not as bright
NEG 	This is only for last minutes planning. You can get the same brand at Costco for double the quality you get here. This is a rip-off!
NEG 	It was easy to setup even without a manual. It has a clear picture both night and day. The only negative things I have to say is that I wish the movement was in smaller increments and the two-way audio was a little louder. Even though I only gave it 4 stars I like it enough to buy another one.
NEG 	Haven't used yet but seem perfect for indoor dodgeball
NEG 	Fit is very good, it's comfortable, and looks good on my 65 year old fat bellied body
NEG 	I think this is a bit better than the standard band
NEG 	Make sure you order one size up. It’s a snug (good) fit. The fake fur collar was awful. Matted and not classy looking at all. The coat looks much better without it. Overall, a great buy.
NEG 	Doesn't ring very loud. Have it set to high
NEG 	At first I thought 'where is this going'? Seven pieces of the moon? Twists lead to understanding and time leads to a story I'm glad I stuck with. That's all so I don't give it away.
NEG 	Very good self tanner!! Comes with everything for easy application!
NEG 	I loved The dash diet weight loss Solution. Never hungry. I would recommend this diet. Also the menus are well rounded. Try it. Has lots of the information need thanks.
NEG 	The older design was better, it provided more coverage of the screen as a whole. The new design leaves the glass above and in between the front facing camera and speaker exposed. This was my go-to screen protector, but I may need to find another.
NEG 	Love this shower curtain! It spruced up my bathroom perfectly! Great material and great design. I’m so glad I purchased this!! Thumbs up!!!
NEG 	nice look and temp seems rather accurate (I'm comparing with my older thermometer). one star off is the display seems a bit busy with all the max and min numbers which i haven't yet figured out what there the numbers relatives to.
NEG 	but can see threw it and its flat not circled shaped i just put stretch shorts under neath that matched her shirt solid color
NEG 	So far, I really like this product. In SW Florida you can be overrun with underbrush, especially on unoccupied lots. This is really good at cutting items that a chainsaw is too large for, and loppers would be too slow. One downside: I 'really' needed the included sheath with belt loop holder, well, the top of the loop just tore right out after 5 minutes. Unsure how to proceed with carrying now.... Just a little frustrating.
NEG 	I love the easy to use case. You can pick a deck and slide it in and out without any problems. The only reason I did not give it 5 starts is that one of the magnetic clasps came loose the 3rd time I used. Simple fix but...
NEG 	It’s a nice watch, attractive and well made but way to many features and too complicated for this simple guy.
NEG 	Very nice jersey, love the material but the elastic on the arms are a bit too tight.
NEG 	It seems that when you are rigging things, you always need something else. This was it.....Great!
NEG 	These are very cute, just know that the toe is very pointy.
NEG 	The only downside is the material is very stinky, chemical toxic stinky. So strongly suggest you put it away in a good ventalation area before you start using it.
NEG 	They came late but they cute. This my third pair!
NEG 	Case broke the moment I opened it
NEG 	Item is the perfect size for both my 3 year old and for my 10 month old. However, for my 10 month old, they were a bit too tight for my comfort level, to keep them on her head, as my 3 year old said they were tight on him...prior to me adjusting to make them bigger. The pressure still made me nervous for my baby girl. Noise level, my 3yo said he couldn’t hear me and I was talking pretty loud. The only reason I returned them is because I ordered them in the green, expecting a mint color and they came in a grassy green color.
NEG 	Great game for me and you.
NEG 	There are separate color sheet, you can color or paint on them.
NEG 	helpful streching my back & in other forms...
NEG 	They are ok, not the best.
NEG 	First order of this item when received was opened and had spilled. Call and received a replacement in no time at all.
NEG 	nice quality for the price
NEG 	Really liked how easy this case is to put together. With the glass screen protector its 360 coverage. The downside is this glass protector. Its not full adhesion. Its only double sided tape around the edges. I really got it centered and it seems to be holding fine for now. Its a great deal for full coverage and the case alone is worth the price. Update: 11 17 18 The case is good untill you remove a few times then it WILL break at the tabs that hold it together! If your planning to nvr to remove this case then it should last awhile.
NEG 	I got these for my fiancé. he is a chef and they have been holding up pretty well so far. But thy loose some star not arriving when promised.
NEG 	Awesome and comfortable.
NEG 	works well. Dont like the fact you have to unhook part of band for it to fit. But otherwise does it's job.
NEG 	This fan is MUCH quieter than the contractor grade fan installed when our house was built. It was easy to install and its instructions were clear. It's not as silent as I had hoped but it is really good. My only regret is that I did not replace the contractor fan earlier.
NEG 	Nice looking lock Not hard to install Some of the crews are hard to screw in on the sides
NEG 	Purchased this for my daughter. She is pregnant with twin and it really has helped her sleep well through the night.
NEG 	Love these!! Four stars just because of the price. They are a little expensive but so absorbant!
NEG 	Worked great, all parts were in the box!!!! Be advised to assemble it where you plan on using it because it’s big and took 4 of us to move it after we assembled it.
NEG 	Easy to install and work with. Just have to take time to find the right level to hinder the barking.
NEG 	As long as you have a really good WiFi connection, it works well. High quality picture during the day and about 5 feet of high visibility at night. Major draw back is trying to save a clip. I needed several minutes of recorded video for court and every time I set the clip up with the time I needed, it automatically went back by two minutes and recorded one of those minutes instead. I tried repeatedly and could not get the video I needed to save. Somewhat defeats the purpose of having it.
NEG 	The earings are much bigger than I had expected. I was hoping for something a little more dainty
NEG 	Very cute towel with vibrant colors. My issue is its not really soft? Disney Store has better quality and cheaper during the summer months. My little girl Love's LOL, got it mainly to make her happy.
NEG 	Nice fit to my Trek DS 4. Tight and snug. I do not use the top compartment. In Florida, my phone overheats in it. No problem with the rest of it. A solid 4 or maybe 5. Pending on how you look at it.
NEG 	Not as soft or cuddly as I expected from Gund.
NEG 	Doctored up; this could be great stuff (mix it with peanut butter, or put some juicy fresh pepper mince in it). On it's own; as a topping for a pork chop; I'd prefer Tabasco brand chipotle. -That could be improved with doctoring also though.
NEG 	Good quality as far as I can tell. I used two of them to connect satellite speakers to my Vizio 5.1 soundbar. They fit VERY snug, and arrived in a bag within a box with a piece of Velcro included.
NEG 	Got this to add to a costume for a fun run. Fit a little on the bulky side but served it's purpose.
NEG 	Works great. Small but great for small gathering use. Easy to take out and use anytime. Kids love it!
NEG 	One size doesn’t fit all. Other than that love the hat. Sturdy material is great for my 4 yr old.
NEG 	Born to be Different is a cute book that teaches about the differences in people. The story is short with simple illustrations and a positive message.
NEG 	It's good, I think. I don't know if adding more memory actually made much difference in the functioning of my computer. Service from the seller was excellent.
NEG 	I bought this to connect my laptop to an extra monitor, works smoothly.
NEG 	The pens work nicely enough, but unlike most pens, the pen caps won't stay on the back of the pen. As I suspect many people do, I tried to place the pen cap on the back of the pen so as not to lose it when writing, and it doesn't fit snugly and just kind of wobbles around there.
NEG 	Not as full as I expected or as pictured
NEG 	This is the third one I have purchased. It last about 2-3 years and gets a lot of use. It is the most comfortable float for sitting and floating around the pool with a drink. It will deteriorate faster if you leave it in the sun, we store under roof. Good quality. Not a kids toy as the mesh can be ripped, but this is mine and I take care of it.
NEG 	Worked as specified!
NEG 	a good read .... it does stand on its own when compared to Agatha Christie but the story had too many points of comparison to Christie's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE
NEG 	ALL IS GOOD, EASY TO INSTALL, MY ONLY ISSUE IS WHEN I TRY A CUSTOMIZE PICTURES IS NOT UPLOADING? PLEASE HELP ME HERE, DO I HAVE TO CHANGE ANYTHING BEFORE I UPLOAD? HANKS...RAMON
NEG 	Works well and is compatible with the Alexa app. No problems controlling through both my 2nd and 3rd generation Echo Dots.
NEG 	Packaging was perfect, it arrived on time & in perfect condition. Wonderful experience with a company who was also the absolute lowest price.
NEG 	I think it's the fact that I have hair that the hat doesn't fit well. I know it says women's but my brother actually took over my hat and it looks better on him than me. Any who, good material.
NEG 	I have carefully read this guide and extracted a lot of knowledge from it. Which has been instrumental in shaping my career. Moreover, I was able to learn the programming language and manage applications very easily. Thanks.
NEG 	Good solution for replacement part no longer made.
NEG 	Movies don't always have to mean something, sometimes you need a good laugh! RIP John Candy :-(
NEG 	This is a good product for the price. It is very sturdy and well made for a budget tee. The two things I would like to see in the future would be the ability for other toppers such as a brush. Also, being that this is most likely used as a travel tee it should have a bag. Other than that it is a great product.
NEG 	The hat I received is not the same as the picture. But dad liked it.
NEG 	Was what I needed for a theme party
NEG 	Happy with the design & quality. The glue was not consistent on the product. Pack had 4 and 1 of them was not good enough to stick. Luckily I only needed 2 so I yet have a spare.
NEG 	Works great with chicco fit 2 infant seat
NEG 	This is a good dog food container. I use it for refrigerated dog food. A handle on top of the container would make it a lot easier to move the container in and out of the fridge.
NEG 	Very comfortable. Wide headband. Wide range of adjustability. The only problem I had with them is my glasses are quite large and get stuck inside. I must take off both the goggles and my glasses and then pry my glasses out of the goggles. I have this issue with most of the goggles I have used so it's just something I have gotten used to. Fast delivery and well packaged. I will order again.
NEG 	It's really comfortable, but the size I got according to chart (34D) is not good for running. It fits nicely if I were to just wear it around the house, but for high impact exercise I'll probably go down a size.
NEG 	Love Acer's...this is my 6th one... I up grade and give older tablets to others..this is middle of the road not hi end but good for Bible study.... bought two and one the touch screen is not very sensitive...really have to pay attention.
NEG 	Does it's job but collapses when you use it. Can't press up against your head when using to get a good curl but it works.
NEG 	So easy to use! I wish it didn’t take 4 minutes for each pancake/waffle but not a huge deal. My only suggestion is to make sure you spray the plates with Pam in between each pancake/waffle or they will stick.
NEG 	Pleasure to order from Amazon. Cannot find the refills in stores anymore.
NEG 	Long lasting and sturdy!
NEG 	I definitely have more energy while using this product
NEG 	the title certainly does not over promise -- no lack of clear examples where the author distills the subject matter into 1 liter of hard to swallow Russian vodka in a plastic bottle.
NEG 	A bit hard to put together, but otherwise really nice.
NEG 	It’s such a cute and durable cover. My only complaint is that it only slides through 1 watch band. Making the side with ears easy to knock over. It was a pain to wear at Disney. I had to constantly be flipping it back. But it was good material and very cute. If not for that only flaw.
NEG 	Great item. My 9 year old loves it. Easy to use and reliable!!!!
NEG 	My 5 year old daughter got this for her birthday and loved it. The item is well made and worth the money.
NEG 	It appears to be a reasonable product
NEG 	Rated 10,000 hours. 20 Mbps read and write. I tested this out and only got around 15 Mbps read and write. For the money and specs, the Samsung is a better value. Yes, you don't need fast speeds but when you are copying files for backup or uploading to YouTube, the read speed helps a lot.
NEG 	Looks good, with a bit of loosed grasses
NEG 	Bright as shit. Easy to install but it’s vey flimsy
NEG 	Although the original picture displayed a white headband with palm, the headband I received is pink. That is the only reason I am knocking this product a star. The product came is very nice quality packaging and was soft to the touch upon opening. The product is easy to use and to clean when necessary. Great product.
NEG 	I was generally pleased with this two pack of tees, made of an easy to wash microfiber fabric. The fit is true to size. The only negative is that these tees are really LONG. Don't get me wrong, I like a tee that covers my tummy and back end, but this is almost a min dress! I am 5'6" and this tee is really almost too long on me. On a shorter person it would be impossible.
NEG 	The screen keeps having technical difficulties by cutting to black at frequent times for a few seconds and I’m not sure why
NEG 	Great for recessed or track lighting Dimmable LED White to Color. Doesn't produce Green and Cyan well but other colors are good. These also come in PAR models also (with pins on bulbs) For table lamps I recommend the A19 Hue models for a natural look.
NEG 	This is a great little dress that doubles as a coverup for me. It tends to have a lot of static if accidentally put in the dryer but overall it's a nice easy summery dress.
NEG 	Check pharmacy prices and you will realize what a great buy these are.
NEG 	Nice easy to put together took time but not difficult
NEG 	The teeth looked good, but wouldnt stick. I even tried denture cream.
NEG 	The high-pitched noise as well as the vibration helps to distract my dog. Unfortunately, the collar does not work consistently. It is also too big for my dogs neck, so it is difficult to make it work all the time. We do like it better than other bark collars then we have had in the past.
NEG 	This is a great way to clean up the laundry room, I installed it and as its not secured on top it did flex out a bit at the top, but I just anchored it. Also the shoe horn to fish the dryer pipe through is not really effective, it just seemed to elongate the dryer pipe as it put pressure the pipe would flex and not fit the hole. I just used my fingers. But the finish is great and the product is sturdy and durable. Removing the existing 90 on my dryer vent really improved drying, and allowed me to clean the dryer vent pretty easy.
NEG 	Like Harry Potter and Cole Phelps made a book together, love the series
NEG 	It was a good read but I won't recommend it as a reference book for SQL. Content could have been better.
NEG 	Very cute!!! Not completely as I thought it was going to be though, but for the price completely adorable!! Pretty good quality and it's like a rib tank part for the top but still super cute. Will work great for her costume! <3 fits true to size
NEG 	Would have liked it to be just a little bit taller...she doesn't play with it much because it is so close to the ground, I think.
NEG 	Very satisfied so far - Does the job perfectly well! Already tested under various weather conditions including Partly Cloudy... Have used on a highway under a bright Sun and everything was fine, drove into the tunnel - and everything was still great... Alleys with trees on the sides have always been a big issue for me.... Now they are not! Only one downside so far is that when you fold it after use, its legs are touching the lens - might create scratches as time passes - That's the ONLY reason why only 4 stars... This is something the developers of the product have to think in the future. Everything else is just great!
NEG 	Wish there were more ventilation holes in this, but otherwise its a good product. Fits a standard size litter box, not a deluxe one. Wipes clean very easily. Sturdy. One cat was too fat for the hole, but that's not the products fault :)
NEG 	Easy putting together. All the parts were there.
NEG 	The controls are a bit confusing so read the directions but I'm sure it's made that way so that your kid won't mess with the function...but then second day I couldn't get it to the timer mode so I am a bit confused..otherwise I am continuing working on this with my toddler but he likes to take it off so I wish there was a way to make it more secure..otherwise the alarm is a little song...but my toddler does know it as the potty watch!
NEG 	Nice case overall. Responsive buttons. Good feel in the hand. The silver color just looks "off" to me, not quite what site color looked like.
NEG 	0.25 oz is small, but I knew that because I read the description, so no complaints about that from me. I got all three different types as described, and I like all of them ,but creme brulee is my favorite and smells wonderful. Great size to carry in purse.
NEG 	Works well on my stove when I broke the knob is a little jit smaller then I thought. But it does the same thing the original did so it works out
NEG 	This made my skin noticeably smoother and brighter. I loved using this stuff! I applied it once in the morning before makeup and once at night. I cannot use it now due to prescription face cream. The ingredients do not mix well with my new night cream. The only negative I have is the smell. The smell is horrible and is made worse when paired with sweat or makeup. So don't be alarmed if you start to notice a weird smell. I would describe it as medical gloves. Weird, I know.
NEG 	Well built item that seems very durable. Holds cards as it should. I haven't tested its waterproof~ness but I'm sure it's at least water resistant.
NEG 	Works well but the flavor didn’t get my dogs as excited for teeth brushing as other flavors have.
NEG 	I like the leash, but the foam handle ripped off after about 15 uses. I bought the leash 2 months ago, how do I contact the seller for a replacement?
NEG 	Good product at a good price.
NEG 	Got the job done, and was fairly easy to use. I would like more information on all the options.
NEG 	It started out slow, but enjoyed the hunt,the game of love. Society rules,and women exploring their freedom secretly. Best of all the adventures, action that finally exploded at the end, great ending.
NEG 	It seems to be a good deal. I haven't had top use it and hopefully won't, it's a warranty.
NEG 	This is for a gift so I’m not sure how it is going to fit. It looks pretty true to size. However, the red isn’t red. It’s more of a pink color. The fabric feels a little cheap.
NEG 	Attractive, nice glaze, handle has a most convenient little bump on it that makes gripping very secure when it’s full.
NEG 	The stiffer material makes it harder to store food in. My kids like the little animated fruits and veggies on them. I would try another product of different material next time.
NEG 	Everyday Casual wear...
NEG 	Very nice, color vibrant, easy to stuff with large old down blanket and towels
NEG 	Length of shirt was not what I expected other than that everything fit great.
NEG 	They dont last long but they are cheap and work very well. Dont submerge in water bc it may stop working.
NEG 	my sister has bees. I gave it to her as a gift
NEG 	Great gloves all around except lost star because the grip on the fingertips wore down fairly quickly
NEG 	this pillow works out for what its worth
NEG 	The Peppermint & Lavender are my favorite. Separately or blended together are great! The Joy blend is ok...very light for the diffuser. The Rose scent is interesting, still figuring out how to use it...overall a good set to have on hand...I do love this brand of oils, most have worked great!
NEG 	nothing to say they are new and worked for my grill
NEG 	This watch has a larger face than I expected, but otherwise, as described - great look, good feel, and accurate time keeping
NEG 	After broken in fit perfect
NEG 	Solidly made. Tough.
NEG 	Nice, but too many. My friends loved them and they really topped off my luau. V festive. Boyfriend says: "These shed EVERYWHERE! And you wouldn't let me throw them away!"
NEG 	These work, definitely cut down on how many horse flies are terrorizing us at the pool. Keep in ind their instructions, have it somewhat away from the main area, as they STINK. They're supposed to (supposed ot smell like decomposing animal - lovely I know but we're talking flies here). Downwind if possible. BUT... regardless, it does work (there are still a couple of horse flies here and there but not to the extent there had been)
NEG 	Great ornaments for someone who likes woodland creatures or owls. Bought for sis in law and she really liked them. Giving it four stars only because they are a bit cheap looking. They are plastic and shatterproof. Product was as described and arrived on time.
NEG 	I finally got rid of the mice in my warehouse with this ultrasonic item. Great
NEG 	Got these to Make bath fizzies and they worked great! The only downside is that the little tab that’s used to open it back up after you have closed it breaks easily. 3 of them snapped right off.
NEG 	Doesn't cover the other outlet and looks good. I wish the plastic lip on top covered the cord but it hides it well enough.
NEG 	This item quality is really good for the low cost. I purchased it, wrongly thinking it included a screen protector. I went ahead and installed a screen protector separately and kept this case because I still considered it good value for the money. The kickstand seems decent. It seems like a sturdy case that will greatly protect.
NEG 	Plastic pcv but it serves its purpose. Good to have ..
NEG 	great cup, ALMOST the same as the OEM cups that came with, EXCEPT no fill lines :(
NEG 	What I liked most about these eyelashes is that they looked good on me I didn’t have a problem with them
NEG 	First time purchasing hardside luggage. Plan to purchase additional suitcases for the family. Very easy to overfill; therefore must be careful in not overloading when packing.
NEG 	I love the feel of the fabric. This is more comfortable than the CK underwear I had a couple years ago. The pouch is a little confusing so a usage diagram would be nice, but comfort is key for me with underwear and these are amazingly comfortable. I wish there was a photo of the cut on the ordering page as the legs were a little longer than I’m used to but they aren’t too long for me. Overall I love them. Included photos are inside of the undies, the fly, and the front laid flat
NEG 	This medieval novel was action packed with a of twists. Stealing a bride to avenge the death of his wife I would definitely recommend
NEG 	I have 3 pair of these socks. I wear them when exercising 3 times a week at the gym + any long distance walking. I have ankle injuries that I've done PT for, which has increased my range of motion and strength, but not reduced swelling from trauma. These help immensely as I need the compression. They stay up mostly and moisture wick nicely. Often I can wear them more than once before I need to wash them.
NEG 	Band fits and looks nice! Worth the money.
NEG 	Hair is really soft and pretty, but I'm not a fan of the closure. Like others have stated, there are a lot of tiny short hairs in the closure that stick up. The closure hair also doesn't lay flat, flat ironing doesn't help.
NEG 	I just looked at this suggestion to review my kindle cover and realize I didn't get the color I ordered. Instead of punch red i received a greyish-black. I was surprised i had ordered such a drab color. As to the cover itself it is durable, fits well, and lightweight.
NEG 	Looks nice, sounds okay. Just a little something to add to the Easter basket.
NEG 	At first the taste was a little off-putting but that was offset by the benefit of ingesting a combo mix of salt and sugar substitute. I wouldn't recommending overdoing it, but once every 45 minutes depending on your need might be good. It kept me from bonking but I supplemented it with a lite electrolyte drink and water as well as some stingers.
NEG 	So far so good, plastic could be stronger, we’ll see how it holds up.
NEG 	I'm not sure they are the best wipers.
NEG 	I like the jacket, but got a bright red color when I ordered maroon/burgundy. (If i got the right color would have been 5 star review)
NEG 	Well, I really LOVED everything I got in the kit. Managed to get half a gallon of Kombucha from the Scoby #1 that came with the kit - (after 20 days). Set everything up for 2nd brew and had mold after 3 days. (Big Sigh). Threw Scoby #1 & #2 out, along with tea, per instructions from friends that brew all the time. Although I’m pretty sure that was an operator error on my part because I’m a beginner, I’m pretty bummed that everyone keeps talking about how easy it is to do - but apparently not for a Moron like me. Can’t decide if I should order another one or just drink off of my friends for life. Haha!
NEG 	Still like Lynn Raye Harris versions of Hot better! This book was Good, but not quite as exciting for me!
NEG 	Fits perfectly, but broke in less than a year. I guess it's an ok product for the price.
NEG 	There's a thick dry film in the top of the paste inside the jar almost as if the container doesn't properly seal it. You have to break apart or peel the film to get to the usable paste. Otherwise, pretty good stuff
NEG 	Easy to use Connection is easy and long range Noise cancellation is not that good
NEG 	Easy to put up and works as advertised
NEG 	Received my CenterPoint Sniper 370 yesterday. The sling was missing from the box, but I probably would never have used it anyway. It took about 10 shots to get it sighted in on bullseye at 10 yards. After that BINGO! It put three bolts within ½ of each other, dead on bullseye. Many reviewers complained of creepy trigger pull, but mine is crisp and release is smooth. VERY pleases with the 370 so far. About three weeks until bow season opens in Louisiana, so I have time to practice at longer ranges. The only reason I don't rate it at five stars is because the sling was missing from the box.
NEG 	I have a 2010 Rav4 which is a smaller SUV and I had to push the headrests all the way down to get them to fit (barely!) and really stretched them to their limit... I am not sure how long they will last. Also, There should be two more straps with plastic holder that holds the area where the bottom and back of the seat meets
NEG 	This is a very good quality corded headset that could be used for any laptop, desktop, TV or any other audio devices. Yes, it has mute feature and voice control. It offers a great sound quality at its price point. It gives you the private entertainment of ear-pleasing sound without disturbing others or you from surrounding noise. Its noise-canceling feature is very good. Earmuffs are soft and comfortable for extended use. It doesn’t require a battery, just plug and play. It also comes with a beautiful hard case to store and carry around with your laptop. It is foldable, lightweight & compact and it as a decent sound quality which could be adjusted with noise control on the computer. I find that the switch and volume control could be better. I find them a good value.
NEG 	The taste is not ideal. It is not disgusting but it is not very good. I do see an improvement in my supply when I drink this.
NEG 	First time I am using this. I ordered this to use with thigh high support stockings to make sure they stayed up, so far its good. I really had never seen this product or was aware it was available. THANKS
NEG 	I was reading some reviews on whether or not this works with Blue Yeti mic, and even the description says it doesn't, but I got it anyway because my friends who own this say it's fine. I wasn't expecting much when I made my purchase, but turns out it's actually not that bad; the arm is lightweight but it gets sturdy after you mount it. I did have to tighten the screw at the top with a small wrench to hold the Yeti in position (right now I have it up diagonally). I haven't noticed any drooping but it's only been couple days and I've been moving it around, but overall I'm satisfied with this arm for the Yeti mic!
NEG 	Good Sound. I like that it has AM FM radio. It's a good size for taking along with you. I bought it for a Christmas present, I think they're going to love it.
NEG 	Great tv in the upper mid range io quality
NEG 	I use these to clean my eye-glasses, and these work well, very clean with no marks, and the package is convenient for everyday use or travel. But there is a very strong alcohol smell when you open up the individual pack. Since almost all our glasses are made by some kind of poly-carbonate material, and so I am not so sure if that is safe for a long term usage for cleaning poly-carbonate lenses with the coatings....
NEG 	The quality is not bad for the price. The top is fairly well constructed. The base is adequate. Not as easy to get the “on side” rotation as I was hoping for but it does work well with some practice
NEG 	My granddaughter loved this and it is very cute. The only problem is that it sheds all over! We put him in the dryer but he still continues to shed. Despite the shedding, she loves him.
NEG 	It’s a little too big for my loveseat but I do like the how soft the fabric is.
NEG 	The tumblers were great. They were a perfect size. The only problem I had was I ordered silver trim and received gold.
NEG 	The taste is really delicious. It takes care of my mouth plus it gives me pleasure every time I am taking this.
NEG 	I would of rated this product 5 star but because the vent visor logo fell off the bug guard when driving the vehicle I'm not going to, the logo should of been secured better to the guard !
NEG 	My son loves it, my only concern is the woman swimming doesn't seem to have a suit on if you look closely....
NEG 	Love, love this product but the spray bottle was empty as it all spilled out during shipping. Was super sad as the spray is what I use the most.
NEG 	I'm thrilled with this watch. It's beautiful, and fits my wrist perfectly. It isn't a Submariner, but it's got to be the best value in automatic dive watches available. Mine is getting +4 and -3 out of the box.
NEG 	Not the top of the line quality, but it functions for what I needed. If you are looking for something simple, reliable, and functions, this is the way to go. The lid isn't as heavy as I would like, and always needs a bit more effort to close it back down (after taking a straw out). Otherwise, it works and I will keep using it as long as it lasts.
NEG 	It does the job but it seems a little to long and when the hammer strikes the end of this fixture it puts pressure on the front of the lower receiver and if done to much will mare the finish. Maybe mine was cut wrong ?
NEG 	I wish there were more to the roll, but works great for protecting poster, needed to figure out how to apply with out too many air pockets
NEG 	This thing is pretty thick. The only way my boyfriend wanted to wear it was if he cut out the extra flap. Oops, next time I won't get Extra Capacity. Leather quality felt nice.
NEG 	I really like the way it looks. I kinda wish the flowers went all the way around. I wore it as a necklace too.
NEG 	Very trendy right now. Definitely worth the price. I love how the shoe has a little cushion to it & not super stiff like other shoes in this style. Color is great. They're a little wide & I have narrow feet. I'm not sure if sizing down is the answer but they're still very wearable. I'll probably order another color.
NEG 	Its pretty good but wish it was a little bit more wider
NEG 	I had no problems viewing this (my subtitles were shut off by default for some reason, and I had to fix that in the settings, which was easy). As someone who used to love but now can't sit through anything with gratuitous gore/violence, I found this to have just enough suspense and darkness to it. It's a tragic ghost story that was beautifully shot and well acted throughout.
NEG 	Very good product but could hace gotten it elsewhere for a lower price
NEG 	Likes: pretty dress and the ruffles really give it that look. The small amount of gathering in the mid section Iffy: the material is a little see through and definitely will have to wear black undergarments
NEG 	Works great looks great. Does make some noise but it was a great addition to my man's man cave.
NEG 	These overalls are super cute and comfy! However I was expecting for them to be a bit bigger and kinda hang off me instead of fitting perfectly.
NEG 	Really like this case for my iphone 11 pro. It holds my phone and all the essentials.
NEG 	The Instant Pot since this book makes it seem very easy to use and gives great recipes. For anyone just looking to get started, this is a great resource to have on hand.
NEG 	Hard type but very pretty my daughter loved it.
NEG 	Cute. It was cheap and came as expected.
NEG 	The length of the cable is good. Connectors between joints work ok. However, if the water pressure is high, it can disconnect the connectors. You can use ziptie to tighten these joints.
NEG 	bought as a gift. nice packaging.
NEG 	Just a touch wider than I had hoped. I am 5.5 and weigh about 140. The medium is a bit to wide at the bottom but a good longer length. It fits nice through the busy and shoulders.
NEG 	Fantastic jacket. Lightweight enough to wear in summer and surprisingly warm on chilly days. Better for a slimmer body - ive got a little bit of a belly and that keeps it from buttoning completely (the button clasps aren't super strong).
NEG 	Tree is beautiful and lights are the perfect brightness. Sadly, the first windy day the tree broke off of the base. Specifically, the metal tore above all of the 4 spot welds holding the lower tree's part's metal tube to the base. I solved the problem by creating a new base using 18" long 1/2" black iron pipe to push inside the tree's metal tube, then attached that to a 1/2" black iron pipe flange. This flange was then welded to 4 legs of 2" angle iron, each 15" long. The base is then held down with 2 sandbags.
NEG 	My son loved this, hence the 4 stars. Product is made cheap, but for the price, you get what you pay for
NEG 	Does all that is promised but doesn’t fit well in all car seats.
NEG 	This is a sturdy ball, however, the 55" is not good office seating. I am 5'2" and at my desk while sitting on the ball, my chin is just above my standard desk. Going back.
NEG 	Lightweight comfortable charging easily stay charged
NEG 	Grip is fairly good but the covers do not seem to be tightly glued to the bladder. It isn't really priced on the high end, so who cares about the minor covers issue. I can always buy a crazy glue and do what I need to do (if/when needed). A decent basketball overall.
NEG 	These waterproof underwear are still very good, that is, the pants are a bit high.
NEG 	product works great and got it quickly in the mail.
NEG 	I lived in Japan for many years and it translates well if you have had that experience.
NEG 	What a great colorful case that is heavy duty quality for a low price. The only downside to this case is that it is open in the front (no cover)
NEG 	It was a little wordy and mentions that mommy bought me a potty. This mommy is not dumping and cleaning a plastic commode!
NEG 	These are NOT ouchless if you have a heavy head of hair. They are better used for children versus adults.
NEG 	I installed them using a youtube video I found online. They work great, just would recommend instructions or a even a link referencing a "how-to" when sending to customers.
NEG 	The only reason i did not give 5 stars is that before i gave as gift did need to apply several coats of mineral oil to give it the lush look. i would buy again for myself!
NEG 	While doing early Christmas Shopping for my kids and my niece I came across this adorable musical set. Since my kids are 8 and 10 I was trying to find something that my niece could use for a few years so it wasn't wasteful but also they don't have a lot of space in their apartment so I was trying to keep that in mind. I really love how everything fits into the backpack so it saves space but also so she can take it on the go. With 17 instruments I don't have to worry she will be bored after a few minutes. The pictures showed the tambourine had a giraffe, a monkey and a lion on it which I really liked but the one I received was actually a picture of a bee or maybe a butterfly so I was slightly disappointed by that. Overall it's a cute set but I do feel it is slightly on the expensive side for the quality and what you actually get.
NEG 	It looks good and arrived as expected. Cannot tell if I feel or look any better yet because I just started using it. The jade looks and feels great. My only comment is the writing on the jade is a bit big but other than that it's all good.
NEG 	I've been very happy with these in the past but the last couple didn't fit as nicely.
NEG 	The product is exactly what I needed to cover my front and back of the phone, been using it for a week now and no scratches on the cover as well. Service was excellent!!
NEG 	Super sturdy, could probably defend yourself from a wild dog with this case. Would buy again for more chips if the stakes get high enough.
NEG 	Didn’t fit as expected. I tried it on my daughter and I was really flexible. However, it was too loose for her and it kept rolling up and coming off. If you have a larger head, this may be for you.
NEG 	Feels nice on your skin.
NEG 	my wife love it just the assembly sucks . overall is good.
NEG 	I bought this for my wife who travels a lot for work and over the years I have noticed her frustrations more and more with an old cosmetic bad she would used. Here’s her actual review of the product: This makeup bag has been a game changer! I travel a lot for work and this is so easy to grab and go. I do wish the band lengths were a little smaller but overall I’m able to easily organize all my makeup, roll it down to see everything, and roll it up to secure and put in my luggage. I’ve used it every trip since I got it. Love it!
NEG 	Great product - stuck on right away and the gel padding feels very comfortable. Would purchase again.
NEG 	These socks can be a bit too tight and leave mark if to wear all day, otherwise, nice socks.
NEG 	Nice little mirror but the tint was too dark for me makes it hard to see,returned for refund .
NEG 	Definitely small, but it fits the essentials and that is what I wanted.
NEG 	The instructions in the package was out of date and incorrect (i.e. mentioned that side A had four holes total on one end when it was only three which confused me as to whether or not I had the wrong side... and Step 2 was a copy and paste image of Step 3 so it was unclear what goes where). Other than that, great product, super sturdy and would definitely recommend!
NEG 	Love having these little cheat sheets with me during clinical. I told all my classmates about this and now I see everyone walking around with them.
NEG 	So comfy, bought it for myself Andy kids ke stealing it
NEG 	I bought it to mod. Good specs for a cheap watch. No complaints.
NEG 	A little awkward for what I am using them for...I DJ and use them to cue music...they are little uncomfortable because the cups turn and can be awkward when I am trying to cue quickly but overall good sound
NEG 	Mirrors are so clear, and the design is pretty well thought-out. However, there were no pre-drilled holes as described in the instruction sheet, making it rather more difficult than necessary to attach the hangars. I have to assume it was a one-off problem, and ultimately I'm pretty happy with how the mirrors look! There seem to be magnets of something holding the mirror shut when closed. I feel like there should be some visual cue as to which side the mirror opens from, and closes from. When you're opening the mirror, it's a guessing game (is it the magnet holding it shut and I should pull harder, or am I pulling on the wrong side?), and when you're closing the wings, if you guess wrong you put strain on the hinges because they hit the frame.
NEG 	These phone rings were really cheap for the quality of the product, and are a super cute addition to your phone, but my only problem is that the adhesive isn't very strong. It sticks to my phone and stays, but is very easy to peel off, and just feels like it'll fall off at any second.
NEG 	This is a gorgeous band, but a little difficult to put on due to the magnet closure constantly sticking as you try to adjust the band. The photo is with my rose gold 3rd gen Apple Watch for color comparison. The band is very adjustable and my go to design due to having a very small wrist that’s often too small for other Apple Watch bands to fit.
NEG 	I am disappointed in my clay for it looks and smells as if covered in mold. Emailed the company and the responded quickly with new clay on the way.
NEG 	The light output is good. The 9006 lights are loose on their base and the 9005 bulbs had to be ground down to fit my headlight housings because they are too big. However, for the price I am happy and they seem to work well.
NEG 	I have used it twice a day since I received it. I think it is helping.
NEG 	i used these for listening to podcasts and music at my job. battery would last for multiple days and sound quality was pretty good for the price. however, after owning them for 6 months one ear bud stopped working. i still had use of all the features after the war bud stopped working though. overall, i’m not upset about it for what i paid for them and i wasn’t exactly gentle with them either.
NEG 	Have not watched it yet.
NEG 	Good for everyday web browsing or social media. Not so much for Games or Movies. For the price not bad considering. Thank you Philip G Scott
NEG 	I like the feeling of this case, it doesnt protect the edges of the phone very well.
NEG 	Tom is always a good read but his books just go on and one and on......... Plausible story line especially in light of today's news.
NEG 	Its says espresso but it actually has more of a burgundy to it then a dark brown??. but still nice!
NEG 	I love this tripod. I havent used it yet, but it looks like its a quality product. So the tripod comes with many attachments. I purchased it to record self videos and with it i can use my phone, tablet, and camera to do that. I also got it to watch netflix or other streams by just propping it near the bed. I opened it up, checked all features including bluetooth, which connects quickly, seems worth the money. Its not as tall if u dont use the portion that bends, but besides that, its nice. I would buy it again.
NEG 	Works well for the table but just wasnt impressed with the duller color.
NEG 	Seems to be of the normal quality of other exercise balls that I've had and around the same price point.
NEG 	they worked and look really great on my chairs, gave it 4 out of 5 since one of the 4 i ordered wa stained but im returning it and ordering another one. extremely easy to install and changes teh whole look of my little dining room set
NEG 	The phone is great, as advertised. The only thing I didn't like is that you need an adapter to connect the headphones, which I'm sure eventually will get loss. Other than that, the phone is amazing.
NEG 	The coloring is not as teal. It’s s very soft aqua/mint. Cute outfit. Well made. Soft
NEG 	With some fabrication I was able to mount this to my 1985 cj7 looks great and seems to be strong not as thick of a material as I would like but still seems strong
NEG 	This was a cute story and I enjoyed it very much.
NEG 	Really effective for keeping out the heat! We noticed an immediate difference after hanging it outside over our sliding door.
NEG 	Great bumper for my toddlers twin bed. Easy to place in the bed and remove when sheets needs to be removed and washed. My toddler kicks and moves allot but this bumper keeps my toddler in the bed all night.
NEG 	Probably not up to the professional quality of Stewmac luthier tools, but meet my DIY needs just fine.
NEG 	They were cute a bit smaller than I expected. My kiddo loves them.
NEG 	College ceased being a bastion of free speech and free exchange of ideas decades ago. Thanks to liberals.
NEG 	Zach is found with a head injury in a hiking path that Charlie was on. She nurses him back to health but he's missing the last few years of his life. She helps him cope with the memory lapse by taking him to a family cabin to rest and recover. It was never explained how he was injured and who did it. You wonder if it was his business partner and fiancee but are never told. She thinks that she loves her neighbor Kirk who is a doctor where she works. Zach falls quickly for Charlie but she needs to see Kirk's true character before she realizes that Zach has much more to offer her. It's cute, light, no bad guys making trouble for main characters. A quick read.
NEG 	Was expecting a much lesser quality item for the price but when it arrived in the mail I was impressed. It was also packaged very nicely so I did not find any scratches. The color is a nice white and it is true to size. Fits well in small places and is complimentary to other furniture. My only disappointment was that there was a decent sized ding on the bottom shelf that someone had put white out/cover on top of to hide. It's very small but I still noticed.
NEG 	This product didn't end up being right for me and when I returned it they gave me a FULL refund. The customer service was great! They helped me out a lot.
NEG 	These are thick and sturdy. They stay in place. I would like to have one more smaller band for even more resistance. These are good. I like them. They seem like they will last a long time.
NEG 	Great value for family and pets!
NEG 	Works great so far. Great color and texture. The only minor (minor) issue is this: the velcro strap that allows you to wrap the wire up and secure it doesn’t fit over the plugs, so instead of conveniently adhering to the wire at all times, even when not being utilized, it is unattached.
NEG 	I haven't had the unit long enough for a real review but so far the screen protector and the Spigen case are working well. The big question with screen protectors is do they stay securely to the glass and so far mine is. If it lasts over time I would give it a 5 star rating.
NEG 	Good but it takes practice
NEG 	Looks great and fit right.
NEG 	I can't seem to get it to put out full power but it works a hell of a lot better than the 80 amp stock alternator for my new stereo system.
NEG 	The only thing I would change is the size of the mesh filter which has a very small capacity. I have to fill it about three times and then it loses enough heat I have to nuke it because I add half and half. But, I really like this unit a lot.
NEG 	Very beautiful. The flocking is just lovely. The only problem is the screws in the tree stand do not seem to fit so our tree is a little wobbly if moved.
NEG 	Purchased as a Christmas gift for an avid 9 y/o reader, this book wasn't enthusiastically received. I suspect the prose poetry was off-putting. And yet, she may come around to it in time. I'm hoping.
NEG 	I would prefer an electronic light sensor adjustment, so I could custom set the light level it operates on, since it activates when its still light. Can't fault it otherwise, and certainly good value for money.
NEG 	This book was worth the read. It Seemed to drag a bit as it took forever for Breckenridge and Heather to get to their real feelings of love....
NEG 	It's been so long since I read this that I can't remember details about the normal things I mention in reviews. I only remember that I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It was fun to see a non-magical person thrive in a magical world, and everything flowed together. Diverse characters were the cherry on top.
NEG 	Love the flowers on the sandals. Wish they were better foot support. One of them were messed up when I got it but I fixed it because that's what wouldve been easiest in the long run.
NEG 	works good but need to inform people that it is a slide on blade replacement
NEG 	Great invention!! Super easy to use and they do hook up to target bags with no issue. My only problem with them is that they seem to unscrew while pumping. I had to keep retightening them
NEG 	This ordered because it was a required book for a college course that my daughter is taking. I never knew that Amazon sold used books. What a great idea. Prime pays for itself again.
NEG 	Very sturdy once assembled, but assembly requires a bit of muscle to get everything to line up properly.
NEG 	Item works very well. I have not had to use the shock button on either dog yet but light, beep and vibrate all work.
NEG 	It is flux, and it works. Could warrant 5 stars, but I am so green at soldering that I don't have a large bank of experience to compare it with other products.
NEG 	So far these are nice although I thought the blue would be more navy and it is much lighter. Colors should be corrected on line.
NEG 	Fly mask arrived in a timely manner. The "horse" size fits my large quartet horse well. My only complaint is that the ears are a couple of inches too long so they tend to flop and irritate him. Seems to be well-made. I would recommend this purchase.
NEG 	It wasn’t really hard to assemble
NEG 	Great quality for the price. They arrived pretty quickly and in great condition. They were wrapped very securely and kept separated from each other. They look very nice under light.
NEG 	Absolutely didn't work for me. But what an amazing company, they saw my review and actually refunded me. No questions asked. No return necessary.
NEG 	I didn't post a photo because I can't decide the best place to put these just yet, but I did test one on my wall and they are good quality, and removed without damaging my wall surface. The price was a few dollars lower than any craft store's. The cactus theme goes perfectly with my decor.
NEG 	Couldn't find a reasonable soft toy Armadillo in retail shops as a baby gift for a Texan baby so had to buy one online. Amazing to live in Texas and have to go out of state to get an Armadillo.
NEG 	This is a great addition to my Egyptian themed living room but wish there was some carvings on the handle
NEG 	This fan is just okay. It does it’s job as a fan and it’s a good price, but I feel that it is cheaply made. Mine arrived today and one or the side caps was already broken off. I purchased brand new, however, I may have gotten a slightly used one that broke upon assembly and was sent back without inspection. It doesn’t affect the motor or the blade, but it’s kind of an eye sore. Guess it’s time to pull out the super glue and suck it up.
NEG 	Overall, I'm very pleased. Excellent value for the cost. Easy setup, Exceptional video quality, I'm a bit disappointed with the audio clarity.
NEG 	my only concerned about this problem is that the hinges are on the top instead of on the side like a book it would be a whole lot easier for me to have it open from the side and I feel like the product would be more stable in terms of latching. Outside of that it's able to hold report sheets and has a nice place to hold a pen on the bottom which I store an emergency pen because in healthcare pens disappear just as fast as pain medication :)
NEG 	Wish it was filled more fully; the corners were not filled at all. I would have gotten a bigger insert if I'd known. But I can fill them in myself. They did come VERY qickly though and were not expensive.
NEG 	Beautiful little shoes, but the flower decorations fell off after wearing them once.
NEG 	The author does a real good job with the characters and how she describes them so perfectly. You can imagine being there with them as they are doing great one minute and sad the nest minute. Sorry that she had a miscarriage as bad as she wanted a baby but always hope for great things to happen in the future. A great read.
NEG 	Just what my swollen legs needed! Really helps relieve the swelling and ache in my legs.
NEG 	received as expected
NEG 	A good, solid sport watch. Easy to read display, uncomplicated, sturdy construction. The band is comfortable if a bit flimsy feeling but at this price it's hard to complain. I like it.
NEG 	Feels good but got kind of sticky after two or three uses. (Washes after every use an no lube was ised$ Also was slightly damaged when removing from a cloth harness. :(
NEG 	I ordered this chair because of my lower back pain that is aggravated by sitting. The chair is easy to assemble, adjustable, and comfortable. I'm still getting used to it, but I think it will work well for me.
NEG 	I ordered this when my daughter turned 6 months and it game with multiple dvds and flash cards for each set of dvds and books for the stories on the dvd. I will say at first I didn’t think it was all that but my daughter started trying to say the letters about 2 weeks into showing her the videos, I did slack some days. I can only imagine where she would be if I did it everyday . It’s proving useful so far
NEG 	Very cute and clean looking. It was easy to assemble but not as thick / sturdy as I would have hoped
NEG 	Lovely patterns. All are written patterns, no chart reading
NEG 	All the Wolf Mountain Peak books are good and this is no exception. It was very nice for Helena to finally get her own book and chance at happiness. I voluntarily reviewed an arc.
NEG 	Like that they are breathable.
NEG 	Not only functions as described but even better. Works better then similar more expensive products This is a quality, well made product that should be an addition to every older mans' collection . Keeps things happening. In addition to the better and stronger erection it increases sensitivity and overall enjoyment. Although the instructions suggest using for 10 minutes at a time, you need to work up to 10 minutes . Use lube as recommended.
NEG 	at least the objects were not super easy too find. addictive time waster but fun. some objects real small strained my old eyes.
NEG 	Works great. Filters low and high frequency as described.
NEG 	wow. Didn't expect this. Well done. Wish it had been more developed.
NEG 	A little larger than what I had expected but the elastic on the arm helps with that! Overall I think it’s an awesome product!
NEG 	works well, but I wish I could use them more than a couple times. They loose their flavor after a couple uses
NEG 	Even with the zipper back my heel slipped out. Was able to slip them off without unzipping. Other than being too big, great shoe. Im sure would be comfortable un the right size.
NEG 	Worked well but the XL was a little small for our large 100 lb. Lab.
NEG 	Good quality, easy to use
NEG 	Liked fit & finish but the adjustment stud was longer than original. Almost too long!! If I ever have to adjust i’ll Probably have to use vise grips. :-(
NEG 	Sweet fit. Great i don't have to take off belt to move it around.
NEG 	As advertised, good value.
NEG 	Smaller then I thought
NEG 	It was okay... didn't help my acne much
NEG 	I have a 70 pound GSD and he is way too big for this crate. The top of the crate bulges up when he stands and he cannot raise his head. This would probably be great for a smaller dog. The construction and materials look fine.
NEG 	Good bottle, trigger doesn’t feel as sturdy as the one from Sally’s but this does it.
NEG 	Nice color. Best for tan to deep skin tones. Very pigmented.
NEG 	They only sent 11 out of 12 brackets and the first package was lost. Being said they look beautiful fairly easy to put up just time consuming.
NEG 	Gorgeous and stays on because you don’t have to continually pull it up. Will snag very easily.
NEG 	I love my gel curing led light it has 3 different settings for curing time and it really works just like the salon!!!!!
NEG 	I just tried this glue it works well. Gets tacky quickly.
NEG 	Dust guards are very delicate & easy to tare or bend when installing. I think the price should be about $5 instead of almost $9.
NEG 	The insert is just cardboard and I ended up just taking it out. Hard to fit longer wrapping paper rolls in it, but it helps keep everything organized.
NEG 	I love Mam bottles. Baby took them with no problems. The nipple doesnt collapse causing you to take them out of the babies mouth. I gave 4 stars because they dont heat up well with bottle warmers due to the thickness and base of bottle.
NEG 	My one complaint with this (as long as it lasts a reasonable amount of time) is that the instructions are rather terrible. Aside from that I had a battery go bad a few months after ordering this and it got me to and from work with plenty more power for more jumps. I'll add it jumped a Cadillac DTS with a large completely dead battery (used boost) with no problem. I really didn't think this paperback sized device was going to jump my Caddy and was pleasantly surprised. Although I haven't used it for charging devices like phones I like that it has that option. Well worth the money to have one of these in every vehicle imo, sure beats jumper cables which btw aren't all that much cheaper anyways and require (likely) the kindness of a stranger or someone else to work, and take up more trunk space. I would buy again and recommend to a friend.
NEG 	Cover is cheap thin plastic
NEG 	This is a very cool jewelry box. It's smaller than what I have expected, but still have a lot of room for different jewelry items. the good thing about this jewelry box is its organized interior with a lot of option to put your jewelry and the double level box makes it possible to organize the items even better. I'm happy with the purchase.
NEG 	I do like the product. But it does have a somewhat annoying tick like other reviews say.
NEG 	The design is adorable! I've had this on my Kindle Paperwhite for about 6 months and it works very well. Very easy to hold the Kindle with it on. The only complaint I would have is the corner edge pieces have broken off with normal wear and tear (keeping in my purse every day). I'm not exactly climbing Mount Everest...
NEG 	What is the value for the price
NEG 	Good product I wish the chain was longer though
NEG 	one was missing a part so i return it. But i am ordering a new set.
NEG 	love everything about this pillow except the color--the beige had a pinkish hue to to it--not what i was going for--but it is very soft & the fur has movement & sways--just wish it had been a true beige color.
NEG 	These signs worked great for our baby announcement. Great product
NEG 	Prompt delivery. Great condition. Correct size. I was hoping the top side would be just felted and softer. Otherwise a good pad for my oriental rug.
NEG 	Was good and easy to install.
NEG 	The Sage did not work as well but the Tea Tree works great on my eczema.
NEG 	I used this stand for my brother's wedding cake (three tiers with the biggest being 10 inches) and it was really great. I was at a loss of what to use a few days before the wedding and this really fit the bill. It's sturdy and feels expensive. The only drawback is that the one I received isn't perfectly level; one of the legs is slightly shorter than the others. It's not a dealbreaker.
NEG 	The game is addicting.
NEG 	At first unable to get code to download app to my email or phone number. Have contacted the company via email. Now corrected. The notebook itself is more attractive than a similar product I got a year ago. I like that pages can be removed and returned to the notebook. The company responded promptly to my email.. App working with Google drive now. I'm pleased!
NEG 	Works like a charm but especially in a small too the strong scent lingers for at least a week. It’s a fresh scent but also a constant reminder that your dog peed/vomited in that room not too long ago.
NEG 	I like the fact you can cut things that are up high without a ladder however be ready this thing ways a ton. i used a clip to keep the throttle down so I could manipulate this beast. It is tough to hold the throttle down and cut for long periods of time. If your not a body builder or if you are are elderly and weak i would not recommend.
NEG 	I used it along all four sides of medium and small rugs, along the outside edge, and across the middle. The rugs don’t move. Will they come up without floor damage (hard wood floor) ? I don’t know yet, and don’t plan to lift the rugs any time soon. My track star cat would flip and move the rugs every day, and I’m glad they now stay put.
NEG 	Nice , soft and comfortable . Size I got was just too large
NEG 	Worked great for 3.5 years. Then one of the heating bars, made of glass, fractured. Kind of a dramatic way to retire a toaster. Because it was one of the top bars, I almost didn’t even notice it. Pretty dangerous if you ask me. Before that, it worked great. Perfect for toasting and baking. Only downside was the dials need to be turned up all the way and then set to the desired time. Otherwise the timer might not turn off, which of course is a fire hazard. Now that I have to seek out a new one, I may or may not try this brand/model again. Still undecided.
NEG 	Very thin fabric but super soft. Wrinkled upon arrival but better after hanging a while. Nice color.
NEG 	We have a Dyson V10, which is a fantastic product. But this popped up as a lightning deal, so I bought it for a vacation cabin, thinking that if it stank, not much was ventured. Surprising performance. It only has one brush, so that has to do for both smooth surfaces and carpet. It performs almost as well as the Dyson on both, is lighter and easier to maneuver, and has a bit longer run time on a charge. It picks up pet hair quite well. It does tend to accumulate longer hair in the brush, compromising function, but this is fairly easy to remove. For the price, it's superb
NEG 	I looked for a long time for a counter-top container for compost, and this is the closest I found. It's far more attractive than the plastic ice cream buckets I've been using. My primary complaint is the size. Unless you're really generating compost in your kitchen, there's no way you'd fill this before it needs emptying for smell alone. A smaller bucket would take up less counter space as well. I always put an unbleached coffee filter in the bottom as it makes emptying into the outside compost much easier (nothing sticks to the bottom), but this bin is too large a diameter to fully cover with one. A smaller one would solve both problems. Other than size, it seems well made. Will update my review after I've used it a year.
NEG 	The top flap with the lock keeps the interior dry so people can drop of checks without me chasing them down to collect rents.
NEG 	Bought these basically for work, I do a lot of outside work so I need something comfortable to wear. The fit is awesome! Overall good product!
NEG 	The color in the picture was not the color we got
NEG 	Did’nt hold the puppy pad as well as i would have liked
NEG 	Honestly did not expect much because we all know how good the Iphone quality is as far as pictures go, but I thought adding this would just make it a little better like the length at which I can capture good pictures. I was really surprised to see that not only did it maintain the quality of the Iphone camera, but it also allowed me to zoom in quite a bit and capture some really nice pictures. If you are my friend you would know what a picture fanatic I am, and this product really brightened my day! Thank you guys.
NEG 	Very cute, feels durable. Sterling silver. I wish the infinity sign was a bit bigger though sizing down so it can fit on a smaller finger!
NEG 	I wear these shoes to work every day. They are very comfortable. I am 78 and have knee trouble, so I need something that fits well.
NEG 	I’m sure this is a great product for some mothers, but maybe I just don’t produce enough milk. I don’t have much supply, so it’s kind of useless to me. Too bad I had really high hopes for this.
NEG 	This unit works great.i love having a second USB port in the Explorer..
NEG 	Doesn't say where the product is made either on the bottle or the box.
NEG 	This products works well but it has an acquiring taste to it.
NEG 	This wig is fantastic! The perfect Ash blonde color I have been looking for, super thick and long.
NEG 	It is a good night vision for the price.if i go by you get what u pay for i believe this one is above better.hard to focus specially if u zoom in other then that once i got use to it i like it
NEG 	I really liked this book, good story line, certainly different from most other alien invasion books. BUT large sections of rambling, it may seem like important information to the author, but you'd have to be a scientist to get enough from it. Big words do not make you sound intelligent! Lots of words stuck in randomly all throughout the book that not average everyday words, some are even rarely used.
NEG 	It is true to the description. I ordered my normal size and it fit as expected.
NEG 	Great for organizing for cables. Good amount of pockets and straps to store things
NEG 	Good story. Characters are realistic and interesting. The plot has a lot of royalty stuff which can either be interesting or just TMI.
NEG 	As described...I wear size 6.5 but purchased 7. They fit fine but wish I had gotten a 6.5
NEG 	Took two people and two hours to assemble, but once completed is beautiful and a great value for the money.
NEG 	Well made, confidence inspiring case for iPhone X. I like that the case stick to magnets, however that also means you can't use induction charging without shifting the metal plate to the top/bottom of the case... and I'd wonder if that is safe over the medium/long term.
NEG 	Love this, I did think it was going to be a bit bigger (as in taller and wider) but still works great .
NEG 	So we ordered this after researching our options for about a month. We decided on this one due to the different age children we have. Pro: Lots of options on how to use it. 27 ways to be exact. Easy to clean fabric, fluids seem to slide right off and not stain. The bench seat is really nice for older children. Super large basket underneath Cons: Fairly long stroller, it does help to have the extra wheels to help with maneuvering. The wheels on the bag (attaches to the stand up board) is fairly load when strolling in sidewalks with cracks. It is very large folded up and you have to take the seats off (this makes it take up the entire truck area of our Ford Flex) Overall this is a great stroller for families with children that range in age. Stroller feels very sturdy and moves very easily just takes time to get used to the longer frame. We bought this from the Amazon Warehouse so we got a great deal on it so we can’t complain for the price we paid.
NEG 	Installed this set on my atv. Product comes in nice and neat packaging. The whole setup is plug and play with a relativly easy install as long as your patient with hiding the wires. App works great and the lights will come on the same color you turned them off. Led housing is stout material that i will enjoy torture testing in the mud! Only 4 stars because the wires are way to long for atv's and would be very difficult to cut and shorten. Had to ziptie lots of extra wire up out of the way.
NEG 	They are what I wanted for form/function but one of red style will not turn off
NEG 	Bigger than I expected but does the job. Even though my dog has mastered the bowl already, she is still eating at about 1/10 the pace she did before buying the bowl.
NEG 	Suction was good not great. I needed more
NEG 	Great product makes the Echo portable and we use it around our pool
NEG 	Because they left off a few oldies. BUT best singing group in the 70s.
NEG 	This book is well written and fun to read, although not terribly suspenseful or thrilling. The characters are well developed and likeable and the plot is good.
NEG 	Great quality and performance. They sound great and I find that I don’t need to turn the volume up very loud because of how well the isolation works. I even put them through the washer and dryer and they came out fine. My only issue is that after using them for about 20 minutes they start to hurt my ears and i have to remove them for a few. I’m not sure why this is but I guess it has something to do with how long the foam tips are... any solutions?
NEG 	Purchased as a gift. Fun patterns for the holidays. The socks are true to size. I would give 5 stars but the socks are not as thick as I expected.
NEG 	I totally love this pattern and the fit of the bottoms, they fit perfect and come up to the perfect height. BUT! Holy cow is the top SMALL!! I'm disappointed that I won't be able to wear it, because it's so cute. And when I mean small I mean totally ridiculously small in the cup area. I don't think they could cater to anyone outside of a C cup and a C cup might be too big of a fit too :( I ordered the 5x because I didn't want it super tight, like I said, bottoms fit great and comfy but the top is WAYYYY too small..... Bummer!
NEG 	Thin pages cause a bit of trouble when reading, but still would recommend.
NEG 	Great size for price
NEG 	The book read fast and easy but was hard to get through the blood and guts. This was more a horror story than a mystery. Too much violence for me.
NEG 	She feels it's tight in the crotch and she's not unusually long as regards her frame. She doesn't like how it cuts into her rear section. Good fabric, easy to get on and off.
NEG 	It was exactly what I ordered
NEG 	Its a lityle smaller then i thought i got it for my Nintendo switch
NEG 	I was initially very pleased with this product because of the flexibility in adjustments. Easy to install. My only issue with this product is that you could actually remove the angle mount from the wall with standard screwdrivers. Typically the only way you could remove a ring doorbell would be with the special screwdriver provided by ring.
NEG 	Kind of expensive for the product but It does work as advertised. Also a bit flimsy. You need to be careful with them. NOt fragile but definite not rugged
NEG 	Biotin. Labdoor.com rates this brand pretty high. If biotin is part of your daily supplements try this one.
NEG 	Protected well, although moisture did get in really easy. Mine however didn't last long, but it did it's job. Was wearing watch when arm got hit and screen protector shattered and not my watch face! Sadly it only lasted a month, but went down doing its job!
NEG 	Been using them for several months and they are light and you can hardly notice them in your ears. Have 2 now, one for both places.
NEG 	It recharged my iPhone SE twice on a single charge. When recharging the power bank, make sure you use the cord that came with the product.
NEG 	I like the boots only a little too big. Will have to wear extra thick socks.
NEG 	I like this box, when it's wired right a little light pops on to show you which fuse has blown.
NEG 	Great wireless head phones. I love the sound quality. I lost my other pair and these are very comparable.
NEG 	Use on my Porter Cable heat gun to concentrate the flow of air. Works great!
NEG 	This is an excellent dryer for long, dense hair. It will cut your drying time in half. However, if you have medium or fine hair the dryer seems too strong, it doesn't create the lift and volume you get with other dryers. But again, it's excellent for heavy hair.
NEG 	The headlights are great they really give good light the only problem is I had one that went out and it took forever for them to solve the problem I bought a new set and it got here before they send me the replacement one but they're really like the area good
NEG 	As well as could be expected for the price. Not the best, not the worst, just right. Pro: Bamboo Con: Not as sturdy as I would like. Can tip a little.
NEG 	This pillow allows your neck to stay firmly in place (no head bobbing!) and it is super soft, has no odor, and came nicely packaged. I gave it four stars because it was hard to figure out how actually get into the correct position despite step by step directions. The directions need a real life picture of the final position you are trying to get the pillow in.
NEG 	I broke my iphone screen after only weeks. After it got repaired I put this protection on and no problem. It still looks clear resolution.
NEG 	No additions. Just the stitching. Really cool. Like a great deal.
NEG 	It does what it is supposed to do.
NEG 	The item that I got from you guys broke after 1 month and it says AMC on AMC off AMC on AMC off it never stops
NEG 	I got this to use on a Stokke Tripp Trapp tray. This does suction with the extra base after wetting down the tray and area between the base and the bowl. However, if the base/bowl are dragged along the tray, they do lose suction. And my 8 month old was very interested in pulling at the tab on the base so only works with that facing away from him. Suction doesn’t last the whole meal so be prepared to press down again. Still, this lets me give yogurt and applesauce more easily with baby led weaning. The bowls and lids nest for easy storage. I almost returned these before I tried wetting things for more suction. These didn’t stick well to my wood table, and I wouldn’t wet that down so I wouldn’t use these on a wood grain.
NEG 	The color is very pretty. But it started chipping in 3 days. So a bit disappointed in that
NEG 	I love the fit of this top. It is super soft as well.
NEG 	I wish the bag had a little more padding to protect the light table but other than that everything seems to be in good order and I wish it came with a wall adapter it only comes with the cord
NEG 	Light hearted and romantic . Not realistic, but a great story. Easy characters to get to know. The books are great individual stories, but the three book set is a treat.
NEG 	Big sound from such a compact system. I'm pleased 😊
NEG 	good price waiting for it to be instock.
NEG 	Instructions are very thorough, and it comes with 2 of everything needed (which is rare). Application was very easy and honestly one of the best feeling protectors I've ever used. Feels like I'm using the actual screen. Only issue is keeping dust from sticking to the adhesive side of the protector before you can get it applied. Hard as I tried (removed, cleaned and reapplied 3 times), I couldn't get a 100% dust free application. However, it is bubble free adhesion like the listing states.
NEG 	Is very nice and comfortable.
NEG 	I like it but the formula is kinda hard to get out when your trying to make a bottle supper fast but other than that it's exaclty like the picture shows. spacesaver for travel.
NEG 	These fit the machine as described, came in good packaging no scratches, they only reason for a 4 star is the passenger side door was bent out slightly at the bottom, but still did the job. great product
NEG 	Good fit, a little low on the waist though. I usually wear the carpenter jeans but Carhartt is changing its product lines more for fashion then work gear. Straight leg is great and fits over the work boots. Plenty of room even with winter boots. Definitely buy another pair
NEG 	Not the most stylish but works well got intended purpose and has held up.
NEG 	This iPhone 11 wood grain case looks very classy and I really like the design of it overall. It was simple to place the phone in the case. It fits well. My only question now is how durable it will be both in time and when I drop it - I needed a case that protects the phone and this one claims to do that. Again, it's very nice looking case.
NEG 	was what i excepted nice
NEG 	Good quality, super small though. Could be my fault, maybe I over estimated the size of 5oz.
NEG 	These socks with treads fit well. My only issue is the placement of the non skid rubber bumps. They are placed primarily on the arch of the foot area. That area is the least used and caused the heel area to be more slippery. The toe area would have helped with crawling but was again slippery. They are very cute and the strap helps keep them on the feet.
NEG 	Quality of the glasses.
NEG 	I enjoy "adult" coloring. Definitely a good source for colors. The only draw back is the packaging. The pens fit into a thin plastic tray which is difficult for me to use due to arthritis in my hands
NEG 	Smells SO good, and really cleans my dogs' paws after the dirtiest of walks. Only fall back is that these go VERY quickly.
NEG 	nice hat keep my head and ear warm without worry about the wind
NEG 	A little unresponsive using touchscreen through the plastic and the Velcro has to be positioned “just right” to not poke into my arm. Other than that- works great and I’m very pleased!
NEG 	Exactly as expected, maybe better.
NEG 	Very nice fit the money.
NEG 	An Excellent Movie! Animation dated, but the storyline can live on forever. My daughter found this on Prime used to watch it, she said 100 times, so I know it was a lot. I watched it to remember, but I didn't. Still, the kid that lives forever in my heart enjoyed it and was so glad to have watched it, whether the first time or 100 times.
NEG 	haven't watched much of it yet. I watched it when it first came on tv
NEG 	I use in my truck for working on a laptop.
NEG 	If your consistent with it you’ll see the it helps if you work out too
NEG 	Works well with my portable saw...
NEG 	Used this item to remove acrylic, water-based paint from plastic models. It removed the paint very nicely (with some help from an old toothbrush) with only a quick 5-minute soak, and evaporated afterward making cleanup a breeze! It's great stuff for this purpose and the price isn't too bad for the amount you get. The only downside to this is it's a bit picky about stripping other types of paint, particularly if that paint has been sitting for a very long time (wouldn't work on 9+ year old paint).
NEG 	I like that the case looks just like the picture and it came in a very nice box. I feel that it is a little over priced but we’ll see how it holds up. Color is a tiny bit off but looks very similar to the real case. I don’t like that it have a chemical smell, I will let it air out for a few and hopefully it goes away.
NEG 	It looks awesome! It's just a bit small but that's to be expected considering the price.
NEG 	Now that we go everywhere with a cell phone in your pocket, we needed a small cell phone or key shelf in the restroom, and this is perfect, easy to install and easy to use.
NEG 	I like them also no reveiw 4 the workout thing cause im fat. :p
NEG 	Set looks great, seems like it will be fine, BUT the the front left hand slot for the Santoku knife was not cut big enough. Looked for a place online to contact the company, but could not easily access one, probably due to the fact item was sold by amazon. Did not want to pack up the entire set and send it back just for that, so my husband had to enlarge it. See pics
NEG 	Works great,bu I wish it could charge for longer hours.
NEG 	Grandson really enjoyed this gift plus there’s extra card stock to design your own shield
NEG 	Good product, it will do the job
NEG 	There is no real scent to this was, just a pink color. It did a very good job when I use it but for some reason it did not heat as quickly as many other wax beads I've tried in the past.
NEG 	I love that there is a pleasant smell and that it's gentle on the skin
NEG 	This blanket is made of the usual Carhartt duck material that they use in their bibs and their sherpa material on the other side. The duck material is very durable and will last through years of abuse, while the sherpa material is very comfortable. I got it for my dogs to use around the house and on camping trips and they seem to like it so far. It seems a little pricey for the size and I would love to see it come in larger sizes, but I knew what I was getting when I ordered it, because the dimensions are clearly listed. I will say, the duck material bleaches out pretty quickly if left in the sun (as learned from leaving my Carhartt bibs in my Jeep for a few weeks), so be aware of that.
NEG 	2 reasons for 4 star first is it's too white. That might sound silly but it's even whiter than the face plate it comes with it so white it's extremely noticeable. Second it's really loud it ticks like an old dang clock.
NEG 	Works good, I should have paid attention to the size, had to drill it out to fit my hose.
NEG 	The only thing I dislike is the mold seam. But what are you gonna do? If they were flawless, they’d be $250. They’re incredible for the cost. But two sets.
NEG 	Nice comfortable, inexpensive and sturdy shoe I purchased to work around the house in lieu of tennis shoes or boots. A bit low in front but that's more an issue of taste rather than function.
NEG 	Good book. Good character development. Somewhat gory. Shows a lot about the mess that our legal system is in. Not in the same author class as Lee Child and John Sandford but I would buy and read another of Trainer's books.
NEG 	I have an s5 replaced to s9 the value is worth the price well made and fuctional Good buy
NEG 	Really good book for beginners. Weight Watchers is a great dieting program that is going to help you to lose weight in a safe and effective way. It contains various delicious and super healthy recipes for everyday meal. Absolutely worth getting in your cookbook collection.
NEG 	I want to be comfortable when I come home and throw on some sweat pants. Too often they feel like leggings and are uncomfortable. These are perfect! Not too baggy, not too fitted. The size medium was just what I was looking for. The pants are a medium weight. I'm going to order another pair.
NEG 	I got the impression that they might stain, but then they washed up pretty well. We haven't used them a lot yet but she enjoyed cutting zucchini and with some assistance carrots.
NEG 	If you have a lot of make up or brushes, SKIP. It does not hold many brushes at all and I wish the shelves were a bit deeper/taller so I could fit certain things in easier. I do not want to talk bad about this product at all as it IS made pretty well and does exactly what it says it does, it just doesn't work 100% for me. I use it to hold my "daily" items I use and have a larger box for the rest. Like I said, it is great for light/new make up users.
NEG 	So it was “nice” for a week. I don’t know if my cats just went wild or what but that baby is looking rough. We have like 3-5 scratchers at any given time. Lots of items for the cats to play with and this thing just got SHREDDED. It could be a little more dense cardboard. It was good for the price however. I used hot glue to hold some of it together and it may get another 4 weeks. My cats love it and it’s cute.
NEG 	This was a very good series more than worth the .99 it cost. For those who like a good paranormal romance and mystery you will enjoy this book.
NEG 	The last 4 bags we have received have arrived ripped open in the box. If this continues I will buy locally
NEG 	Can’t complain about the earphones, love the fact you can replace the cord if it was to get damaged. That is smart. The padding on the headrest could have been better. Sound is nice! I tested this with my USB headset, this one wins it. The cons of these headphones are it makes my ears warms after 5 minutes of use. The cord it comes with it is short, but I have extensions. I did not buy this for the microphone, so I cannot tell you how good or bad it is. Is it worth the money? Yes. I go though headsets if there is no tomorrow and I was tired of paying top dollar for them. I have a standalone microphone, and now these headphones.
NEG 	It works I like that it auto shuts off.
NEG 	My husband is the coffee drinker and he really likes this blend the best.
NEG 	Not bad for the price. Was not too difficult to assemble.
NEG 	It is true that it pays itself. it matches my coffee shop's theme which is retro. It is bright even in broad daylight. You can only imagine its beauty at night time. Definitely worth it.
NEG 	I purchased this jacket in a small and it fit sort of tight. I then purchased a medium only to get shipped another small without a good and was told I would just have to reorder. Now that I try to reorder the medium is no longer available. Unhappy with the way Amazon went about my return of the wrong item. I loved the first jacket if only it was in the size that fit me.
NEG 	The installation of the weather-stripping is fairly straightforward. It takes a bit of strength but once you get the hang of it goes pretty well. I used the plastic screen installation tool. Getting the old weather-stripping out of the track is somewhat tedious, putting the new weather-stripping is "fun".
NEG 	I'm tentatively hopeful about my aerogarden. I've taken a chance on in spite of the poor reviews. I was impressed with the ease of set up. It has a timing function for the lights and a light that will let you know when it's time to feed the plants. I re-purposed two of the pods with seeds of my choosing, because I don't use a lot of dill or curly parsley. Fingers crossed any of the plants sprout! Expect an updated review if I can get anything to grow.
NEG 	Nice little lights for craft projects. Work well.
NEG 	So excited to get these. Love the grate in the bottom to allow circulation and the lids to keep things fresh. Looking forward to organizing our fridge with these.
NEG 	worked once the unit was configured. Much cheaper even with buying the tool to configure.
NEG 	Really nice magnetic calendar. It looks great on the fridge and I love the layout. The way the calendar was packaged, however, left dents at the top where the markers were pressing.
NEG 	As a 11 year old youngster I loved this book with its stunning pictures along with accurate drawings of the Wings of Fire dragon tribes, however some scenes of violence may be graphic for young readers like me such as dragons killed in gruesome ways. All in all, I did enjoy this graphic novel even though I don't particularly like graphic novels but I hope you like it too random reader. waffles
NEG 	I wish they were wider. I put two on the same side and have to set them at different levels to fill the gap.
NEG 	My dog tears things up so easily and even Kong cannot keep up with her. However, these last at least a week or two depending on her moods when she is playing.
NEG 	The top and bottom flex back easily, the rubber is a softer rubber than most 2 part cases like this. but other than that it is a great case, great color, have not dropped it but it seems as protective as similar style cases. and its griped which is good
NEG 	Liked the soft fabric. So far it hasn’t pilled like other shirts from other brands.
NEG 	Installation was a bit of a pain, but it seems like a good product.
NEG 	Good product has been a month and feel like it’s been helping! Ordered more.
NEG 	It holds everything together, but it gets tight as you add a few cards. I was hoping it would be a little slimmer. It's working, but might look for something else.
NEG 	The slots for files only really allow for one file folder, and I was hoping to have a wider slot for at least two file folders. It is great for those of us that have limited desk space for files, but if you need easy access to more than 5 thicker files, I would order more than one. Other than that it is perfect.
NEG 	Make sure you know that it's very tiny. The picture is very misleading. ....cute though. Mine was on the light orangy side. Not as orange as I thought it would be, but it is in the "orange" family..... Can be a nice gift.
NEG 	Honestly, you get what you pay for. Pan thickness is very thin... you can easily distort the shape... Edges are not rolled, like traditional pans, so be careful when handling! Box arrived (like other reviewers stated) damaged (and the outer box it shipped in was not). Ultimately they worked okay, so I will keep them. (It's not often I have a use for a sphere/hemisphere cake anyway). I will just have to be very careful about storage so they don't get misshapen!
NEG 	This wig is by far the best wig ive gotten that was curly ... The hair is pretty an very soft ... Doesnt tangle or mat up very little shedding no smell to nothing .... The issue I had was they did send a 16inch like I requested. They sent me a 10 inch curly maybe 12 inch ... It took to bleach and coloring very well OVER all the wig is a great wig if you like THAT curly hair .... I would buy this hair again
NEG 	Smaller than I thought but does the job I wanted it for. Cheap throw away towels for spills in the garage and a couple time use hand towel for the garage sink.
NEG 	I only wish it were taller, love the logo on both side, otherwise I would buy again.
NEG 	This works great and a much better price than name brand! I ended up buying a second one I liked it so much. So far has held up well for about a month. One if them occasionally decides it can't understand me (maybe once a week) but if I unit and plug back in it's fine.
NEG 	I really enjoyed this story. The simple investigation of murder by an unlikely pair is both interesting and fun to read.
NEG 	have bought in the past and will again.
NEG 	Arrived in good shape and installed quickly (with help from a more knowledgeable friend, a lot less stressful that way). Took about 10 minutes from opening the box Sound is much better than flat screen downward facing speakers. Sound not quite as good as I hoped, but I am hard of hearing so it might just be me. Also, have to fiddle with TV to get rid of some of the base (I hear treble better). I am happy with the purchase and would do it again.
NEG 	The case itself is super durable. I really like it a lot. The screen protector could fit the full screen though, instead of just the visible part. And the kickstand is basically garbage. It broke the first time I tried to use it. All that being said however, I would absolutely recommend the case on it's own. It's as good as any I've ever used.
NEG 	A little smaller than I expected, but it does a good job at thoroughly cleaning my brushes. Also makes the process go by faster.
NEG 	So I got the 2 pack, one size , tried on the navy- perfect fit lovely and now took out black once - small ! How are you guys packing it? 2 pack- same size please ! I will give the smaller one to my sister - too much hassle at this point , great buy for money and if you get lucky maybe you will get both pairs actual size you order
NEG 	Really nice clips. A little tricky to use outdoors on the clothesline as they are a little small and can twist and pop out of your fingers, especially if it is a cool day.
NEG 	The wallet is good but they can rebuild it in a better more effective way.
NEG 	Water drains quickly
NEG 	I bought this new in the summer of 2019, we'll see how it holds up. So far it seems to be doing juts fine. It carries my surface pro and other materials easily, could also fit a laptop if needed.
NEG 	I ordered wrong since, will need to return for 2T.
NEG 	Purchased this for a legally blind friend in her 90's. I wish the channel and volume buttons went down and up instead of left and right. She knows down and up, but cannot remember left means down and right means up. I would rate this 5 STARS except for the directional problem she is having. It would make more sense if the buttons were vertical instead of horizontal. Hope this makes sense.
NEG 	I liked this book a good deal. Takes a few pages to get into, but the story progresses nicely and I do like the universe and the characters. I recommend it.
NEG 	The magnet is perfect! Holds the ipad great no slipping. I bought one for mu husband.
NEG 	A bunch of leather scraps. I got a couple pretty good size pieces so lots of options to make things out of. This is chrome tan leather so keep that in mind, I didn't know the difference between chrome tan and veg tan when I bought them.
NEG 	Purchased as present for sister. She loved it! Good, solid umbrella, easy to open and close, very pretty.
NEG 	I am a small female and injured my knee earlier this year. I bought quite a few braces. This one fit better than most and i kept going back to it. I wish i could have gotten pink or white, tho- just my preference.
NEG 	Glad I waited until I was ready to absorb this. Like I said, heavy. Kind of satisfying in a twisted, long drawn-out way. Mistakes time with tone. But I want one of those shrooms. No- I'd take a hillside for future reference...
NEG 	A little clingy, but a nice shirt.
NEG 	Solid construction. Setup is not bad. It holds several fingerprints, but sometimes does not open on the first try. If you are looking for quick response, do not get a fingerprint vault.
NEG 	Packaging, instructions, finish, etc., are all good. Stream is fairly narrow.
NEG 	Wheels would be helpful
NEG 	Well made and does what it should.
NEG 	I like the range and ease of use. The sound quality is not the greatest, but overall provides good value. I do not recommend using if you are also using walkie-talkies near by as the interference is significant.
NEG 	Good size but item arrived chipped/broken. There were bits of glass inside the dish.
NEG 	Took a while to receive but it's a nice, big towel-like blanket. Good for the beach or meditating on.
NEG 	The story starts out slow but the back ground is needed to understand the gravity of the theft. The writing improves as the story evolves'
NEG 	All Black, fit great even with mods. Wish I didn't have to sand of the bottom bump to remove mods.
NEG 	Great product! Thick and smooth material.
NEG 	Great keyboard works as listed. Quick shipping. .
NEG 	Just received my 7 - 8 inch salt lamp. Arrived well packaged and in perfect condition. With the light on, it makes a nice accent piece day and night. Not sure if it's going to make me feel better and all that. Might end up being just a fad like pet rocks. But the light makes it look nice, and the dimmer works very well to adjust light level.
NEG 	I read through it once to understand the message. I plan to go back through it and put it in practice. So I can’t say that it worked for me yet but I can say it was an easy read and interesting.
NEG 	Boots are comfortable and nice!! They do smell like fake leather but for the price they are perfect
NEG 	I bought this as a gift so I can' t answer all your questions sorry
NEG 	This is a great game up to a point, sometimes a bit difficult.
NEG 	It had all the features I was looking for the only thing I didn't care for was the band but I would by the watch again
NEG 	this paint by number is wonderful! looks exactly like the photo.
NEG 	Having read book 1 in this series, it was fun to see more of and get to know Doug, and also to learn that the problem in book 1 got resolved. I am not usually drawn to books with paranormal happenings, but I found Mina's gift believable. (Not the cookie connection, however!) I did not read this book as a romance, but rather an explanation of Mina's and Bernie's lives. I like happy endings, so was satisfied.
NEG 	Really easy to install. I had a small problem with mine at first but customer service immediately sent me a replacement. Very good quality
NEG 	Cute little carriers. Perfect for my smaller birds, for vet visits and traveling.
NEG 	After replacing the new one, the air in my car become so much better. The only thing I don't like it the air flow is not as strong as I install before.
NEG 	They work just fine and are exactly what is advertised. This headset really amplifies my gaming experience.
NEG 	I wanted a smaller bottle BUT these will do for now I am sure I will use them,
NEG 	The book started off slow. But, it was a page turner none the less because I was curious to know what would happen when she went outside. I did not expect the ending that it had!
NEG 	So far look good I haven’t wore them yet but think they are going work
NEG 	Nice large strong case BUT thought would be in red for easy spotting in suitcase. It's black with red interior. Also thought there'd be pockets/compartments-is just a large headphone case with a small mesh "packet." Eh.
NEG 	I love the outdoors / chocolatey smell that this has. Thankfully this is light and not over powering. It is very hard to find this product locally and I was surprised to find that I could order it here.
NEG 	This is wonderful for playing in the evening. If left outside it loses air frequently.
NEG 	Living in Japan for 8 years, now that I'm back in the states made me miss that nightlife with hostess girls, and I was always fascinated with the Yakuza underworld and the family affected.
NEG 	I really like this Light! My daughter has it hanging from the ceiling in the corner of her room and it looks awesome! I couldn’t figure out the music part so that why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5
NEG 	Although the story adds little to our store of knowledge about the Middle Ages and few surprises, it is an entertaining tale.
NEG 	Could be a little wider but fits well enough.
NEG 	This author is one I know I can count on for a great read. This book is no exception. Miranda Montgomery has loved Dexter Kendrick since her family took him in when they were young. He's her brother's best friend and she's sure he doesn't know she exists. Dexter comes from an abusive family background and lives in fear he will become like his father. He believes he doesn't deserve Miranda, in spite of the strong attraction. He also knows her brother's will kill him if he makes any moves toward her, and especially if he hurts her. So he keeps his distance, maintaining a tight control on his emotions, until Miranda is attacked.
NEG 	This app is perfect for those who want to create a professional looking resume in half the time. Although the templates are a bit dull, you can still create a great, professional style resume absolutely free.
NEG 	I love tht it is waterproof but I would have loved it more if it had some side pockets to put smaller items in.
NEG 	It is a great game and fun for the family. I wish it had more common songs.
NEG 	Camps down hard so may damage your book during use, but as long as you don’t mind that it works great.
NEG 	I liked the feel of it on my skin - not greasy--but don't forget to shake the bottle or the mineral oil does separate--so this is why i gave it only 4 stars.
NEG 	Ok. Sturdy. Fits well.
NEG 	Holds all of his arrows and he loves it
NEG 	The remind me of the caramels we would get long ago in my childhood. They were fresh with a long range expiration.
NEG 	Got this as a present for my mom. She says its a little cumbersome as it is big compared to a regular wine opener but she likes it!
NEG 	This is my 2nd one and I love it for the price. All it could use is a strap on this or the holding case. I don't wear a belt all the time so the belt style loop on the carrying case is not practical.
NEG 	Nice Scissors but they were huge and thirty with scuffs marks as if they were laying around the floor. Not happy about that.
NEG 	This is much prettier in person with a mix of gold and pearls, white and off-white. The problem with this is it’s topsy-turvy. We had to cut part of the stand portion because it would just tip over on the top of our tree. With that being said we were able to cut and adjust and make it work .
NEG 	The only issue I really have with this pasta maker is that the part anchoring it to a counter is very small. I can’t attach it to my counter, so I either have to use the table outside of the kitchen and go back and forth or try to hold it down with one hand and crank with the other. Annoying but not terrible. The pasta turned out fantastic and the kids loved using it. A great addition to the kitchen gadgets.
NEG 	Original pad is thicker but these are a good substitute just not as thick.
NEG 	Arrived on time. Great for adding to slime!
NEG 	1) order a few colors you think may work for you and see in person which matches. 2) use dry shampoo if you find it too shiny. 3) use thinning scissors if you find it too heavy. It looks very pretty and is totally worth the price.
NEG 	Works and looks good as expected.
NEG 	Awesome, arrived early. Great watering system for my sons 4H project.
NEG 	This puppy is adorable, perfect for my two year old. We love how it is soft and simple. Super cute!
NEG 	Good details about the Alamo . Some good information about the Alamo. But lacking information in other battles for Texas independence .
NEG 	So, occasionally I find a crack/check mark in a piece of wood that would be expensive to just cut out or discard. Drilling into the crack and injecting glue is often a good option.
NEG 	Very nice. It was a little tricky as it didn't come with instructions but I looked at pictures and figured it out. I, too, added more stones as I didn't get many stones with the purchase. However, I purchased some stones at the dollar store and they work great. I am experimenting with different amounts of water as I like the sound of the water trickle.
NEG 	Nice book. Bought 4. A little religious, so I am not comfortable to give as gifts as I had hoped. Beautifully illustrated.
NEG 	Initially really enjoyed the game but too repetitive in battles with human/vampire foes. Quit about 3/4's of the way through. did like the concept of the game.
NEG 	Leaks a little bit great overall
NEG 	only worked for a couple of weeks but found there was a screw that came loose works so far great
NEG 	Great lightweight sun shade that doesn't take up much space. Easy enough to fold with some practice.
NEG 	i like it but i thought it would be thicker, fit a little too exact.
NEG 	The honing rod is great. As a cook in a hotel kitchen, I would recommend this for professional or home use. Because this one is such a fine grit, i would suggest possibly a diamond rod or a coarse ceramic as well.
NEG 	Not bad. Beans are better than grounds if you have the tool to grind it.
NEG 	Product as described.
NEG 	Like everything about this product--especially that is is not greasy and doesn't get in your eyes like other kinds of sunscreen. I only wish it came in a little bigger size.
NEG 	But very cute pattern
NEG 	Easy to hang on door and durable. Perfect for shoes and heels. My only complain is that I wish it had more room for bigger shoes like boots. Other than that I am satisfied with the purchase. Thanks.
NEG 	If you're looking for something to make mini-donuts that replicate the size and shape of Hostess mini-donuts (like I was), then this product will disappoint because they are about 1/2 the size of Hostess mini-donuts. However, I'm still giving this product 4 stars because it's excellent quality and would made a great mold for either homemade gummies or interesting ice cubes.
NEG 	Came as described, unfortunately these are much smaller than I thought, I read 1/2 liter...even though it’s clearly written 1/5 liter. Oops! They are adorable and would probably be a great size for jams or bruschetta. Pint jar in pic for comparison
NEG 	I love Wet brand brushes. They are gentle to the hair, wet or dry. They are sturdy but lightweight and feel good to my hand. And they come in many colors and designs. However this one in the pink flowers does not have an embossed "Wet" logo just beneath the brush area. All my others have it. In the pictures offered of this product, one shows it with an embossed "Wet" and another without. Also mine arrived with white nubs on the ends of the bristles, whereas one ad shows all black, while another shows white-tipped. My brush does say (in print, same as the pink flowers) "Wet brush" on its handle. I just want to make sure I purchased a legit "Wet" brand. Otherwise it seems like a good brush. I've had this particular one only a week, so I'm still trying it out. The way I clean and wash my Wet brushes is to pull out as much loose hair from them as I can with my hand. Then with a regular hair brush with soft bristles, I will brush it to remove the rest of the hairs, pulling them from the other brush. Or you could use a soft bristle scrub brush. Then I get both wet, put liquid soap on one and gently scrub the brushes together. That also brings up loose hair so you can grab and pull it out. Then I rinse both very well and dry upright on a wash rag. If you have thick curly hair or a lot of hair accumulated, you could try using the end of a rat tail comb down each row and pull up hairs before washing. Wet brushes seem to survive fairly hot tap water. Though I don't know I'd soak them in it. Likewise, I wouldn't put them in the dishwasher as some do. They might melt or the colors will fade away much faster than they normally would.
NEG 	These are so cute! We bought them for our Frenchie puppy and they’re perfect. I would give 5 stars for quality in use for a dog, but I downgraded the rating to four stars because they are definitely not breakaway and not safe for cats. We didn’t purchase them for a cat though, so we’re pleased!
NEG 	This is a nice quality pillow but a little to firm for us. I'm going to open it up and pull some stuffing out to make it work for us.
NEG 	Came exactly how described/pictured Pleased with quality of makeup for my tween daughter!
NEG 	My daughter loves Peppa. Unfortunately, this movie is just episodes from the show. I wouldn’t buy it if you watch a lot of Peppa Pig because you probably have seen most of it.
NEG 	Love the flags. However I received two of the same Labor day flags and no Memorial day flag.
NEG 	Christmas gift for grandson he loves you to read to him.
NEG 	I bought this for my spouse who works outdoors. He really needs a more rugged case for those times but he said he is enjoying the slim build while still having protection for the screen. He has dropped the phone a few times and the case has done a great job of protecting it. The front bumper attaches to the back of the case. He really isn't concerned about the color but the black and blue go nicely with the phone (which is blue). It fit nicely so all buttons and camera work properly.
NEG 	the customer service was wonderful. i ended up giving this to my mom who absolutly loves it. it made her happy.
NEG 	Installed it minutes ago. Easy installation. Opened an existing xlr file in a few seconds. Incredible!
NEG 	The credit card slots are very deep and I struggle to get the cards out. But overall the wallet is sturdy and nice
NEG 	They seem like good quality panties, but I had to return them because they're a bit too small for me. I cant really say they're smaller than they should be for their size, because in my experience, each brands' sizes are different.
NEG 	Works great when our pups are small. Our bigger pups would get excited and jump on the side and could knock it over. It is decent for the price.
NEG 	It fit perfectly and the quality was excellent
NEG 	I bought this when it was first released for $22 (since then the price has increased) and it is a great cat hammock at that price. I installed it as a centerpiece for my DIY cat tree and my boys seem to love it. One critique is that I wish the brackets were wider and used 4 mounting points each so I could then mount them under the wooden steps like a shelf vs. above. The current brackets are too weak to mount below and will cause wobbling. Overall pretty satisfied
NEG 	The physical remote eats batteries and keeps disconnecting from the fire tv box. Was really happy to have found this app as it is so easy to use
NEG 	Good quality Micro SD card. Purchased for a Nintendo Switch. Works as it should with plenty of storage space
NEG 	I like the product and the seller, but they ship with FedEx. FedEx decided to change my address on the package to a place I haven't lived in 7 years. An honest person called me and I was able to go pick it up. My correct address was on there. Still don't understand it. Never had a positive experience with FedEx. The only reason I will not buy from the company again.
NEG 	Just ordered this morning around 11am and got it before 8pm today. But I did the same day delivery. But still was happy about my product and I’am going to definitely order one for my mom as well. So thank you for your awesome service.
NEG 	The tree is decent, except the only thing that is a pain is vacuuming up the fuzzies that come off after the cat scratches them off of the tree. And the top perch is a little too small, even for my 8 month old kitten. Other than that it's entertainment for him so I'm happy.
NEG 	I like the idea of having my k-cups in Easy access and out of the way. However, I've had some problems keeping the cups to stay up out of the way. The shelf doesn't stay up in place
NEG 	I am giving four stars because the print is not that bright as it shown in picture but it is not that expensive either so it works.
NEG 	I agree with many reviewers that this book is a recycled version of the first one. Plus, it's hard to explain time-travel to a 4-year-old. I much prefer the original story. However, my kids (ages 2 and 4) LOVE this book. They will pick it over the first one almost every time. They think the diapers and the "tacos love dragons" pages are hilarious. They also love the last page, although the pictures include multiple cultural references that they don't understand. So, who am I to question a book that my kids love so much?
NEG 	Overall I'm happy with these. I'm a software developer, and I use them 8 to 10 hours a day. The picture is sharp, the size is perfect, and I quickly adapted to the curve. Now that I'm used to the curve, I wouldn't want to work without it. My only complaint is the enormous power brick which cover adjacent outlets on my power strip. They probably could have come up with a better design for this. I ended purchasing a second power strip just for the monitors. Otherwise they're a great buy and I would purchase them again.
NEG 	I am very glad I purchased this WIFI extender it really boost the signal in my basement. The reason I gave 4 stars was my router drops signal here and there. So at the moment I unplug the extender until I use my game room in the basement. But the product works very well. Would love to get a second one for upstairs.
NEG 	Very comfortable brace, stays in place and great support. This thing is pretty awesome.
NEG 	These worked very well for storing large blankets.
NEG 	Works well, it does slowly deflate over an hour, so not good for long term stable propping. but for the short term adjustability it is really good.
NEG 	Great everything works not damaged. Worth the buy
NEG 	This feels more productive to use than manual toothbrushes. There are also many different settings so brushing is more catered to the user. I like it.
NEG 	Works well (keeps my dry in a rain storm), is well made and far sturdier than the cheap plastic ones.
NEG 	I have had these on my pillows for about 3 weeks, but have had to hand sew one where stitching did not hold up...they both look like they may need this done in other seams soon.
NEG 	i ordered a 9 wide and a 10 for my friend. i tried in both and did not feel a difference. not the most comfortable for wide feet.
NEG 	Good feel, great quality overall, only 2 buttons feel cheap
NEG 	I havent rec'd the the product yet. Only purchased the cable portion. It will be nice to keep my lil dog in her seat in the car. Im also hoping to use the cable to tether her to the shopping cart seat for extra safety (her safety).
NEG 	These are nice sheets, They washed well and didn't really look wrinkled after drying but they do wrinkle once used on the bed like most other sheets. Still a nice set they are soft and have a nice feel to them. They fit my foam mattress good without slipping off. Would recommend.
NEG 	Have been enjoying this game.
NEG 	Building new habits is one of the most challenging and most rewarding processes. I liked this way that what the author described here, all these are very effective techniques & easy to follow outlines. Read this guidebook right now to learn some easy, powerful strategies for changing your odd habits. Here you will get not only guides but also various essential tips, strategies, outlines, lessons and other related things. So dont leave without reading this such an amazing book.
NEG 	I like the design, very cute. I like that it is glass. I wish it held more water. Overall a great product.
NEG 	Works ok but I would suggest using a more heavy duty one.
NEG 	Fit great not too small and not too big
NEG 	It is slightly different color and texture than what I ordered. But it is good.
NEG 	Nice soft cotton. Love the design of the monster. Nice & colorful. Washes great. I docked a star because my son is only 7 months old & his head is too big already, which makes me think it's the towel. The head flap needs to be quite a bit bigger, because the teeth won't allow for any natural stretch with the cotton. Maybe mine was sewn small, can't say if it's a problem for every towel. It's not a deal breaker for us. It's cute & we will continue to use it.
NEG 	The stick is smooth and kinda slick, and the tip seems to be sanded and glows way more than the stick, so I sanded the whole stick the same way, and they seem to work better.
NEG 	Love them for work and driving when it is not that sunny outside or working inside around metal like I do.
NEG 	It did do a good job getting chlorine out of my hair after swimming but left my hair very dry. Washed dishes by hand well but left my skin dry even though I had diluted it (both for shampooing and dishes). I don’t usually have dry skin so I was surprised.
NEG 	It's really good to have have little things like theses at home... this product is the same has the picture and the price is just right
NEG 	Arrived quickly! Cute shirt for New Years Eve! I ordered the M in silver. Fit great although it is a tad bit short, but it will work. I am wearing underneath my leather jacket. Also the silver isn’t really shiny, it’s more of a matte but does have some sparkly to it. Overall I like it. :) For reference on the “M” size. I’m 5.5, weigh about 155 and a 34C.
NEG 	It arrived on time. It was properly packaged, and appears to be correct. I have not used one yet.
NEG 	Good bang for your buck !
NEG 	Ordered 2 more just like it and they were much bigger than this one. Had to send back
NEG 	I like this slim lightweight cover and it fits very well - kindle snaps right into place. The back folds and stands up so I can watch movies easily. The only negative is that it does not have the inner hand strap which I always use when reading so I may have to get another.
NEG 	These fit my Challenger's seats very well. Much easier to install than other covers I tried. The only bad thing is there is no opening for the seat release lever. It is still a chore getting the straps under the seat. For the driver's side had to raise the seat as high and as forward as it would go to reach underneath with all the motors and wires.
NEG 	This bridge stays in place fairly quickly well, very soft and seems very durable. My only complaint is wishing it was a bit wider as it can still slip in the crack as my husband and I have separate ergonomic adjustable beds. But overall, I'm very happy with this purchase
NEG 	Works well to hold 9 oz cups for the players on my soccer team.
NEG 	I love, love, love these shoes!!!. I read reviews before purchasing many online items and there were a lot of great reviews. So I dove in AND bought these little puppies and man I am so glad that I did. They are super-comfy and what I love best is the arch support. In the past, I've purchased shoes and my arches would really hurt after a long walk (4-5 miles daily). Nope not with these shoes. You will not be disappointed. Breathable and comfy, you can wear for daily casual wear with jeans or just for workouts and walks.
NEG 	No complaints except now after a few months of having it it gets really hot and whenever hit a bump it stops working and says error. Still good though.
NEG 	good product, took care of my problem
NEG 	The fabric and fit are nice but the pockets are a bit too bulky for me. Just my personal preference. If it didn't have pockets I would probably buy extras.
NEG 	The products are beautiful, the shipping was prompt, and their mission is fantastic. I love my new matt, block, and strap.
NEG 	I was looking for a backpack for my first semester in college after many years, and I honestly didn't know what to look for. I just know that I wanted a backpack that was cute and stylish, and under $20. This backpack is it! Its material is a slightly shiny, smooth texture and has many pockets and hidden compartments, including one for my laptop. The straps feel really comfy, and it fits all my books, pens, and notebooks. My only complaint is that the backpack doesn't sit up on the floor, but its not a deal breaker for me. I would recommend this backpack to anyone.
NEG 	First time user of cap/plugs and i was pleasantly surprised how well it helped for lap swimming. I bought this type of cap to get the over-ear coverage that other caps do not provide - find it rolls up a little as your neck is bending with your swimming (this could be my personal form being off though).
NEG 	My 9 year old grand had fun with these on recent road trip
NEG 	Super cute used it for a dress up business affair got a lot of compliments good value for the money
NEG 	Shirts run a little large.
NEG 	I now own these in 4 different colors. I gave it 4 stars because on one of the shirts the stitching was a little loose but over all a good buy. They are long enough to wear with leggings and cover your back end. The colors are just like pics.
NEG 	Very nice, easy to set up. One drawer doesn't open very well though , there's is so much packaging , I filled 4 huge garbage bags of styrofoam
NEG 	Reading this book for the second time, because there are so many helpful nuggets of wisdom. Like a great cookbook, this book is a valuable reference to help you develop your design organization. There are actionable insights to guide design leaders in refining their design organization, team structure and operations. It breaks down core areas and you can hop around to different chapters and dive into topics that are most relevant to you. Glad that we are elevating this discussion as the value of design organizations, to design deeper human connection to products and services, will be the great differentiator in the competitive marketplace. Thank you Kristin and Peter for writing this book. This is a keeper!
NEG 	This is a great value. I bought this to use with my air fryer and it is perfect!
NEG 	good little saw but broke the blade cover off after 2nd using . company quickly replaced it for free.
NEG 	Doesn't shrink in wash with hang drying. No pilling or transfer of dye.
NEG 	This game is dope as hell and the difference in the available gameplay modes is a big relief when it comes to breaking up the levels and making the game feel much longer.
NEG 	Used it for the first time yesterday. I was very pleased that it went up about ten steps without any difficulty . Good product.
NEG 	Like the value and understand that is always remains where you purchase.
NEG 	Smells very good. My second time purchasing this cologne. Obviously just expensive as you are paying for the name Versace.
NEG 	I had one battery that went bad. Company promptly answered my concern and sent a replacement. I appreciate that very much as Quality is first but Customer Service can resolve minor issues.
NEG 	Convenient to be able to have multiple replacements on hand at a much more reasonable price. Water seems to taste as good when compared to the LG brand filters I used previously.
NEG 	They are great in conjunction with my bone conducting headset.
NEG 	Soft comfortable. We like cold sheets-percale hard to find! These come close!
NEG 	Edges of clip a little on the sharp side. Rough on the hand or finger if clipped to pocket or belt loop. Dress down with a Dremel. Otherwise, works like advertised.
NEG 	It works as advertised. I needed it for a small room addition and it works well.
NEG 	They look great!! I just slid the covers over my old pillows and zipped them up and now my living room has a whole new look and feel. I love the design and feel of the pillow covers
NEG 	This was a good product. I ordered it for Easter but it did not arrive on time. It was not the vendor's fault but rather the fault of the shipping company. The vendor accepted my return promptly and easily. I would definitely order from them again.
NEG 	I ordered it and requested the 2 day free delivery, but did not get it until the next week. No explaination for the delay was given.
NEG 	For the most part, these are fine. The first 2 on the top of the stack has small tears so I couldn’t use them. I wouldn’t say they rip easily so I’m not sure what happened to the shipment. The others all appear to be okay. The adhesive works well and seals properly. Bummed about losing 2.
NEG 	This is nice. I didn’t realize it was for four slice toasters though so it’s way too big for ours. Gave it to a friend and she loves it. She says it keeps the grease and dust away when she cooks and likes that it covers the whole toaster.
NEG 	Not quite as bright as I'd like but I do enjoy them
NEG 	Would have given 5 stars, but the nylon zipper keeps getting stuck and is difficult to get it past the waist band. Otherwise and excellent value.
NEG 	Works as expected. But they are hard to put on the buttons and then they can stretch too much and be ruined.
NEG 	I have not had problems so far
NEG 	Little lighter than i expected
NEG 	There are a lot of diffuser's out there, and at this price point it would be hard to beat...my wife wants another one for her office..
NEG 	I love, love, love these books. This was another great book by Hadena James. However, there was a bit of a problem with the editing. 5 stars once that issue is taken care of.
NEG 	Great quality, soft luxurious feel and great for making a room DARK!
NEG 	Not like the box matters as long as the items inside are there but the box was torn completely apart, other than that it is great!
NEG 	I wore this on a long run recently. The material is more clingy than I expected but it was a good fit overall. The color is highly visible at night which is what I was looking for. I am satisfied with my selection of this product.
NEG 	Won’t buy this brand again
NEG 	For a short story, this was very compelling. Held my attention from beginning to end. The characters are intriguing, interesting and insightful. At this moment in my life a great reminder that we do not walk alone!
NEG 	Very good quality and price. Very earthy, def unwashed. There was plant matter in the bag. I would def order again
NEG 	I give this to my Daugter , is was to small for me
NEG 	It’s not an absolute necessity but it’s nice to have. I like to go outside to walk 5-10 min with my 17 lbs baby without the ergobaby or a stroller. After a while, the five months old baby gets heavy so it’s nice to own this. I have a small waist but it fits nicely. The side position does not fill too well but I hope to figure that out. It takes up some space but for $22, you cannot go wrong.
NEG 	Good color selections. Wish the black elastic strap was neutral color instead of black. Overall it does the job and the color selections
NEG 	If you want to try ditching the cage to see how you like playing with a visor, this is perfect for that. afterwards you can get the better stuff.
NEG 	I am pleased with the product, but I expected a larger quantity .......... very small container about the size of a US Nickle, if used sparingly you can get 2-3 whole long nails out of this amount. So if you expect to do more you will require to have a few more in your supply.
NEG 	My son loves his backpack and that it glows in the dark.
NEG 	I love pocket decks in a tin, and this one really appeals. It is Thoth-based, but with added RWS imagery in the minors. I can't give it 5 stars because some of the cards have light horizontal streaks - a printing error. It's not perfect, but I'll enjoy reading with the deck even so.
NEG 	I love this and will buy it again. It smells so good. Don’t spray it directly on your clothes as the oil will stain.
NEG 	Needed some notepads for the fridge and liked this design. They hold well and tear easily. Only complaint is that it’ll take us like 6 years to go through 6 pads. Wish they sold them in a smaller bundle.
NEG 	The king size works pretty well. My partner just doesn’t roll them up her calves as the tops are too narrow for her.
NEG 	what size cotton refills does it take
NEG 	Just received this phone. Very big screen, easy set up. Pretty much like any other Android phone. It's very responsive and has not skipped a beat from my prior lg g5 phone which I sent back due to a warranty issue. I love the 64 GB storage as I'm tired of fighting my lg g5 for room on the phone. Also, the battery lasts forever. It takes decent pictures but I do need a little more time with the camera to write a complete review. Over all a very surprisingly decent product!
NEG 	I read Little Lies by Michelle Brown, in the Just Breathe Anthology. "Breathe, you can do this. You can make it without the release. Just breathe, you won't shatter without it." It's a short story about pressure and release. Daily pressure from family, friends and social media. Release. Seeking release in the form of control. Finding something that you feel you have control over, in a life that you can't control. It's too short for my liking, but I did like the story. It's very informative, and emotional.
NEG 	It's well made and I enjoy it, but really wish the card slot for a picture ID opened to the top and not to the middle. For as often as a person may have to get your license out, its a freakin' hassle! Otherwise, good product.
NEG 	I may have missed reading this, but be aware this product appears to contain a large proportion of sawdust, much like a very tough plastic wood. This is great if you need filler, but if you're mating finely matching parts, the bulk gets in the way. Instead use a traditional furniture epoxy. (Sears sold some of the best I've ever used.)
NEG 	Still highly entertaining, but this felt like a big placeholder and bridge from one story to the next. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if the next installment is set 20-50 years or more into the future on Safehold.
NEG 	This is a sturdy board book, with a fun storyline and beautiful illustrations. The picture quality could be a little better, but it's great for the price and ought to hold up even under my toddler's tough love.
NEG 	Great knife, I have had it fie a short time. The only complaint is with the keeper to hold it in the pocket, other than that I am pleased.
NEG 	Whilst I found the topic difficult to read, it was nonetheless immensely satisfying as I continued with the story. A must read.
NEG 	Looks good, shoots good, only complaint.... it’s all plastic, except for the barrel.
NEG 	the variety pack arrived repacked in other kind of KIND bars boxes but I did receive the assortment as advertised.
NEG 	Case is good and durable. Screen protector is junk. Its flimsy and terrible.
NEG 	For tea in a bag is good
NEG 	It looks great! The most outstanding feature is the choice of color which makes my bag stand apart from other garnet bags. This is a good addition to my quick travels when I need a few changes and allows me to carry my longer dresses without having to bunch them at the bottom of the garment bag.
NEG 	What can I say? They fit, they're comfortable, and only time will tell if they're durable, but by then they probably won't be made by the same manufacturer or they won't be available any more. Big business sucks.
NEG 	Works well for mid-cycle filter of oil for partial replacement of fry oil.
NEG 	I love this shirt, looks just as the pic, nice soft material, fits true to size. I would recommend this product
NEG 	Perfect little clover stamps about the size of a nickel
NEG 	Really nice bowls, but the size was surprising. They are quite small. Good quality though.
NEG 	Very cute with nice loves scenes. She could or should have been more prepared. Nice light reading. Didn't read the other stories.
NEG 	Smaller than what size she actually wears as in size number not quite right. Nice quality though
NEG 	nice looking unit well made but sound could be much better
NEG 	This is a great cup and feels sturdy in your hands. Only con is that the straw is a little flimsy and could be upgraded to just a little better straw. The wording is printed on the cup which is nice as well instead of a decal.
NEG 	Not very durable, but okay considering its price.
NEG 	All the warming beads? are on the bottom. Nothing on top. Works pretty ok
NEG 	The first part is very funny, and throughout there are sections. I got bored in some of the typical life stuff, that's because I'm old and have experienced them.
NEG 	I enjoy this series.
NEG 	Really cute hat, especially for that price. It fits a bit small for my average size head.
NEG 	Decent quality for what you pay, have since passed it on to a friend and is still working after the years.
NEG 	Most are just on the cusp of real horror, and a few are downright "huh?" material, but all are intriguing and completely literate. I intend to read more by Blair Daniels in novel form because some of the stories seem to be cut short to stay within the format, and think she may do better in an expanded form.
NEG 	Greasy didn't wash out completely
NEG 	Cute, smaller than I expected but will be good for feeding the grandbabies!
NEG 	It is perfect. Shipping was on time. No issues with it at all.
NEG 	I would Like this more if it didn’t sag off of my pack and play. But it does the job and is sturdy
NEG 	Another good read by isabelle peterson, I can't wait to check out the other stories, job well done.
NEG 	Beautiful, thin and protective, but it fell apart after less than 3 months. The silicon peeled off and it cracked on the sides and had to be replaced. UPDATE Torras reached out to replace the broken case, great service! Similar case to the Apple one, at a quarter of the price.
NEG 	Comfortable. Lightweight material.
NEG 	I love the concept and all the bright sparkly swirly colors This brand offers. But for me personally it was too clunky I'm used to more flexibility in the soul
NEG 	A little bit big, but very cute.
NEG 	Incredible world-building in this excellent novel crossing fantasy and the mundane. Wonderfully descriptive and imaginative, Nix easily leads the reader through the magic, history, and inhabitants of the world he has created. I'm definitely looking forward to reading other books in this series.
NEG 	This is my first read by Belle Brooks and I totally enjoyed this story. I don't like to post spoilers so I'll just say that Marcus' and Abigail's story has a lot of twists and turns, surprises, and nothing is as it seems. It also is a story of great love. This is part 1 and the way it ended had me screaming for more! Can't wait to read part 2!
NEG 	Storage capacity is great! Very well built, seems to be durable overall. The only problem was that it has missing one of the end cap bolt, so I had to go and buy one.
NEG 	Great knife for the money. As other reviews have noted, this is a bulky knife. Not something you’d want to carry in your pocket everyday. Blade is nice and solid/thick, and sharp, but the action is not as smooth or lightening fast as I was hoping it would be. Overall, solid everyday work knife for sure!
NEG 	This guide starts with the basics and will teach you everything you need to know including how to make an account and how to customize your avatar.
NEG 	Although I'm worried that the 2nd replacement b/t transmitter also died after using it for about 4 hours each evening for about a month, the replacement does work well to power b/t earphones with quality sound. Also pairs easily with the earphones. If it continues to function I will be satisfied. I must say that the SunValley /TaoTronics customer service is 1st rate!
NEG 	This is a beautiful purse but was, unfortunately, much too big for me. Would love it if it were smaller. Check the measurements before ordering.
NEG 	I liked the product, but after receiving it I realized it will not hold up outside so returned. Alto, the boxes came in broken with large holes.
NEG 	Its easily to view the scratches but it protect your phone good as my husband using it for almost a yr i guess its protect his phone from everything..
NEG 	Nice paints take way too long to dry.
NEG 	I started one week ago. I only take one pill, but I have to say I’m feeling weird but I’m a good way! I’m not fatigued during the day and I have spurts of feeling happy. So we’ll see
NEG 	In what is obviously designed to be the kickoff to a series, this is a fun, quick read. Characters are a bit cardboard, but when you want desert chases, tomb raiders and not to think too hard it's a great deck read.
NEG 	Works great. The battery doesnt last crazy long but it gets the job done. Overall works just as advertised.
NEG 	Good quality, easy to put on. A bit long.
NEG 	This is just what I needed. It arrived on time, without any damage, and very little set up required. I only gave it four stars because the chain and hardware that allows for the movement of the sewing machine height it’s self is a bit flimsy and my husband replaced some of it himself to be sure it holds up. It is exactly what I need, it isn’t taking up too much room, but has been a great purchase.
NEG 	Funny, material feels good - can't wait to see how it holds up in the wash but happy so far.
NEG 	Excellent product - very comfortable - suction cups come off after 2nd use.
NEG 	I thought they had a no slip back
NEG 	I bought this for by daughter’s first birthday party. We had a bunch of kids coming to it so we needed something to keep them engaged while the adults caught up with our stuff. It was really comfortable for the kids to use and they had great fun. But the bottles themselves had very less liquid and the last 1 cm of the liquid was not accessible by the retune. And the bottles lasted only like 5 minutes if you constantly kept blowing bubbles. It kept the kids engaged for around an hour. Luckily we had a lot of balloons which diverted the kids after a while. But overall it is a good party item and we also get refills.
NEG 	Love the idea. Just some pulps and stuff get stuck in the seams and hard to wash... would love a more detailed cleaning instruction !
NEG 	Works as expected. One star off as there is no cable management.
NEG 	Pretty good underwear little itchy tho. Have yet to see how they hold up washing and Drying
NEG 	I've been using these for quite awhile. It really cuts down on cat box odors when used daily.
NEG 	Kids are having fun realizing that there are toys that so not take batteries. Cheaply made but what I expected at this price
NEG 	I was expecting a heavier more well made piece of machinery. It seems cheap but has held up beautifully. Makes sandwiches perfectly every time(unless I am heavy on the PB and J). It kind of sucks to clean when there is too much PB.
NEG 	This is a slick little display that works just fine.
NEG 	Got here on time, great product but where I insert SIM card it’s broken as in where you use the SIM card opener a piece of it is missing other than that it’s a great product. Battery life could be a little better.
NEG 	installed in 2017 Jeep Wrangler. low beams are way brighter than factory. high beams only marginally brighter. worth the price.
NEG 	I've been taking one of these a day, with lunch, for several months. These seem to work well, but they don't solve my issues with gluten intolerance. The price through Subscribe and Save is comparable to buying from Costco.
NEG 	Worked fine in the XLR 100 video camera I needed to shoot video on. Decent amount of memory space.
NEG 	mic works just fine ,
NEG 	Very easy to stick to the wall. Almost like a magnet! Also had to take three off during the process to move them. Came off easy. And easily reused
NEG 	Basically a remake of 'Point Blank' with Lee Marvin
NEG 	Haven't installed them yet but they seem sturdy enough, no wobble on the wheel.
NEG 	I like to use as a night light
NEG 	Came in time very nice
NEG 	I originally bought one of these over a year ago when I lived in an apartment. Now I have a house and needed more. Bought the 3-pack. I did have to remove the 3 screws on the bottom and rotate the plug 180 degrees so it would work in my outlets. The first one I bought last year was the right way, but these were upside down. Mind you, I know that is because the old standard in the US was ground on bottom and the new standard is ground on top. I deducted one star because they should be able to update this design to accomodate a 180 degree rotation (or offer two versions), instead of me having to disassemble and rotate the plug myself. It is very simple to do, tho. Reversed all 3 of these in about 5 minutes. Anyway, I love these otherwise. They work as intended (I don't use the nightlight portion).
NEG 	Great item that I use to clean my hair once a week.
NEG 	Good quality. Really liked that the size of the track can be adjusted to fit a larger or smaller space depending on preference.
NEG 	Good .. It fits well. But feels little but mushier keys. Its good for protecting the keyboard from spills. But might decrease the typing experience.
NEG 	I've used this to speed up the time required to bring water to a boil for beer brewing on a gas burner. It will heat 5 gallons of water on it's own, but not to boiling in my tests.
NEG 	Really cool, sometimes you need go over a couple times
NEG 	As expected. I have purchased this item before.
NEG 	Would have been five stars, but there is an unsightly seam that runs down two sides of the glass, where I guess they were molded together. Otherwise a good buy.
NEG 	Most of the workouts are advanced. Not for beginners or apartments if people below you.
NEG 	Great fit and very comfortable.
NEG 	Fit well. Wiring diagram not included but written on small letters on the wires themselves ( wiah i saw that earlier:( ..? )on harness. Installation was fine, had to cut out back end of the old beetle radio slot to make new one fit. Overall happy with product!
NEG 	This is a very fun game!
NEG 	Use these in my bento, and they work just fine. I hand wash them since I don't trust itty bitty things in my dishwasher. The rectangles are really small. Haven't tried them for baking and probably won't, so I've no idea how well they'll work for that. Cute and I like the bright colors!
NEG 	For some reason I had a hard time finding something that will hold both electric toothbrush heads and waterpik heads. These days when both these products are so common in households, I'm surprised it's not easier to find. Luckily this product will hold both electric toothbrush heads(works on every brand of electric toothbrush I've had such as oral b and sonicare) as well as waterpik heads for both myself and my wife. It's very simplistic but could use either a tray underneath or mounting bracket if you want it mounted. This can be easily done with some 3M tape or using a small tray
NEG 	This is the 5th sleep mask that I have tried and it is the best at staying on for side / stomach sleepers. It still moves and will come off through the night sometimes but will usually make it to the morning. As far as the actual product, it is very soft. The velcro strap is wide enough that the mask keeps its shape and it is soft enough that makes it very comfortable on your head. I will add that it does not grab hair either, well at least mine not sure with someone that has long hair. The concave covering over the eyes is great. If you are on your back, you don't feel anything touching your eye. For the side sleeper, it is very flexible and soft that it is also comfortable when you got your face buried in the pillow. I didn't buy this for blackout feature of light but it does work pretty good. I did take a nap in the middle of the day last week and no light came through. The nose cut out helps with this compared to other masks. I purchased this to protect my right eye. I developed a lazy eye lid that opens on it's own when I sleep and being a side / stomach sleeper, this causes the sheets to scratch my eye and then for days I look like I have pink eye and it is scratchy and irritated. This mask has eliminated that problem and since I have been wearing it, my eye has been in great shape. I didn't give this review 4 stars because it still isn't "perfect" for side / stomach sleepers and honestly I don't think I will ever find one, but this one is the best I have tried so far.
NEG 	Like these a lot, great style. Took off a star because the frames hinges got loose really fast.
NEG 	This pump works well for water changes, but if you're trying to clean the gravel, it'll really only work for a larger tank. So much water gets sucked up but it does not have the suction power to pick up much of the muck! I have a 10 gallon tank, and was able to remove three gallons of water from my tank in roughly 10 minutes, including the time it took to put the pump together. It's easy to use and good quality, easy to clean, but would be more ideal for a larger tank!
NEG 	Really sturdy well constructed suitcase. What I liked least about the suitcase is that it was not the one shown in the photo, the black with the orange trim and wanted it to match the same orange and black suitcase but in the larger 25" version I had purchased at the same time.
NEG 	This product didn't work out for me, too ashy-grey due to my reddish undertones but all in all easy to apply and a brand I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.
NEG 	I like this chair a lot! I've got bulging discs in my neck and this chair allows me the opportunity to decompress my spine and neck and take the pressure off of the neck. The material is good, the stitching is good too.
NEG 	It was delivered on time and reached my expectations!!!
NEG 	I have been using the hard side holder for a few months but it became too cumbersome for the number of cards I have to carry. This one is easier and has more room for cash. And I haven't spilled cards all over the store floor since I got it.
NEG 	Super cute. Waist band is a bit funky but otherwise, my daughter loves it
NEG 	I bought two pairs of these. One as a gift the other for myself. The receiver of the gifted pair has used lock laces before so they liked. I had a more of an adjustment period of trying to figure out tight or lose to make them on my shoes and still be comfortable.
NEG 	I bought this just for me to have an electronic copy. I had given out paper version of this as gifts. It's a great book. It's a great read. It's a 40 day devotional journey...motivational and reflective...
NEG 	It cuts cardboard with ease. I bought it for my child that likes to create stuff with cardboard. He likes it. Even though it looks extremely big on his hands. He uses both hands to use it. But he is able to cut with ease.
NEG 	Product works and smells as it should. If I wanted a different scent I could have picked up for significantly cheaper at the store but I couldn't find this anywhere. The first package came completely broken but Amazon sent a replacement promptly.
NEG 	I recently started to learn macrame and when I saw this cradle I knew I had to have it! It is gorgeous and such a unique design. The light pillow type cushion that goes inside the cradle is a bit too flimsy, so I ordered a thicker one from England to add more support. For a newborn, this may be better, but as the baby grows more to 8-10 pounds, it looks like it will be necessary to put a wooden base in the bottom as well!
NEG 	I love to this turner which I looked for..rust free..and safety on cooking! Only small disappointing is a little heavier than I think.
NEG 	Sealable bag kept the product fresh. Tasted great when prepared.
NEG 	I like the built in runners for hanging files but the drawers do not fully extend. This makes it so you are unable to fill the drawer to capacity and still access your files.
NEG 	Very Cute!! I got this to send to my mom for Mother's day. it has a slip in the side blank card to write your message on, if you dont want to write by the 'vase'. My only wish - that it was a little bigger :) but it is really cute.
NEG 	One sensor was bad out of the box. That's the reason I've been unable to get the tpms system programmed.
NEG 	I liked that it felt well made.easy to use.
NEG 	Very pretty top. Material was nice and fit was good.
NEG 	I bought for my wife and she said its a nice color and material
NEG 	Great hold strength, fantastic scent and at a great price! Don Juan, is quickly becoming my go to for all my pomade needs.
NEG 	This bag works great for me! I've been looking for awhile for this style of bag! I can put my sweaty gym clothes in the bag close it and done! I can put back in my gym bag without having to worry about my clothes stinking up my bag! It seals the wetness and odors! This bags holds socks,underwear,shorts, and shirt with no problem! That's plenty for me you may need a bigger size if you want to pack your shoes and workout pants or sweatshirts! Its real easy to clean as well!
NEG 	The only complaint I have is that it doesn’t have the ability to operate the switch twice and go from motion sensor to on and then back to motion sensor again. Other than that, I’m very happy. Installed it on my second story back deck and it lights up my 1/4 acre yard when turned on.
NEG 	Love the smell. Unfortunately the smell disapates very quickly.
NEG 	The first disc was missing in Season One.
NEG 	Beautiful color and dress design. Love the fit and the length for hubby! A little on the thin side though.
NEG 	Since I wear a 101/2 and there are no half sizes after size 10 I had been advised to go for the smaller size because the slippers stretch out. I’m still hoping that happens since my toes hit the end of the toe. They are well-made and warm.
NEG 	I'm surprised how long the battery last very well
NEG 	Not hard to install but the covering material is very slick and you need to put a rug or other non-slip surface on top of it if you don't want you pet slipping around while seated on it.
NEG 	Just had this projector screen put in my new movie room and I loooove it. I thought it was too big at first but with some adjustments it looks and works great.
NEG 	Only giving four stars because the handle to push the stroller is a bit low. I’m 5’4 and it’s kinda low for me. It’s nice and big though and both my 17lb babies (dogs) fit it in very comfortable.
NEG 	Is not very sturdy and does not hold much weight.
NEG 	I finished this story in a couple of days due to a cold and the meds knocking me out. It has a HEA but it was an abrupt ending. They all went from being so miserable with her head shoved up her butt to Hugs and Kisses in public. It left me wanting at the end. Like Jodi didn't know what to do with it. It seemed like she missed somethings. I guess a more involved and deeper storyline. I don't know. But I will be giving her another go by reading another of her stories hopefully it's better and will leave me with a more lasting satisfaction.
NEG 	My dog seems to like this one. It's grain free, and not as expensive as some other brands.
NEG 	It is cute, and will be a natural and reuseable serving tray.
NEG 	It is what it is, it’s a cheap couch. Works fine- not the best quality for anyone who isn’t petite- it busted when my dad sat on it- he’s not a very large guy.
NEG 	I use this in my closet to hold accessories. The main frame of the unit is solid and easy to move where you need it, but I wouldn't put heavier items in the bins, as they are not made of the strongest material. The unit works well for my purpose and the price is great.
NEG 	Reasonable at my location
NEG 	Wouldn't recommend for a diabetic. My husband has thin legs and ankles and these socks were still too tight.
NEG 	The assortment was nice but the box was smaller than I expected for the price. Everything looks good, but I probably won't eat the spicy one. I bought it for a diabetic so the sugared ones will be eaten a little at a time. Very pretty package.
NEG 	I learned new ways to pray different prayers aimed to address specific areas of my life, relationships, and others. Will use this book for reference.
NEG 	This was given as a gift
NEG 	Works good reasonable price. Battery back up and wall plug in
NEG 	Its heavy duty. A little pricey.
NEG 	I thought it would be a little stronger than what it is but it's alright, for the price it's really good. I used it in the automotive field and it serves its purpose
NEG 	it cover the land that i have and it smells good
NEG 	The Kids (ages 3 and 5) really liked it. I got a little shorted though because it was missing the first sticker sheet that goes with the first two pages in the book. It keeps them occupied for about 20 minutes adding the stickers and then they have fun coloring the page after.
NEG 	price was great. Fast delivery!
NEG 	Expected the bottom hem to hug my hips. It does not. The boxy fit at the bust does straight down to hem. Large fits nicely at bust. Good quality, nice weight. Good details. Nice muted blue color.
NEG 	After 2 weeks using them driving a forklift in a warehouse freezer, I decided to buy a second pair because they do a great job keeping my hands warm at work. They are great for keeping the wind out when im traveling on my forklift, though they dont have good grip for handling boxes otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.
NEG 	Really cool product, I have twin toddlers (2 years) it's big enough for both of them to play absolute mess free and nicely made. Well worth the price
NEG 	Great boat for the price. If you are looking to try out a boat, I'd give this one a try. It does favor one side a lot, but you can trim it to make up for it. I didn't find it to be that fast on windy days on a lake, but may be it's faster on a calmer day.
NEG 	Feels pretty ergonomic, but plastic seem a bit cheap
NEG 	The socks themselves are fine. I had asked if they would fit a 4 year old toddler and was told yes. They wii not fit a toddler.
NEG 	Didn't shed as much as I thought it would, but it did leave faint blue marks around my neck. Overall happy with the purchase.
NEG 	Assembly was easy with clear instructions. The only reason for a 4 rating is because of minor cosmetic issues. As you can see in the picture, there's was a scratch on the top part. There are 4 small metal L's that hold the key board tray: two of them were bent but I easily bent them back to their original shape. Also, on the underneath part of the desktop, there was a split/crack in one of the corners from the stud they placed where the screw would go. Other than those issues it seems like a nice desk for the price. The keyboard tray pulls out about 6 inches.
NEG 	Very easy to operate. It does throw off quite a bit of heat but I didn’t mind that
NEG 	Plain scent but it works perfectly
NEG 	Good product... Just what you expect in an 18 hour bra.
NEG 	The stockings fit but they kept rolling down. The sticky part didn’t work well at all. Future buyers may want to purchase garter straps.
NEG 	This is a cheap solution to missing or damaged bite valves on water bladders. Yes, they can leak a little bit. Not really any more than standard bite valves. I've gotten to the point that I buy the cheap bladders and sometimes the bite valves fall off or fail. Generally, the bladders are just as good as the full price ones, sometimes better.
NEG 	Excellent product for the price
NEG 	Only thing with the cord, is they don’t stay put in the phone . They come out Easily. the leds light are great to watch n the length is great.
NEG 	Eyes don't glow very well. Product came in good condition.
NEG 	So far it seems to be working okay. Sprayed the screen on our patio door and bugs are staying away. I sprayed the inside of the house around kitchen moldings and wowza the smell is sooooo strong! I ended up stopping with just the kitchen because the smell spread throughout our house so much I didn't know how we would sleep at night.
NEG 	i just received it. i will comment in detail when i start using it in a clinical setting
NEG 	Arrived in good time but arrived with a broken clip. It looks like the end was sowed off before being threaded through second eye on the clip. The clip was broken on one side and threaded through. When you pull it tight it will come out of place and slip loosely on your body. I taped it in place due to this being the only thing wrong. A time goes this will get replaced with something more sturdy. The rest is well made and works as advertised.
NEG 	For the money this is the best grow tent on market
NEG 	The nice and I give as a gift my husband love them and my son too
NEG 	They serve their purpose
NEG 	Really REALLY like everything about these glasses, except the polarized lens. They're very nice, very comfortable, and the carbon fiber really is flexible and durable. I just need to wear these AND be able to see the screen of a tablet at work. The polarization makes it difficult to view a phone/tablet screen.
NEG 	as shown,very pretty
NEG 	Makes interior detailing very easy. The big brush broke once but seller sent us a new pack. I highly recommend this.
NEG 	bought to replace the battery in my mom's phone that was draining too quickly. The replacement battery seems to drain just as fast, thinking it is the phone and not the battery. Battery works, charges without issues.
NEG 	Easy to use and not drying to the skin.
NEG 	Product was delivered leaking
NEG 	Fits on my oral-B well and have not had any problems with it thus far. Only complaint would be that I wish the heads were a little smaller like on a philips toothbrush head. However, I feel this cleans my teeth much more efficient then just the regular round heads. Will most likely order again once I run out.
NEG 	They fit perfect but as other people said they did start to tear apart at the heal fairly quickly. I only wore them for a few days on a cruise before they started tearing. Very comfortable though!
NEG 	Good pool kinda hell to take apart and the filter needs to be better and stronger but overall good value for the money!
NEG 	Interesting, historically accurate thriller. Novel has great pace an clever character development. I believe it gives a good feel for the turmoil in the Middle East today.
NEG 	Leaks coffee from around the bulb seal.
NEG 	This shirt is super cute!!!! I really didn’t know what was going to happen when I ordered this but i love it. The back is open which is pretty. The only reason i took a star away is because when I didn’t wear a bra you could see through the chest area. I got this in a color yellow so i might reorder in a darker color. If you’re not planning on wearing a bra with this like i was, order a darker color
NEG 	Nice cabinet for the price.... was very easy to put together by myself. Package came a little beat up but the product inside was fine.
NEG 	Wish the product came in a light brown or medium blonde
NEG 	Good funny u seen 1 and 2 duh watch the 3rd
NEG 	I had to throw away about 10 of them because they ripped so easily but this is a good size for something small and it is black.
NEG 	This book is all around made and I collect there will be more books made as times goes on. Indeed, even it will demonstrate to you how accommodating Alexa can be a major part of your life or who does it work or how to take fullest potential from this gadget. This book offered a little measure of information on my item, yet left me still oblivious in the matter of how to use it. the data in this book will let you know all that you have to think about Alexa's abilities.
NEG 	This scanner works pretty good so far...I was skeptical because of the price...I do a lot of driving for work, and I go over the speed limit when I'm running late... 😏... it's alerted me to officers I didn't see a couple times already. My only problem is not knowing what the different alerts mean (but I'm sure I can look it up) and I can't really understand the female voice that says stuff every once in a while...
NEG 	This is the third monk fruit product I've tried. It tastes better and dissolves more quickly than the other two. I use it in my morning coffee every day. Minus 1 star for price.
NEG 	Very good quality, works good, just wish the water came out stronger
NEG 	Super cute I do wish they each had a little bag or something to gift to individual teachers
NEG 	I ordered wrong part
NEG 	I got the 2mm earrings and they're perfect for everyday wear - although the 1mm would have been fine too. I gave 4/5 stars because they make my ears ITCH and HURT when it says it's sterling silver and not supposed to.
NEG 	I love the looks of these lamps, they are a gorgeous teal blue crackled glass. I took a star off because our “like new” warehouse deal lamps came in a battered box and dented lamp shades. They are on the backside so we decided to keep the lamps instead of dealing with the hassle of sending them back and waiting the 1-4 weeks for new ones to be sent.
NEG 	Timely and reasonably priced. No serious quality issues.
NEG 	These are not for long term, I have had to change out my jewlery for surgery. First night they came out. On some the backs were rough and on my lip piercing it cut into my mouth. These are more for single day use or you will be consistently trying to find the plug or replacing with if you have any extra.
NEG 	First of all it smells great! That’s my 4 stars. It’s smaller than what I thought but that’s on me for not reading dimensions well. There is no timer, otherwise would’ve been a five star. Otherwise would’ve been five stars for sure
NEG 	I need them and it's conveniently available to me. The doctor has a limit of three per day, but I need to test more often. Sometimes you have to be your own physician.
NEG 	I like a very good working.
NEG 	Easy to install and very happy with the battery life
NEG 	Good size came quickly easy to use
NEG 	Great story, just too short. I wish it was a full novel. The characters seem extremely intriguing. Hopefully the author will revisit this story .
NEG 	I haven't used it yet, just unboxed it, but it seems well made. The pad is manufactured by Dupont, again a good sign. Although I did wonder if it was stained in some way or if that's just the color scheme? see pic...
NEG 	A little shorter than expected.
NEG 	I like that the ends are looped with a nice rubber coated sleeve.
NEG 	I like it for the gym
NEG 	Works almost as good as my doctor prescribed meds, without all the side effects.
NEG 	A bit over the top but I liked it.
NEG 	Cute size, quite durable and they came with labels.
NEG 	The slim 3.5 male connector is perfect for connecting to my iPad/phone with a hard case and plugging it to a mixer for live shows. I noticed the sleeve was not tight and started to unscrew itself from the tip and caused scratches to the cable. Screwing it back on was no problem by hand. Great sound quality cable to have in my toolbox!
NEG 	My phone is cracked after using this it doesn't protect your phone that much
NEG 	Direct fit. No issues. Got the dryer back to drying in 30 minutes
NEG 	Not the best, not the worst. There were a few scents that I thought smelled a little different than usual, compared to other brands that I have used recently. I will probably try a different brand the next time I need more oils, I just don't feel 100% sold on these.
NEG 	They seem to be just what I needed.
NEG 	Great story, but feels a little drawn out. The narrative is probably worth 3 stars, but the depth of the research done elevates it to 4
NEG 	what my husband wanted. very happy
NEG 	They work great the only downside is they are like super long which I’m not a huge fan of but it gets the job done
NEG 	Is does not have an actual screen protector built in like i thought it would so that’s disappointing, i had to add one underneath, the case was a bit stiff and hard to put on but overall its good im not mad at it. This was a gift for my sister and she really likes it
NEG 	make sure you keep them in a plastic bag. the poor cap design leaks every where if the bottle tips even a little.
NEG 	It's a pen flashlight exactly as described just a tad bit too long in my opinion but other than that useful little thing to carry around in your pocket or car very bright. No adjusting anything. Has little clip four pockets and whatnot. I personally leave it next to my bed and use it at night when I get up and it's dark in the house as my personal little walk around light.
NEG 	Good heavy material for winter..hangs well
NEG 	I'm using my organizer in my classroom for my yearbook students. It holds their press passes and all the documents they need for their class.
NEG 	It was cute but not as bright as I thought it would be.
NEG 	I use this religiously. It does wonders for me with inflammation. I work offshore in the Gulf of Mexico as a mechanic and a machinist. My job is very physical. This helps.
NEG 	Socks are soft, comfortable and fit very well.
NEG 	This is a good product. Good coverage and very easy to install. Only problem i have seen is the touch sensitivity has decreased greatly. Some times It takes a couple of times to get something’s to react.
NEG 	The cats love it. They are able to be satisfied with this and never seem to be hungry. They were always wanting more food with the other brands. We use this per our Vet's recommendation. We have an older cat with urinary tract problems so all cats must have the same diet.
NEG 	Enjoyed the quick read. Although I was able to predict the next move in most cases. Either I am getting good enough to write them or the book is a very predictable read.
NEG 	The cover isn't water-resistant so the foam insert can end up soiled pretty easily. The foam also is pretty difficult to wash due to the size and it takes a fair amount of time to air dry, I've had to hand wash it a few times already and each time was frustrating... I suggest getting a waterproof cover if you get this for a puppy. Otherwise, put the foam inside a trash bag and tape the opening close to keep moisture from reaching the foam. So far it's helped decrease the amount I've had to wash the foam pad. And the cover still fits over the trash bag covered foam pad without issue. It's affordable, quality seems good on both the foam pad and the outer cover. The only issue seems to be that it's not water-resistant.
NEG 	Cutting quilt fabric
NEG 	I wish it were a bit larger.
NEG 	Works great - the instructions are a little confusing as it tells you to make sure the flame lock switch is in the off position, but it can only be moved once the torch is lit. I am guessing they have had many problems with it, because I got 2 emails from the supplier making sure I was aware of this (of course AFTER I broke mine trying to move it). It still works fine without the switch...I don't know that I will ever have a need for a flame lock switch, so not returning it. The instructions could probably be a little more clear.
NEG 	This product has worked the best after purchasing several more expensive products. I do find it time consuming to clean the hair from the glove but still satisfied. My dog sheds sooooo much, this glove has been helpful but he still sheds regardless of frequency of use.
NEG 	Love these!!!! So comfortable and keep me nice and warm!!!!
NEG 	Love the game. Come join the fun!
NEG 	I enjoy this coffee as the flavor is not too light or too strong. I use half the sugar but still enjoy cream in my coffee.
NEG 	useful but too expensive
NEG 	Hat was damaged before shipping. The damage affected the quality. Company made the situation right and I would buy from them in the future. Very appropriated!!
NEG 	Works great, the only thing I don't like about it is that is shines bright blue when charging. First night I had it in my bedroom at night to charge, the whole room lit up. Kind of hard to sleep with a big, bright, blue room. Other than that, it works great for charging!
NEG 	Way bigger than I thought they would be, but they work very well! Super soft and plush, I will definitely buy again.
NEG 	Having too many micro USB cables and only 2 lightning cables, I needed an adapter that would allow me to use those cables and not have to remember to always carry one of the 2 that work with Apple products. This way I can also have a spare cable available at work, since my iPhone always seems to run out of battery in the afternoon, and have others in more locations so that I don't have to go looking for the right cable to charge things when I need to.
NEG 	Came on time. One of the bottle was broken from the shipping. But for the price and the amount I dont mind. I would have given it a 5 star if none were broken
NEG 	Easy to hold and use. Magnification is not bad as stated. It comes with nice bag for storage. My 3 yr old loves to use it.
NEG 	Super comfy! A little small.
NEG 	Very good for my 2 cats, keeps the smell away
NEG 	I buy this tea for my father-in-law who is more of a coffee drinker and isn't fussy about tea. I personally find it fairly harsh and not a soothing beverage. Organic teas that cost more tend to have a better flavor and go down better, even black. Still for the price, it's not bad.
NEG 	I purposely avoided ordering the narrow version but these feel narrow. I do like the soft footbed though. Can't beat birks!
NEG 	I give this book almost 4 hearts So this is the story of Sarah a beautiful young woman that is abducted by aliens. That said she shows no fear and finds her self having some serious bed time with her captor. However not long after she arrives the ship she is on is under attack and she is taken by yet a different group of E.T.’s! So she is now with the other alien species this fella is named Gar and turns out the first group were bad news, think influence you to do what they want. Before she knows it sexy Gar has her in the throws of passion, hubba hubba. Seriously it’s a little crazy the aliens definitely have a thing for this hot little human. However things are never quite that easy.... soon enough Sarah finds herself captured by yet another group of aliens where she meets a surprising individual but up she is abducted by the bad guys again oh no will Gar be able to save her?? A cute fast sexy ET read give it a try it’s certainly hot enough. ** reviewer for romance authors that rock
NEG 	Nice colors and sturdy
NEG 	Does the job. I llike it. I prefer it to the round style much more.
NEG 	It’s a little unstable when at it’s full height, but since that’s too tall for me anyway the desk if great!!! The extra shelf works perfectly for my double monitors! Shipping had a small chip but it doesn’t face my side so I let it go.
NEG 	I gave the Boys Camouflage LED Sport Watch as a Christmas gift. It was well-received.
NEG 	Handy item to better hold your cell phone. My case has some a slight sand-papered surface, so the strap device has lost its adhesion a time or two, but always sticks back on. I have a magnetized cell phone holder in my car so I placed the strap off center to the back of my phone so it would not interfere with the magnet.
NEG 	This book is totally intriguing
NEG 	Great fit, nice material and easy to install. Rubbed leather conditioner on band about putting it on, for easy break in, worked great.
NEG 	This fan is very powerful, it clips wherever you need it. Would have given it 5 stars, except it was missing some screws. Otherwise it has exceeded my expectations. I love this fan.
NEG 	I just received it and it seems to be working fine I just haven't had that really hot and humid day yet to really see if it keeps my apartment cool...
NEG 	Most delicious and fresh tasting
NEG 	Arrive on time very pretty. It is a Christmas present. So I don't know about the cold or hot statics yet.
NEG 	Very cute but gave it a 4 because of the spacing of the hooks. I use this for 3 leashes and cant really but the leash on the hook have to loop the collar. Would be better used probably for coats or keys.
NEG 	I’m short and this doesn’t cover my entire belly including the lower pouch. Other wise it’s pretty good for the price
NEG 	Great set for running cables.
NEG 	Usually wear a small but since the suit runs small I went with a medium, I’m 5’2, 135 lbs, 34 b bra, and wear a size 4-6 bottoms.
NEG 	Pretty tough to rate sturdiness and durability after two days but I can say it survived removal from the packaging materials. I bought these because my phone was failing to charge on the old cords...now it charges plugged in one way but not the other....phone or cord? Your call.
NEG 	These are very lightweight plastic. I was expecting something a little more sturdy. It did not hold a standard plastic water bottle as it fell out during a ride. Otherwise it is a good price for what you get.
NEG 	Fun read by an author that usually writes heavier stuff. There were a few inconsistencies pertaining to the game of football, but overall it was pretty good!
NEG 	This thing pumps the water so well that I haven’t figured out how to keep water in the bird bath for more than an hour ay a time!! Any suggestions??
NEG 	Holds all my necessary information and is pretty easy to read. Band is a little bulky but it's not a deal-breaker. I like the silicone band; no issues with getting wet or dirty.
NEG 	Needs a clip to hold the phone in place.
NEG 	I enjoyed the books. The story was for the most part interesting. Loved how time travel was incorporated into the story, and how it showed opposites attract.
NEG 	Best price I can find for a good bar of soap. Works well, smells good and not over scented which would bother my nose.
NEG 	Loved it . Very light weight and enough room to hold spare items in the main part plus a water bottle. Only downside is it could use two zippers on small outside pocket. Closing one zipper all the way round was inconvenient to stop small things from falling out
NEG 	works well popping in the microwave with a silicone popper
NEG 	Nice size, fresh product.
NEG 	Great glue, but it always glues the cap to the bottle which is nearly impossible to open!
NEG 	Great product, great price! didn’t give it 5 stars because they are kinda hard to blow up. Other than that, we love them!
NEG 	It’s great for backpacking...good taste....however, the texture of watery eggs is something I had to get used to. But, you can’t beat the ease of preparation for the dehydrated meal and a hot breakfast of eggs & bacon on a cold morning.
NEG 	A little hard to install.
NEG 	My only issue is that the USB-C cable, from the hub, is too short. Everything else about the size and number of ports is nice and functional.
NEG 	good flavor when mixed with eggs, just don't add any salt to the eggs
NEG 	Just installed and so far so good. Very easy.😀
NEG 	Exactly as described
NEG 	It was of good quality and my girlfriend loved it!
NEG 	I decided to order this UTG rear sight ( I ordered the front sight too) for my semi-budget AR build, and am pleased with my purchase. The sight seems well made from aluminum, however the press to release button function is a little stiff. I applied some lube which helped, and I am sure that with use it will free up more. The price point was probably the biggest selling point, that and feeling pretty confident I wasn't getting some cheap MagPul PTS sight or a knock-off. I haven't had time to get to the range yet, but I'm pretty sure it won't take too long to get them sighted in.
NEG 	Quality product for cost of item.
NEG 	I love the look of these and they looked fantastic hung up. However, we decided to return them because they are too shear and don't provide enough privacy.
NEG 	Does help the soreness go away
NEG 	I love the case. It came just as pictured. The only thing I wish I had paid attention to is the fact that it doesn’t come with a screen protector but other than that I love it!
NEG 	This tape is really a good product for the price. I have been using it often and it’s strong enough for the jobs. Delivery was also fast.
NEG 	Great purchase for the price.
NEG 	Very pretty. They weren’t as rose goldish in color as I expected but they are still really nice for the price.
NEG 	I like the wallet and I can put a small lip-gloss in the zipper but the heart and phone are upside down. I guess that is on purpose??
NEG 	Good quality, good price. I just wish it was a little longer.
NEG 	heavy, good home plate
NEG 	Knowing how to use a product is always important in order to get the most of it. This battery used properly on the right power savings settings is lasting me about 3 hours or so. Also consider that different laptops have apps and programs running in the background draining the battery, you have to optimize your system to get the best use of your battery power. Considering that is a replacement product with a good price in comparison to paying over $100 for the actual factory battery, this battery is great for the value. Before posting negative things I encourage everyone to set it up properly and it will do its job.
NEG 	Good tv had it for a while. However shortly after purchase had one black line going through it. Their support said it was normal to have it so I disregarded it. I then found out recently through a close friend that he got his replaced over a black line said it can lead to future problems. Feel a little betrayed but overall the tv had worked fine. So if you get one be picky about stuff even if it don’t seem too big.
NEG 	I wish the fabric had been a cotton blend, but I do love the top
NEG 	Good, but cards are really hard to get out of pockets
NEG 	Paper isn't the quality I thought it would be, but nice layout.
NEG 	Good product and fit perfectly.
NEG 	My kids LOVE this product! We live in an apartment with no back yard and this is so helpful to get their energy out without having to leave the house. My 3 & 5 year old spend hours jumping and climbing and doing tricks everyday. Within 3 weeks our tube popped. I emailed customer service and they were very quick in response and mailed me a new tube within a week. The new tube is a different brand and much sturdier than the first. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I am slightly disappointed that for how much it costs you don’t get the complete package with the colorful tube cover and bumpers to cover the nuts and bolts at the top. Overall, I’d still totally buy this and would suggest any friends buy it as well since it’s easily my Children’s favorite toy and it helps them be active 🙌🏻 Win win!!
NEG 	Product seems fine but will note it's a little small for the 2018 gmc terrain. I expected it to fit like a phone screen protector.
NEG 	Bought as a gift for my friend he loves it. I kinda wanted to keep it for myself, but I already have one
NEG 	Been wearing them for 5 days both to bed and all day. The pain has only been in my right heel. Since wearing these the pain is almost totally gone during the day. I feel some just when I wake up or have been sitting for hours at my desk at work and get up to walk. But the discomfort level is reduced by about 80 percent.
NEG 	Awkward, not like a rubber stamp but.. yes it does make a stamp. Turned a photo of my cat into a stamp
NEG 	Good bang for your buck. We have gotten some good use and enjoyment out of this. There is some work in getting the screen attached to the blow up stand, but otherwise it is just fine.
NEG 	Typically pricey Aveda product, but I like the scent and it does a good job cleansing my hair.
NEG 	This is a very decent set of taps for the price. They are not made to the tightest possible tolerances but work well enough for my purposes being used for low stress joining of pla plastic parts. I bought a different set from a different seller, for more money and they arrived loose in a ziploc, this set came in a nice case.
NEG 	I have 5 identical strips wired up with these.
NEG 	Very pretty on night rides easy to put on, although no directions came with product
NEG 	There is so much great info in this book that I have already read it twice! Thank You! I would have given 5 stars but there were quite a few spelling errors and typos. Other than that, very good information. I especially enjoyed the part about switching from an employee mindset to an entrepreneur mindset with the help of business oriented positive affirmations. I would recommend this book to anyone considering a career change who is entertaining the idea of starting an online business and ways to generate passive income.
NEG 	Works great, only downfall is, if you have a smaller wrist and hand like I do, it doesn't fit quite right, it still works but my pinky doesn't stick out and theres excessive material just hanging out.
NEG 	Nice feel , quality product, fits the G5s plus just perfect.
NEG 	A little over the top. He near wipes out two cartels and one leader. He may be good, but I doubt if he is that good.
NEG 	Smells nice, cleans your face, good price.
NEG 	This is a good foot bath for home use. The bubbles and heat are a great addition.
NEG 	I like this tape but do find it flimsy. This is fine for my card making and is a good deal.
NEG 	Fun, a few new twists from other sized games. Worth a try, so join the fun.
NEG 	We bought this for my son to use during a 13 hour car drive. This did help though he found it annoying and it did have issues with the Velcro being strong enough to keep his head within the headrest.
NEG 	Bought these about 14 months ago. I noticed the plastic starting to crack like 4 months ago. It cracked in three places. Right in the middle on the top and on both sides right above the hinge. The top crack is finally bad enough that I covered it in duct tape to hold on. It would benefit from having some metal braces instead of just cheap plastic, but that’s what you get for 20 bucks. Sound quality is ok and they are comfortable enough to wear for 6 hours straight. They fit over my ears ok despite other reviews. Not awful for a $20 pair of headphones.
NEG 	Great dress! Great buy, the only reason I have four stars instead of 5 was because it was a little big on me and didn’t fit me like the other dresses that I bought from them, but I’m guessing because this one is long sleeve. Overall I love it!
NEG 	I bought this as a travel mirror, as hotels don't always have an idea setup for make-up application. It helped quite a bit for this purpose. The fact that it doesn't require removable batteries is a huge plus, as you'll never wind up with dead batteries. (As long as you have it charged, OR, you're near an outlet or laptop that will recharge it via USB.) The angle of the mirror is fixed, which is the only slight problem, depending on the height or angle you need. Otherwise, a nice convenience for travel.
NEG 	Great product easy to install
NEG 	The towels are very nice. Good construction. Nice fabric. Note! The colors bleed on first wash, which is likely my fault because I didn't use COLD water. (They still look good, a little blue.)
NEG 	Still got a little bit of dust under the screen even though I was cleaned it thoroughly prior to installation
NEG 	I just received a package of 10 if these in medium; they’re surprisingly good quality for the price & about half are from from recognizable brands. Nice fabric, good mix of styles.... My only complaint is the size- they run large in my opinion. For reference I’m 5’7, 127 lbs and usually wear a small or medium. After seeing reviews saying they run small, I ordered mediums - but these are larger than average mediums, and quite big on me. I would still recommend these just caution not to assume these run small- and I will probably order more in a size down because overall I was pleased. Photos show variety of colors and styles I received (no duplicates!)
NEG 	I like that the scoop is large, and that it scoops litter much quicker. Only complaint is the handle. It is not comfortable to hold. Might be better for a person with larger hands.
NEG 	Son likes it first time player.
NEG 	The pillow case, zippable, is wonderful. The first night I used I put my pillowcase on it. It was stuffed and I knew it would too high. However, I used it. My neck ache was worse. I removed three handfuls of the foam the next night. It was better. Removed four more large handfuls that night. Much better next morning. Future buyer: you may have to adjust the amount of filling to suit your needs.
NEG 	Seems to work okay in keeping my lines down. Can't really notice too much though.
NEG 	These sound fine, and they seem pretty durable. I don't like the volume controls, it only alters the sound coming from the earbuds and not from the phone.
NEG 	I disliked the Roosters being upside down on one of the placemats. The cushions were all done correctly and I really do like the set, except for the Roosters being upside down. Thank you
NEG 	The only complaint I have is that the "second cover" is really the only cover and does not attach to the ironing board .
NEG 	Love these! But they tend to run on the smaller side.
NEG 	I like the inexpensive price. I like that it is not on WiFi so it cannot be hacked. The night vision is very clear. It was easy to hook up. The signal did disconnect one time but it was easy to reconnect again. I dislike - The screen is like a second sun. It is SO bright at night. I have it on Eco-Mode just so I can sleep (the screen goes black until it registers audio). But then there's a blinking green LED light to let you know the monitor is on, and that too is extremely bright. I also dislike how flimsy the parent monitor is. With the cord plugged in, the parent unit becomes unbalanced and tips over easily. Overall, I recommend it for anyone looking for an inexpensive video monitor. There are probably better ones out there, but not for the price or ease of use.
NEG 	I like it. It looks good and is pretty bright. I just cant find a decent holster for it.
NEG 	Didn't have it long when it was needed to clean a spot and it worked well. Handy to have, glad we got it.
NEG 	Bought two of the bronze curtain rods and they are beautiful. This product intrigued me because it looked simple to install which it is very easy however no directions came with either box and had to look them up online. That was the only downfall.
NEG 	I love that they come with an storage container. But I don’t like that they are very large compared to my old ones, but they are very wearable.
NEG 	Great price & cut through multiple layers of heavy fabric. I will definitely buy again.
NEG 	It came very fast and I received it yesterday... I had nice packaging. Nothing was broken. But the only thing was it was kinda hard to wash the wax off of it. and I used mine of the fake scar for Halloween. Lastly, the last problem was it was not that sharp.
NEG 	I like the scent and the packaging. However it's kinda difficult to spread on. Not a deal breaker, just an observation.
NEG 	Daughter loves it, especially if there is a thunderstorm it seems to calm her. We have 2 for my daughter and the only downside is for some reason the battery doesn’t last very long.
NEG 	I use this headset primarily on my XBOX One S, plugged directly into the 3.5mm jack on the controller. The sound was not loud enough out of the box for gaming on my XBOX but once I plugged it into my little booster that came with a different headset many years ago I found the sound to be very loud and had to turn it down. I do not have the low sound issue on my PC. I honestly didn't think i would get anywhere near the quality output at the price I paid. As an added bonus the headset is more comfortable than another high end headset I used to own. If you are looking for a headset that will not break the bank and is actually useful, you should be pleased with this one.
NEG 	Good like the detail chain is a bit weak when it get caught on items
NEG 	I don’t like these as much as the regular Ticonderoga pencils as they feel a bit rough. The eraser doesn’t work as well. But they write just as good.
NEG 	Seems to work fine. Cant rotate sensor or switch temperature reading to F however
NEG 	There is nothing worse than being lost in the jungle, except for being lost in the desert!
NEG 	Board is nice and heavy and well made. The hardware is great to plumb the board. Heals nice. Packaging is not so great... board had a dent on the outer rim from being dropped or something (did not effect game play).
NEG 	Loved these! They taste like peanut M&ms, only better. Shipped fast and will definitely be purchasing again. I left off one star because the price is a bit high for the small size bag.
NEG 	Is easy, and mindless play. Deb
NEG 	Interesting story. The perspectives of celebrity media - both how it's used to manipulate the public and manipulate the celebrity- is used to tell the story of an actress moving her way up the Hollywood ladder and the many things she has to hide, fight, fake, and exploit. And then a writer who gets rich off of the ultimate celebrity gossip: the tell-all. It sounds petty and shallow, but really, it was a good read.
NEG 	The rock painting Kit is a Christmas gift therefore I won't know the details until after Christmas
NEG 	Good quality mug. I ordered two at different times. Both came wrapped in thin cheap bubble wrap and thrown in a box with other items. One made it to me safely, the other did not. I had to exchange the broken one, but it was at no cost to me. If you are ordering it at the last minute, have a backup in case it arrives broken.
NEG 	This is a good and sturdy phone case but that side button is a bit tricky.
NEG 	Much better than emery boards but not the best glass/crystal nail files; not as fine as others I have purchased.
NEG 	Bought them for my dock but they are a little small for that. I’ll probably use them like lots of the reviewers do, for furniture, serving trays, towel hooks, etc. not worth sending back.
NEG 	I really like this set and now having wedding rings I can wear when doing yard work or at the beach.
NEG 	Love having the mat to catch food and water. My dog picks up the bowls and makes a mess so I’m only giving it 4 stars.
NEG 	Really like the color and style. Fits perfectly, feels good to know my tablet is protected. Wish it could stand on its own without support otherwise really great buy.
NEG 	I was real excited to get the coat only to be disappointed by the size. It was 2 sizes too small. Very upset that I'll be sending it back!!
NEG 	This is a very bright red henna. This quantity will probably last me a year. I'd say it's pretty good quality.
NEG 	Keeps my hat from that horrible sweat stained look!
NEG 	the pillow covers are outstanding workmanship . I would recommend to my friends. The fabric is wonderful and i am sure will last a very long time. Thank you for prompt delivery!!!
NEG 	I love this Knife block ... And I'm not sure this doesn't apply to all blocks ... The longer knives stick out the bottom potentially scratching whatever surface they are on. knife blocks on the knife block are a very good idea. Consider that, designers. I just taped a piece of cardboard on the bottom, BUT , Why do I have to?
NEG 	I bought this for myself. To season my cast iron and cook with. Works well. Additionally, I tried simmering my dog's bones in it. She loves them.
NEG 	I previously bought another slip cover that works fine, maybe just as well, but is more confusing because it doesn't have the labeling this one has or the convenient case (I like to flip-flop between covers while one is in the wash). This didn't come with any washing directions, but I believe the product description said it's machine safe. I just use the same instruction that came with my other cover. 4 stars is as high a rating as you can give a slip-cover. Granted, my dog is particularly big, but the cover doesn't stay perfectly in place and the product overall is a glorified fitted sheet.
NEG 	These would be a 5 star if they were a little longer for just a but more support other than that these are super comfortable I noticed a big difference as soon as I put them on!!! Definitely recommend to anyone with foot pain!!!
NEG 	Good pair of sticks, it's like a longer 2B
NEG 	Make sure to buy you some Dewalt blades for both saws, the ones it comes with are gonna snap on you first use, mark my words. Don't even try to use them, throw them away and install a better brand blade, you won't regret it. The set came with a back up battery... good thing because you'll need it if using for an all day project. 5 hours use requires both batteries and of course the tools' power output cannot touch a Craftsman or Dewalt when you really need it for specific jobs, BUT all in all, gets the job done and great set for having basic tools on hand for DIYers at home!
NEG 	I had initially thought there would be quality issues given the price. But after I started using it, the case seems great. The case gives everything as it is promised in the product description. *I like that*
NEG 	Thought it was a bit longer most likely my misread. Other than that still works and gets the job done.
NEG 	I gave it only 4 stars simply because I have not used the product. I ordered it to the wrong address and the people there acted like they never received a package. There is not much I can do, I screwed up not Amazon or Concealment Express. I am a broke college student and cannot afford another at this time. Maybe in a few months I can give a full review.
NEG 	My a.c. in my car don't work so I needed something to make it cooler but with this fan you need cooler air already to feel cool air coming from it.
NEG 	Great little flashlight! Good lighting distance. Hand crank a bit awkward until you get the hang of it. Does what it claims.
NEG 	Unit would not work with a new 64 GB memory card. Had to use a 32 GB card of same speed/manufacturer of 64 GB. Also, supplied power cable defective. Does not power unit, but red LED is on 12 VDC plug. Be aware, unit uses a micro USB connector, so don't order the wrong in-car cable. A mini USB will not work (Too large). Pleased with operation using a 32 GB card and another manufacturers micro USB cable. Mobile app also seems to work fine, so far. Update: Manufacturer send a new cable to replace defective one. Took several weeks to get here from China, but it works.
NEG 	What a lovely book full of atmosphere and suspense.
NEG 	Easy to install good quality heavy duty better-than-expected
NEG 	The light is bright but it does not hold a charge long
NEG 	Good quality, but a bit stiff. Credit card pockets are tight.
NEG 	i really like this mechanical pencil. i use it for writing, sketch and construction type activities instead of a fat pencil
NEG 	This is the third different type of menstrual cup I’ve tried. 3 cycles in, I’m still trying to get the hang of the emptying part as the little knobbies that help you figure out where to squeeze are pretty tiny and a little hard to find. But when you get them, it works pretty well. It leaks a little, but I’ve yet to find one that didn’t on the first couple of heavy days, so I always wear a pad as backup. But my cervix and uterus are tilted, so it’s expected. It gets me through all day at work without leaking through a pad, which is what I wanted out of menstrual cup. I think once I get the hang of the emptying part, I’ll like it even more.
NEG 	Belt loop holes are huge.
NEG 	This is cute, but there is no pillow included. And I haven't found one locally that will fit, so I will have to order one. My daughter loves it
NEG 	Good bags. I can keep all small things for my small daughter
NEG 	It works pretty well, but, does require a perfectly flat surface to be mounted on. Would be nice if it came with an option to help (like some sort of adhesive mounting option). We opted for this because our shower head has a 1 in. diameter base, and it holds onto it just fine.
NEG 	Looks nice, and is functional. difficult instructions.
NEG 	These are comfy and fit fairly well. I'm not in love with the stiff texture; I imagined they would feel more like the super soft laser cut undies you can get from VS.
NEG 	Too small for my D cup. The material is nice abs and soft. It is just too small for me. It showed too much of my midriff.
NEG 	loved the price and style, and she says very comfortable
NEG 	Great for low flights, it's not a drone that's going to compete with mobi but it's great for practice and for kids.
NEG 	This laptop backpack is durable, fashionable, and perfect for travel. The only downside is that the handle cannot be slipped over the shoulder and carried like a tote.
NEG 	They fit perfect but I did buy a size bigger
NEG 	The only think that's a bit concerning is that the ends tend to curl up a little and will not lay flat.
NEG 	This bottle fits my 2018 F150 cup holders, barely, but it fits. I saw conflicting reviews on whether it would fit in cupholders, I took a chance because I have a larger vehicle. My guess is if you are driving a truck or SUV, it will fit. I am not a big fan of the plastic insert and the bottle feels a little cheaper than some of the other stainless bottles out there. The outer shell seems a little thin. Neither are really a deal breaker though, and for the price it still gets 4 stars from me.
NEG 	This series just keeps getting more and more interesting. I really enjoyed this book, but it is not a standalone book. You really need to read the entire series in order. I highly recommend this series and can't wait for the next one.
NEG 	A good product. Works well with foaming soap
NEG 	These work very well. Super thin and flexible so you can easily hide the cord when you have to stretch it out across the room.
NEG 	Have never a lock where I could set my own combination number. How perfect. Kids will always know which makes it great for school. Took a bit to figure out how to set but all you have to do is read carefully and look at pics. Nice size and easy to use. A four star because I think they could be easily smashed with a hammer or object. Maybe a plastic of sorts. Just wouldn't use for something expensive to lock up. Perfect for school lockers and especially kids who have problems remembering the combination.
NEG 	A little harder than i wanted. But not bad.
NEG 	Not a bad candle, but I do feel the scent could be stronger. My wife was pleased with it, so I can't complain too much. I did get an email from the seller asking if i was satisfied shortly after it was delivered, that was a nice touch.
NEG 	My speaker is really loud and I’m happy about it... The instructions were simple and easy to follow but ... I didn’t receive any cords to charge the speaker or connect it to anything ... and still waiting for a response from the supplier or Amazon
NEG 	Love these bowls This is the second set I have bought. They work great. They are microwave safe.
NEG 	Works as expected, it does take a while to dissolve.
NEG 	Great set!! Exactly what I expected!!
NEG 	Would have like the diameter larger and the depth smaller, but this will do.
NEG 	Looks great on my ford f 150
NEG 	Product starting working after 5 mins. Instructions says to leave on for 5 to 8 minutes without making facial expressions which is hard when you have kids around. When dry you could feel your face tightening up. This is my first time buying an eye product and I like it so far.
NEG 	Bumper arrived in good shape one small ding. Looked great and fit perfect. Before ordering check to be sure you have mounting hardware on your frame it had previously been removed and a roll pan bumper installed. Took several weeks to find missing hardware. I finally located what I needed in a parts yard.
NEG 	It will be a gift to a 3 year old. I wanted a flying pig but that was no longer available; I gave a flying pig to my daughter 30 years ago and she was enchanted with it. I hope the flying cow gives as much pleasure to the granddaughter.
NEG 	Pleasantly Surprised! More comfortable than my 4in memory foam! I'm buying another one now for a guest room
NEG 	I have four of them and really like them
NEG 	You can hear static noise when loud like my iPod is little higher sound while my iPhone is lower sound so static is more when using iPhone but barely hear it until it’s quiet or music beat down
NEG 	$10 glasses. I can't really complain or rave about the quality. If your looking for cheap pair of sunglasses Id certainly recomment these.
NEG 	These fit just fine. That is why I ordered a second set.
NEG 	When Hestia leaves her father's home to be a companion, she realizes she's giving up her position as the daughter of an Earl. She also will probably never have a chance to get married an be happy. She has been hired as companion to Lady Eugenia and is responsible for helping her find a suitable husband. When Lady Eugenia decides that they should attend a house party and both look for husbands, Hestia is hesitant. When she meets Lord Price they are instantly drawn to each other. Too bad he's already betrothed to a woman his father has decided would be an excellent match. Will they ever find their way to each other? I'm always intrigued by the whole arranged marriage scenario where the parents don't care how miserable their children will be as long as it benefits their purpose. This book is a perfect example.
NEG 	How do you pair 2 of these ??????
NEG 	Nice item, fast shipping, good seller Smooth, but I changed writing tip to .5mm and using the cross ink! Can't find micro point refills for this one...
NEG 	Very fast and practical. There is a problem with accentuation in Portuguese. Other then that, exactly what I expected
NEG 	Went an entire year and took over 10,000 pictures on the AA Lithium Batteries and there still not dead. However, bought 2 of these cameras both are still working but one the daytime pictures are pink?
NEG 	It fits with the bottle although it leaves a small gap where the top and the bottom meet. It’s also very easy for baby to move it around but it does give that extra help for babies to grip the bottle better.
NEG 	It works, i have dropped phone several times directly on its face. have lost several screen protectors but my original iphone 7 screen remains intact. I have bought several because once they crack in the slightest my OCD wont allow me to keep it on there. Price is good but the glass itself could be a bit stronger. All in all it serves its purpose and does not feel cheap.
NEG 	This case will fit the tablet but it may take you a few tries to get it to snug down. I expect the snugness of fit may have something to do with the room temperature but I could be wrong. All I know is yesterday I couldn't fit the tablet in the case and today I can. So, it looks good and should work well.
NEG 	Arrived quickly and works as advertised. Packaging could be better.
NEG 	So, the blue is not the same as pictured. It's, actually, a light baby blue rather than a royal blue. Other than that, it's a great bottle. Tall, wide mouth, locking flip top lid, lighter weight than I thought it would be but very solid.
NEG 	I’m normally a 14-16, and was hesitant to order these because I assumed the XXL would be an American 6. They fit a little snug, but aren’t too tight. Incredibly low rise, I’m not sure how they will work for daily wear. Cute patterns and decent quality, you will have a panty line.
NEG 	Great shelves, nice and strong. Easy setup and easy to install. I left the front poles off to give it the floating shelf look. The items on the shelf are not heavy so it works. Would have giving 5 stars but one of the shelves was dented.
NEG 	That's about all you can say it works.
NEG 	At first I thought these were too small. I get slightly larger at the hardware store but found these do work better for my crafting and you get a lot more for the money. I will order these again.
NEG 	Have only used a week and it Has added moisture to make my skin softer
NEG 	For the price point I'm keeping this and will try to figure out how to clean up the white smears all around it. Just got it today, these photos are of the item straight from the box to the Jeep. Very easy to put on, 31" fits perfect on my wheel.
NEG 	I love how it looks, very sleek matte red color and design. Not very durable or protective, but it presumably isn't designed to be. It protects the body of the phone from scratches and that’s about it.
NEG 	Love this set. BUT there seems to be a specific way things like to be put back in the pouch. Taking out the fork or spoon and trying to put it back I feel like I’m going to break the pouch. Luckily the pouch is very durable! If you aren’t looking for style points but necessity, convience and/or a handy compact set of silverware you won’t regret grabbing this set. I’ve already used mine more times than I can count, surprising how often I’ve found myself pulling my silverware out. I don’t like using plastic utensils and this has made my life style change choice very easy!
NEG 	Wonderful characters. Manipulating mother. Stubborn son. Loving wife. Fun loving children. It had a bit of everything. It's a must read.
NEG 	I bought this for my Yorkie. Good fit. Very cute.
NEG 	It’s amazingly beneficial in every way possible. I’m very happy with this purchase.
NEG 	I like the slim simple design. I wish there was a definitive way to know if they are working, though
NEG 	so they are not very bright so dont expect them to be but for the value and price you cant beet this!
NEG 	Works good. Sometimes have issue with it pinching, but once a move around a bit, it’s fine.
NEG 	Wish it was a little bigger but its still good
NEG 	I liked the product. Wasn't properly sealed, shampoo spilled in the bag.
NEG 	Good shave for the price.
NEG 	The tie stings just fall out, but I don't use them anyway.
NEG 	The wristband is pretty and the right color (rose gold). The little tool that came with it helped with taking links out to make it fit, but some instructions would have been nice. Also I really thin fingernails that bend under any pressure, so when I attempted to open what I thought was the buckle my fingernails bent backwards, cause it was the buckle, it was just really tight, my boyfriend has to open it for me. What I’m concerned about, when my boyfriend took links out, he said the pins were rusty and said not to get it wet or sweaty, cause that will spread up the rusting.
NEG 	I got this in hopes that it wouldn't bother my son as much as the plastic one he currently has. It wasn't really much different for him and seems kind of flimsy, but we use it. I had high hopes for this product, but it is just ok.
NEG 	This is a great tool to use on long threaded bolts where you need to spin quickly, but can’t use a socket. It is especially useful on car struts, allowing you to remove the top nut, while holding the shaft with an hex or torx wrench. Used it to remove the Subaru struts, and this made quick work of it. Packing was not great. I ordered on tool set, and it was obviously used, and was missing a socket. Returned it and ordered another, that also looked like it was dragged across the floor. The retail packaging was worn and damaged, but it did no appear to be used. It could be the third party vendor who is selling old stock.
NEG 	These work fine but are slightly smaller than the original ones and are not exact fitment.
NEG 	Great for power outages
NEG 	The kids were trading them out and it made it easy to tell them apart because we had 2 Cosmos
NEG 	I've only had it for a short time, so i can't speak to the durability. But I love how this budget planner is laid out. It's been a big help in keeping track of my families expenses and deciding which financial goals are important to us
NEG 	Positive: Patched a long rip in our screen, and stuck very well. No issues with insects getting in, as tear is thoroughly sealed. Negative: Looks like you put a piece of tape over the hole in your screen. Is slightly opaque, not see-through like the screen itself.
NEG 	At first I thought it was dragging, then I realized that it was important to understand where her people came from and how she was raised, leading up to being a killer
NEG 	I bought the RGB+WW units to install in the steps of my composite deck. They were very easy to install and look great. They are very bright and have held up to the weather quite nicely. I have them dimmed down as low as possible, and they are still a little bit too bright for the steps, but they do the job and look really good. It would be nice if they made a model specifically designed just for steps that would angle the LED light field down instead of straight out. It would also be nice to see the finish available in a darker version, like bronze.
NEG 	Her review: Overall it was a good book. Characters made some knucklehead moves that aren't very believable. The mystery and book facts were fun.
NEG 	This works as expected but I'm rating conservatively until I re-ink this stamp to see how easy or messy it is. It says unlimited re-inking using an ink tube inserted into the side of the roller. Obviously this stamp doesn't work so well on glossy paper but works ok on the Amazon labels. You have to let it dry out a little before touching it and it does become slightly more legible when dry. If the letters you are inking over are large, I find the coverage isn't as good despite multiple swipes. The width is pretty decent and would cover up most items with 1 role. If it's really confidential, I'd suggest just shredding it for safe measure.
NEG 	Keep you warm. Runs one size large.
NEG 	Great product and price
NEG 	I would rather have a product with more Ammonia D in it. This is like regular Windex.
NEG 	So far this is a really good series. Action packed with lots of twists, turns and back stabbing
NEG 	The balloons were good. The pump provided was very helpful. My only complain is that a couple of balloons the unicorn drawing was not in the center.
NEG 	I expected the balloons and the backdrop.
NEG 	Brake wires are too long and protrudes from the rollator causing it to get caught in walk ways at home. Color ordered was red and got a burgundy one. What can i use on wheels to make the move freely?
NEG 	These look great in our freezer and are an interesting design. Most of the time it is pretty easy to remove the ice from the tray. However, sometimes it likes to stick itself in there and these are not as strong as the traditional ice trays. I have already broken one of them by putting too much pressure.
NEG 	My cat slipped out of his old harness. So I bought this mostly for the reflective strips. Cribbage is an outdoor cat and lurks and hunts at night. I came home one night and my headlights lit him up like Chernobyl , so I like the visibility. But the harness is quite stiff
NEG 	Haven't opened yet, because it's a Christmas gift. My 5 year old asked for a smart watch... and that wasn't going to happen, so I ordered him this item on sale. Fast shipping.
NEG 	I don't usually read too often but, decided to start reading from a list of top 10 books for leaders. I saw this in a TED talk and just had to read it. I am about half way through and Simon's insights are very useful.
NEG 	The book is the perfect resource. I can't wait to try out the many fun activities & help kiddos grow in their relationships! Very useful for younger/middle school aged kids. Lots of exercises and good tasks to teach social skills
NEG 	I really liked this cute fascinator to wear for a tea party. I gave it 4 stars only because the color was a bit off. I ordered white, but it looked a little gray or a bit dingy color white.
NEG 	Well made sharp purple is good and bright.
NEG 	Thought it would be bigger. Its made for the size of a child or small adult. It was quick to assemble and the grandkids love it.
NEG 	For glare and rain very good.the looks of my last post was better but I believe this pr.may have a more stable frame
NEG 	I wanted a tiered basket to display and hold functional and decorative items for the kitchen island - salt and pepper shakers, coasters, napkins, etc - without taking too much island surface space. I also wanted to be able to see everything so the wire grid was very appropriate. Assembly was simple, but insertions were not easy to keep straight with each level; slightly skewed.
NEG 	I enjoy this book, the characters are enjoyable.
NEG 	Cute top, fits as expected.
NEG 	It's good, it seems pretty solid and durable, would be even greater if you guys include the instructions for assembling.
NEG 	Like the way they fit and look
NEG 	Good amount and useful container, but the smell of the pics was very strong of chemicals.
NEG 	Item was lost in mail and the seller was very nice about a refund.
NEG 	it is for my son for swim class
NEG 	Charger works as expected! Came on time and way cheaper than buying from the Apple store
NEG 	Love my T6i I enjoy it very much. The accessories that came with it are super cheap but still functional.
NEG 	Thank you for a great price!
NEG 	Would be nice to have a longer range of effective misting. Used for screened patio during spring, summer, & fall.
NEG 	Was pretty easy to attach my bike and set it all up. It feels sturdy even when I'm pedaling fast. The noise is pretty annoying, but I'm still not 100% sure it's the fault of the stand or if it's my tire. Maybe both 🤷 Just have to crank up the music in the garage to drown it out as best I can.
NEG 	This makes popping caps of bottles really easy, and will usually do minimal bending/damage to the cap. This does not work with larger bottles that have a slightly larger cap on them.
NEG 	It’s can be difficult to read.
NEG 	I bought this to use with a MacBook Pro. It works fine and is nice and compact. Seems a little cheaply-made, but I don't anticipate using it that much so it should be fine. No complaints!
NEG 	Easy to assemble. Fairly stable for a tall structure. Covering is a bit thin but works. Tail fell off mouse the first day. We added some dangly toys. Ramps are not needed as my cat leaps up and never uses ramps.
NEG 	It’s a little too sweet tasting for me. But I think it helped with my cold
NEG 	Storage in my laundry room
NEG 	Good price for these plugs
NEG 	The Cardinals like it, so I like it.
NEG 	Bought a large & it fits good. These are loose fitting & fit like shorts. They are long. Good buy.
NEG 	I have a note 8 with a otter defence case. The phone fits snuggly inside. The flap a little short but does grabs the Velcro . Comfortable to ware.
NEG 	Nicely made quit cute
NEG 	Beautiful color, arrived earlier than expected, slime was cold and hard from being in delivery truck (broke apart instead of stretched). Once the slime warmed up it was more pliable and fun to play with.
NEG 	I was a loyal TurboTax user until they no longer supported my Mac operating system. I figured I'd give this software a try. It's almost same process as TurboTax but cheaper. Just follow the questions, fill in your info (or import it), and everything is calculated.I read a review about the update that doesn't update. It's true but a minor annoyance. A very good tax software alternative.
NEG 	Laptop overall was a good deal; only issue was the metal plate in the CD\DVD tray was bent which my husband didn't see until after the limited warranty period.
NEG 	I got restless three fourths through. I don't know if it was the writing or the subject matter. This is certainly different from most YA books.
NEG 	A good buy for the price. Would buy again.
NEG 	Very cute. But they do pinch a bit
NEG 	price is great, you get one for free compared to buying it in a retail/chain pharmacy/drug store
NEG 	I love 64 oz all in one container. It stays fairly cool all day. It is awkward to drink out of. You do need to drink from the side, if not the closure for the lid will be in the way of your nose.
NEG 	Works really great! Definitely an emphasis on SEMI permanent. It’s not lasting as long as I’d hoped.
NEG 	Love the size and the turtles themselves but the cord around them isn’t that comfortable to wear and difficult to adjust
NEG 	The ink cartridges work well and give satisfactory Print Quality. The HP Cartridge Design leaves much to desire as removing the shipping mechanism does tend to spill ink in its removal. A strip os sealing tape would probably work better.
NEG 	This product is lightweight enough for our older toddler to put it on the potty herself. One drawback is that urine sometimes gets trapped under the rim and then ends up on the big potty seat when the small one is lifted.
NEG 	Coffee, I thought, would stay hot longer.
NEG 	Expensive but worth it
NEG 	These are really nice and work well. When I opens the package they had a very strong plastic smell so I washed them in the dishwasher before using. After making muffins in them they do not have any more funky odor.
NEG 	Update: after posting my review they emailed me and are sending a new case free if charge. Great customer service and hoping the leak was just fluke! 😁😁😁 Loved the case had it about a week and a half and it's got a leak... never dropped or anything just woke up to a puddle under my phone 😣😣
NEG 	I like it just didn't know it was that big, I actually wanted one that I could carry in my pocket book. However haven't had a chance to use it yet. Thanks
NEG 	I’ve used these with all three of my pregnancies. The flavor isn’t great and the added ginger didn’t help at all with morning sickness but still gave me what else I needed
NEG 	Some were crumbled and broken but still tasty
NEG 	I love the material. It a little long but otherwise fits just right. If I would have went smaller I think it would have been too tight.
NEG 	Fun single action nerf revolver. Very accurate.
NEG 	Good quality light weight knee socks. Comfortable and tall.
NEG 	Though I did not notice a major difference in my blue light exposure I definitely found it easier to fall asleep after a full day of using devices within my workplace and also at home for leisure
NEG 	Works like a champ at about 150 ft from my house, direct line of sight. Could be sealed up better, which is the reason for 4 stars. But, works well and I have not had any false alarms yet. Worth the money over other competitors at a higher price point.
NEG 	works pretty well but the temperature monitor doesn't seem to switch kick in consistently.
NEG 	Works great for a small area
NEG 	Looks cute but cheaply made
NEG 	This is such a handy brow pencil with color and brush included.
NEG 	I purchased this Dec 2016. The outdoor part rings hit or miss since Jan 2019 and now despite a new battery, it is dead. I have to buy it again because I have it stuck to a sheltered door and do not want to pry it off and put on something with a different footprint.
NEG 	I was impressed with the sound quality considering their fairly low cost.
NEG 	Good quality tactical pants. Would buy again.
NEG 	Works great with G19 with TLR-1 HL. As with any light bearing holster there is a little room to really wiggle your finger down into the holster and touch the trigger but overall this isn’t an issue for standard carry. Also you ha e to really place the firearm in there the correct way or it gets finicky. Great concept for a paddle style holster 4/5
NEG 	Really cute and super simple to make into a costume. Seems a bit overwhelming on my smaller frame, but didn't take away from people loving it.
NEG 	Nice upgrade on the banking machine itself from previous versions however, it dumped all the banking info at random in the middle of the first and only game we've played so far...
NEG 	These are as good as any I've seen . Daymaker for sure. Easy to install. Can see good on side of road were deer come out. Cant beat price!!!
NEG 	Maybe priced a little high for the quality. Wouldn’t let more than fourty pounds ride it.
NEG 	Nice to get early news on weekends
NEG 	I really like how easy and straight forward this building goes together! No instructions needed, just looked at the pieces and put it together! I bought three such buildings and am ordering more. Works for my table! Wish they had a set of sci-fi buildings and such like this...
NEG 	Extremely well paced! Not a lot of ups and downs but continuous forward momentum. Great characters and sultry bad girls, loved it
NEG 	I've been taking this supplement for two weeks now- didn't know this will slowly heal my digestive problem. I was always constipated before, having that kind of feeling really sucks. but when I've started taking this, I now have regular bowel movements. I just take this supplement twice a day, for better results, make sure to hydrate your body! Hope this helps!
NEG 	These shoes are sturdy and fit my dog well. They don't seem entirely waterproof though. My girl walked through some puddles on a rainy day and had damp feet when I took them off her. I will give them 4 stars because the two rows of velcro keep them on snug and the soles seem sturdy as well. They also leave little star imprints on the ground which is cute. I'm still happy with them and plan to continue using them.
NEG 	It looks nice when finished, drawers hold things. We did not put the wheels on as this is for storage in the kitchen so it won't be moved around much. Do NOT ignore the instruction that two people are required. It is absolutely imperative that you have two people to assemble- one to hold the pieces snug together, and one to screw/nail the pieces together. It took my husband and I about 4 hours to put this together. The nails included don't work too well (very tiny, being a bit sharper would have helped), we had to hammer unbelievably hard to get the nails to go into the wood to attach the back to the unit and the bottoms to the drawers. There are a few places where the screw holes in one piece did not line up with the edge of the connected piece, which resulted in the screw cracking the wood and coming through the wood. We will need to cover these spots with tape so we don't cut ourselves on the screws when digging around in the drawers- this is why one star was taken off: poor planning on screw hole locations. I was tempted to rate it only 3 stars due to how difficult it was to put together, but it seems sturdy, and it's also real wood instead of particle board. It seems like it will last awhile. I guess ultimately I would rate it 3.5 stars if I could rate halfs.
NEG 	Good addition to the equipment pile. Nicely made and ideal size for may situations.
NEG 	Very nice looking case. Feels very durable. Buttons are nice. Being one piece, I don't have to worry about it separating. Only issue is that it's too slippery on the sides where I grab the phone. I'm very cautious but it nearly slipped out of my grasp too many times for comfort. I'm going to have to find a way to change the texture of the edges before I damage my phone.
NEG 	Fits great, I love the look and feel.. however, the screen protector arrived broken in the top left corner.. and the power button presses entirely too easy when completely assembled.. overall I'm only moderately satisfied with my purchase..
NEG 	It’s a textbook! Not much to love or hate about it. Just wish they were cheaper
NEG 	They are really thin, and honestly I feel like make more of a mess because the babe wants to put it in her mouth covering even more of her face with food. It does wipe off easily with a wipe.
NEG 	Did exactly as they are supposed to.
NEG 	Super cute! Just a little smaller than I thought.
NEG 	Tested this unit at the same time as a 4 gas detector and for the cost this unit is more than acceptable. I have had no issues with the unit.
NEG 	Great gloves for an excellent price. Lightweight and breathable, with a little bit of protection and cushioning. Perfect for summer hot weather riding gloves. Only negative is the fit - definitely size up one size. I also had to work mine in / stretch them out a bit to fit more comfortably, especially on the thumb. The seam digs into the end of thumb right at nail bed, really wad to work to soften the thumbs so I could wear. Even now it’s still a bit tight on the thumb, gets a little sore, but no long lasting effects. Overall happy and as gloves continue to break in they’ll get even more comfortable.
NEG 	I purchased this for my mother to use while our family was vacationing at Walt Disney World. It was lightweight, stable, had adequate storage, was easy to fold up, and traveled well. I took off one star because I couldn't find a cup holder that fit on it (I think it should be an included accessory). Overall, great price and value for a good product.
NEG 	I used the product as a bathmat in a standard 5 ft. tub. Prevents slipping, seems durable, and inexpensive. If I had time I'd look out for same qualities but something a little more aesthetic, either in the cut of the mat, clever cut-outs, interesting color or design/ print, that for me would go with a standard white tub.
NEG 	I threw them away once contaminated by a dead or pooping mouse but they look cleanable.
NEG 	Miscalculated price. Could have gotten them cheaper at post office. The immediate delivery was convenient.
NEG 	Only received one bulb, not two as pictured. Received bulb was damaged, but seems to still get the job done. Didn't realize until too late that I should've received two. No big deal. Great product, love using the balls for massage.
NEG 	Has a very nice leather smell. Not at all fake or cheap smell. Would recomend for car , boat or RV since in smaller areas lasts longer. Maybe for home office. Have been using in apartment and doesn’t last that long.
NEG 	For the cost it’s a good product. Wife uses it and only complaint was the massaging mechanism is to hard on her back. She does use it on her neck and legs. I started using and I probably like it more than my wife. Great for sore or stiff neck and shoulders
NEG 	Nice artwork. Mounting brackets are included BUT must be installed. Arrived quickly.
NEG 	I bought it for slicing meats and it works well
NEG 	I really love the size of these. They are perfect for my daughter to lay on the floor and color in.
NEG 	Purchased it for my 10 month old daughter and she loves it.
NEG 	I like the magnetic capability. I wish the product came in colors. I will have to paint it and hope that it will still be durable.
NEG 	A cute love story filled with charm and family. You will enjoy this one. Cowboys hesitate to get in a relationship but the cowgirl know how to round them up!
NEG 	I was looking for a mounting solution for my motorcycle gear, and found this. I bought a Three Pack for My Wife, a Friend, and Myself and the quality is great and it works well for hanging our helmets and riding jackets.
NEG 	I bought this for my 18 year old cat. He was roaming the halls at night, all night, howling for food. He just seemed to always be starving. I would feed him and 5 minutes later he would ask for more. I was feeding him wet food 5 times per day and he also had free reign over his kibble. I tried the drops on his food at the directed dose and within about 5 days he was much quieter and happier at night. He also eased up on his day time begging for food as well. Overall, he was a much more contented kitty. The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating is because after a few months he seemed to grow tolerant of the medication. He is starting to become very vocal at night again and seems to be getting ravenous again.
NEG 	Haven’t used them yet but he feels like they will work he wanted them for fishing . But he will not be able to wear them over his tennis shoes had to get a way smaller shoe to but them in got xxxl
NEG 	I thought the stones would be larger, but still a cute ring.
NEG 	I wanted a different looking case, and this fits the bill. Well made. Probably wished I would have bought a solid color. I think the pattern will grow on me.
NEG 	Good does it's job but made out of cheep plastic
NEG 	There was an overwhelming odor when I received the case. I washed it with mild soup and warm water and sat it in front of a fan to air it out, afterwards the odor was gone!
NEG 	I wish it was the same size as the original.
NEG 	I bought these for my daughters but borrowed one from her to wear for the complaint free nation challenge. Both my daughter and I really like the bracelets, however, after wearing one (the orange one) day and night for a month, the writing was starting to wear off. I ordered another set not only to replace the bracelet I borrowed from my daughter but I wanted a set for myself.
NEG 	I have waited for years for this sequel, although not as dramatic as the original, it was very good. I was glad all ended well for our heroes and the world was saved once again.
NEG 	It's a little too stiff even after washing it but it is very durable.
NEG 	Very nice for the price. Not a full 5 because it makes my skin slightly itchy sometimes, but other than that I can’t even tell it’s there, it’s so light. Just a casual glance you can’t tell it’s fake. This is a size 7.5, fits comfortably.
NEG 	Very cute but VERY small, the part that covered my butt was pretty much a thong.
NEG 	PROS: Detachable braided cable, more portable Black/red color scheme, usually fits with most setups Removable keys, can be replace with HyperX textured keys Quiet and responsive switches CONS: No wrist rest Keys are mistakenly pressed sometimes, would recommend a Cherry MX Brown option to the manufacturer Hard to type on
NEG 	I can feel very comfortable with it in my shoes.a litter long for me ,but it is ok.i cut it little .the product is made from high quality material.
NEG 	Works good hard to set
NEG 	This was very difficult to put together, thank goodness for YouTube videos explaining assembly. Very sturdy though and good looking.
NEG 	these are comfortable and breathable. They have some stretch and don't pinch. They are a little thinner than I would prefer, but overall, good.
NEG 	Use for keeping dog in yard
NEG 	nice design. Bit large but perfect for essentials.
NEG 	I originally bought this to grind coffee beans, but lately I have tried using it to grind granulated erythritol. It gets jammed every time. I wouldn't recommend for grinding to powder. We are able to get it working again after each powdery mess. Just taking it apart from the bottom of the device. Works well for coffee.
NEG 	The map is nicely sized and seemed sturdy enough if taken care of well. I do wish that there was a little bit more support on the backing but overall, it makes for a nice gift for friends with the travel bug.
NEG 	My daughter loves this product for my grandson
NEG 	no 5 starts because is not EOM, other than that great, cheap , works , good deal. Thanks
NEG 	Nice heft but finish wearing off quickly.
NEG 	Something is badly labeled here. Many reviews for children’s clothing and some other object mixed in with reviews of the plantar fasciitis arch support. Mixed reviews but I think some users are putting it on wrong. It fits around the ankle and the arch. Fits snugly but not painful. Feels good on my arch and I’ve only had it on for 20 minutes . It would be more helpful if the maker would show step by step instructions on proper positioning on the foot.
NEG 	I love that this is such an excellent space saver. It was fairly easy to put together. I highly recommend getting bigger anchors. Once the desk is completely put together it is very heavy and the anchors provided could not possibly hold it up. With the better anchors it came out great!
NEG 	iPad is dented in the top left corner and a hairline crack exists because of it. Good price, software works just fine.
NEG 	I use this product for my I phone 6s. A simple phone holder without many features I can easily change the angle, but the hold power is a little weak I think it's okay if you have a regular size phone
NEG 	Well organized inside but is almost too light. It scoots around while trying to install things.
NEG 	I really like this book. It has a lot of low-calorie and low-calorie recipes. The ketogenic diet is a very popular low-carb diet. The most important thing is that the cooking does not take more from me, it does not take a long time to stand by the stove. A lot of interesting recipes, I recommend reading.
NEG 	Attractive product and easy to use. I especially liked that it could be used on the forehead or in the ear. Accuracy is a bit off from reading to reading and when compared to results from an under-the-tongue thermometer but not significant enough for alarm.
NEG 	This is nice. Keeps the sun from burning my neck.
NEG 	I like it and using it every day.
NEG 	I enjoyed the book, it was a lot of news articles and reports out together, but it summed it all up & I enjoyed reading it. He was definitely a damaged individual!
NEG 	Comfy but after a while the memory foam is non-existent but they are still comfortable.
NEG 	This is a great lounger, however one end came without the little black stopper on one end. I am trying to see where I can get another....I can air it up, but it never has held air like the end with the small black thing.
NEG 	The sweater is adorable. Colors are vibrant and it washed well. I gave 4 stars because the overall size was fine but the hood is so tight, my son can't use it. (Still wears the sweater regularly).
NEG 	It's a little shorter than expected, but very nice and comfy.
NEG 	Gift for my Daughter
NEG 	I have a relatively small size head. I don't use these or headphones in general much so they'll do. The sound is great, battery is great, look is great. But they make my ears very sore. I put them on the end of an ironing board to stretch for a few days and that made them a little better but it is still not right. I like that they fold up too.
NEG 	This wreath was a great price and doesn't look cheap. The 17" was large enough on our front door. No quality issues.
NEG 	This works remarkably well. They were great on peaches, near perfect on plums. Very easy.
NEG 	It works properly. The wrist strap not exactly big enough.
NEG 	looks nice for an inexpensive pair.
NEG 	If there was an option to give this product a 4.5 stars I would as the screen protector isn't a perfect fit therefore there will be spots on the screen that is not covered. And that goes for both the top and bottom screen. I would also like to note that only the top protector is glass where as the bottom is plastic. Which is understandable and I don't mind. The glass protector is really nice, it's almost as if it wasn't there and it handles prettt well against finger prints. But the bottom one does not do so well against finger prints. It was also a bit difficult to put the protectors on as they aren't a perfect fit so you may have one corner more exposed than the other which may be a bit irritating.
NEG 	I would highly recommend this product.Nice and loud sound, and easy to operate.
NEG 	Excellent main character with integrity. Good read for fans of military and black ops fiction . I enjoyed the fair treatment of military from all branches and numerous wars. The true heroes are humble - this book was a good reminder
NEG 	Bought this for my off-roading needs as it was priced lesser than other brands. It appears to be of a good quality, waiting to be tested. However, find that the material is too stiff, perhaps it will become more flexible after a couple of uses.
NEG 	They are small paper filters. They come neatly stacked in a small box and they work just fine. Check on You Tube and you will find many uses for them other than coffee.
NEG 	Bought as a gift, the recipient liked it a lot. I'm not giving 5 starts because in one of the squares the wood was not smooth and was slightly peeling off.
NEG 	I should have measured the bags were a lot smaller than I thought. Good quality.
NEG 	This is a good addition to my office chair in my room. Although the material is very stiff and tough the best comparison to it is of a hard marshmallow. The memory foam is well made and works as it designed for. Its more comfortable than without it since my office chair is very uncomfortable and the cushion sucks so this is a great addition for my work space.
NEG 	Cute coat My dog doesn’t seem to like it however she appreciates it when I put it on her just to carry her to the car .. Other than that she just isn’t a coat dog and I think she finds it weird 😂😂
NEG 	My husband and I love these. Even our kids love them and use them for drinks.
NEG 	Skin and hair feels so good. Amazon never disappoints in its customer service.
NEG 	Solid harness, but it runs big! My 45lb lab mix fits in a small. I like the versatility of the front and back clips, plus the handle for extra safety.
NEG 	I can't blame the seller. The product probably works great. I didn't read the description and implicit warnings against removing the screen without being familiar with the procedure. I turned a $20 repair into a $200 repair because I tried to duplicate a display/touch screen repair off of YouTube, which apparently is a different, process than replacing just the glass and will wreck your display. I really wish it worked out for me and I could give 5 stars, but I didn't really get to use it. I'll give the seller some credit anyway.
NEG 	Nice colors and oil. Great that it’s environmentally friendly!
NEG 	A family fun Christmas and I ordered a couple of games. We used some of the trivia questions in some of our games, but many of the questions were difficult to answer
NEG 	It set up pretty easily
NEG 	Overall the book was very good. I loved the world and the characters the author created. I felt a few chapters dragged on just a bit, but overall I enjoyed the book very much.
NEG 	I found some old floppy disks with photos on them. Everyone I called about accessing those floppies basically laughed at me! For under $15 I got what I needed with this portable floppy disk drive and now I'm laughing too! Hahaha
NEG 	I used these to make vanilla extract. The product was not as flavorful as I expected, though I used the correct amount for making the extract.
NEG 	They were a little larger then I anticipated. Works great and easy to use. Necklaces can pull apart easily Rather than fighting with a tiny clasp.
NEG 	The wig itself is a beautiful unit and shipping was very quick. Unfortunately, I received the wrong color but I needed the wig for a wedding right away so I wasn't able to exchange.
NEG 	Fit to size just slightly smaller around the chest even with a binder
NEG 	This is super cute shirt. The material is well made. I have gotten many complaints.
NEG 	Love the look and fit - very light. Sound quality not great - but definitely good enough, especially for the great price. I would recommend and would buy again! K.B.
NEG 	I don't really like the handles, but the steel is excellent and will say that the steel far surpasses any other one I have used...
NEG 	Suspense, romance, drama, and strong characters. This book has everything. I will be looking forward to more from this author.
NEG 	Loved everything but the tassel banner. It was ok but was very time consuming to put together and wasn’t as neat as I thought it would be for the time put into it.
NEG 	this is for outdoors and we use it outdoors but it can be pretty windy at times and when it is this heater doesnt work very well.
NEG 	My daughter is about 55 pounds this bed is perfect for someone 130 pounds or less the bed wabbles a little bit, no matter how much it's tightened. The finish and style is great just fyi not for a growing child I would say 10 and under.
NEG 	It is a pretty good tea and the cost is not bad.
NEG 	I gave this item to a co-worker for her birthday. She loved it!
NEG 	Very nice cut and fit. Elastic waistband is medium high quality. Drawstring rope is somewhat useful. Overall it fits nice and would recommend to my fellow Amazon shoppers.
NEG 	not always is easy to use with some equipment.
NEG 	I haven't read the book yet
NEG 	This is SO convenient!!! I wish that it stuck out a little further but it is SO handy. The only thing difficult about it is since it is attached to my AC vent, sometimes it makes the phone too cold & I can't use the touch screen. It has also clipped my fingers a few times cause of the spring. That said, one of the best purchases I've made yet! Makes using my phone as GPS SO much easier.
NEG 	I like it. . I wish it smelled flowery, but the texture is good.
NEG 	Easy to work. Doesn’t properly track steps. Always put may too many. I can take 4 steps, looks back at it and it will say I took 10-12
NEG 	very nice texture but some colors was hard to peel not sure if it was my heart press but the cold did not adhere too well. Love the colors and was fast shipping.
NEG 	Makes hair stronger (therefore longer) and reduces breakage, but can be a little heavy for fine and/or thin hair.
NEG 	Arrived well packed and undamaged. We have only been out one weekend depending on this battery to power our travel trailer but it powered everything we needed, including a small 12v fan at night, with very little power loss, it performed beyond our expectations!
NEG 	So let me start by saying, i’m a registered nurse and i’m just now getting into & researching essential oils; got this book and immediately started processing my return 😂. it is VERY much so a scientific TEXTBOOK and could be overwhelming to most people. I ended up keeping the book because i figured out HOW to use it. Each essential oil has a section that tells about multiple case studies and cautions. THIS is valuable because it allows me to make an informed decision on how much of the oil is safe to use and not to use; because some oils for kids are considered unsafe (eucalyptus as an example) and by me seeing in the studies that the ppl or kids that had a negative reaction LIKELY orally consumed a large amount of it or was exposed to too high of a concentration. So for this purpose it is helpful!
NEG 	Maybe it is the case with all these shutter releases, but they seem to come unscrewed fairly easily and fall off. That said, they are well built and comfortable to use. No sharp edges and they add a little bling to the camera.
NEG 	Very easy to adjust the the height and the display area.
NEG 	I feel like the ending was rushed and missed so much! The story was written well and I loved the characters but it seemed to fall apart at the end. I guess I'll have to get over it though as there is no fourth book in a trilogy!
NEG 	Boils water! It is pretty loud when boiling though. Not a whistle just a loud droning sound.
NEG 	Smell is not that strong at all I have 4 plugged in thru out the home and I can barely tell it
NEG 	To charge up the ash tray you need a very bright light for 45 min so it will glow(more then your phone light) and works as expected.
NEG 	The color is great, Rose Gold. I am replacing one in Black that I had for about 2 years. The edge chipped when it was dropped. But considering the price and how long it did last, I am repurchasing this product and would recommend it.
NEG 	4 stars instead of 5... I really like it but it could have some stellar improvements. The phone case is detachable. It has a good magnet. The color and feel is great. The edging of the phone case is a bit rough. The wallet portion has 10 slots for IDs/cards, but if you fill them all it’s to tight to get cards out and the wallet does not close as it should. It has some design flaws but overall I see myself using this for a while.
NEG 	The color looks natural and has covered the few grays at my temple better and longer than any color I have tried so far. I have had compliments on it's color and the conditioner leaves it feeling like silk. Easy to apply, even for an amateur like me. No burning or horrible smell. I have paid a lot more for not as satisfactory results.
NEG 	Work as intended and havnt broken yet
NEG 	i highly recommend this book, he doesn't hold anything back, very interesting and the price could not be beat
NEG 	I have large breasts and needed a simple, comfortable bra for sleeping and breastfeeding. I wear a 38DD normally and I cannot even imagine how huge my chest actually wa lbs after giving birth. BIG. These are comfortable though not ultra supportive for a huge load. Additionally, for sleeping, if you sleep sideways, your boobs will fall out of them (again, if you have a very large chest). I had to manually sew them. They weren’t bad for the price.
NEG 	Easy to spot. No problems with it so far! Only wish it had 360 wheels for functionality.
NEG 	This is a good product but if it had adjustable straps beneath the ears, as shown in the picture, it would be more comfortable. Even so, this helmet will do the job.
NEG 	I bought this to take to a rummage sale held by an animal rescue organization where I volunteer. The only problem I had was trying to feed thin paper tape into it but finally figured it out. Calculator held up perfectly through 3 days of a busy checkout. Very happy with purchase and the fact that this machine is compact.
NEG 	It did what I needed it to do
NEG 	Very sequined which is exactly what I wanted! I am 123 lbs. and 5'6, that being said it was rather short for my liking. I have longer legs so maybe that was the issue. I will be another one in M to see how the fit is, but overall great quality and the sequins seem to be holding up nicely.
NEG 	the seller of this product is true to their word, it is what they say it is. Simple but Great.
NEG 	i purchased this just in case i decide i want to forfeit being natural
NEG 	only had on drain hole in the center. Need more than one hole. this unit looks great and will accomodate many plants. I like this product.
NEG 	Looks great. Good quality. Good price compared to others on the internet.
NEG 	Loved the combo, my daughter of 10 loved them, but the mermaids peeled off quite fast, but overall craftsmanship was great!! I would recommend!!
NEG 	I put them in my garden to help keep birds away and hopefully help with the moles, also. I put some in my flowerbed just to brighten it up. I haven't had the pinwheels long enough to see if they will hold up in the weather.
NEG 	My knives were in desperate need of sharpening! This is so light weight and easy to use! Definitely a good buy!
NEG 	Fast moving story felt like there was more he could have included.
NEG 	I consider myself an Old lady at heart. I love comfy sweaters, tea, knitting, all the good things in life. I'm also a bit of a spooky old goth, who didn't really own any "goth" sweaters until now. This sweater fits perfectly. Its cozy. Its cute. I've gotten SO many compliments on it! I wish it had pockets, but you can't win them all. ;) Definitely a great buy! It arrived pretty quickly too.
NEG 	got based on friends input, it really works and quick to apply, light weight.
NEG 	I purchased 4 of these and one was damaged but still works(hopefully this won't affect the life of it). Not sure about the battery life yet. They seem to be made well.
NEG 	The bumper was excellent fit and finish pretty darn close to factory. Difference that I noticed We’re Toyota badgers and tow rating. Gauge of Metal was exactly same as Toyota original equipment
NEG 	So good to see something good about the best county in the world.
NEG 	So nice not to have to tie up laces. The fit was just right.
NEG 	I use these with camping to keep water at the campsite. They pack well and hold up well but they are prone to getting holes so don't rely on just one.
NEG 	It worked and was easy to operate.
NEG 	Don't like that it has a place for coins
NEG 	My lamp came, and I was very excited to use it. I unboxed it, and followed the directions for installation. I had trouble getting both side to turn no, but eventually figured it out. Operator error. Looks good now.
NEG 	Not enough support for me but I will still wear them.
NEG 	Packaging was great. Roses are still going strong!! The white flowers are dying quick
NEG 	just me/afraid i'll break it/sm
NEG 	While this fits my apple keyboard perfectly, I find that it's actually cumbersome to type on. My finger tips aren't large, but they feel very clumsy while typing, almost as if the protective cover has a grabby type feel to it. That being said, it has performed it's job admirably, as I am clumsy around the computer and often spill, splash liquids of all sorts on the keyboard. Underneath, the apple keyboard is white as snow.
NEG 	Versatile phone mount, especially if you can't use vent clips. Even if you can, it doesn't block a vent (which is nice!)
NEG 	Another good product
NEG 	Very comfortable, recommended!
NEG 	Nice ink and bright light. I wish intensity could be adjusted dimmer, so not to wake spouse.
NEG 	Product took a while to be delivered. This may have been due other items from different sources combined with this one in the shippment. Instructions were not the easiest to follow but with multiple video sources and repetitive trial and error I got it done. All heads were clogged. Persistence yielded success.
NEG 	Excellent card, came like new condition. Wish it was foil, but that’s not worth the $15 extra
NEG 	2 out of the 3 cables stopped working after a day of use. Initially I got the "accessory not supported" alert but after that I did not even see that message. I am returning the item immediately. Update : Seller contacted me and offered to ship me a new set free of cost. Impressed by customer service and will wait to see how the replacement parts perform
NEG 	Pretty thin but I will love in the summer with flip flops ...
NEG 	But they're all rescues, happy to not be earing garbage and road kill. I will say it has helped with weight control with 2 of 3 dogs, the third is a chow hound who can beat dropped food to the floor.
NEG 	I absolutely fell in love with Owen and Becca and loved joining them on their journey ... Can't wait for Teddy and Sara's story
NEG 	MY SON LOVES IT. ONLY REASON DID NOT GIVE 5 STARS IS THE LUNCHBOX IS SMALLER THAN EXPECTED AND THE POCKETS ON SIDE OF LUNCH BOX AND BACKPACK ARE VERY SMALL. DIFFICULT TO FIT THERMOS OR SNACKS IN THE SIDE POCKETS. IF THAT IS NOT CONCERN THEN THIS IS PERFECT... ITS GREAT DEAL REGARDLESS.
NEG 	Writing a review for this bag is kind of hard. One reason why, I love this bag. But why put in that smell in the bag? Ever since I purchased this bag, it has never left the plastic smell! And another reason I dislike the bag, the folding never goes away. Don’t know how to stop it from folding. Other than those problems it’s a great bag to begin with.
NEG 	I think this holds hair better than the white hair nets we bought, this one has more cling. I think it does keep hair out
NEG 	I know this is a re-issue so there were updates to the design but the eyes are a bit scary actually.
NEG 	It took me most of the day, but in the end it's sturdy and useful. We use the pull-up top a lot.
NEG 	Nice product, good value for the money. Some of the pieces are cracked though still useable.
NEG 	Love to hear these live
NEG 	So it works. It's a battery.
NEG 	I am still enjoying this series. But I don't see a world where I would take my son a thousand miles to Chicago to try and rescue my estranged wife (or even non estranged) from the military. And if the shoe was on the other foot I wouldn't want my wife to come and try and rescue me from the military, and especially not put our child at risk to do so. Aside from that fairly major plot problem, the book is still good.
NEG 	The only problems I have with this product are: 1. I had to call the company and separately order the decals. 2. You must own a drill to put this together. Even though the directions say to use a Phillips head screwdriver. There is no way I would have been able to put his together properly without a drill. Other than those two things, I am completely happy with his product and my child absolutely adores it.
NEG 	I enjoyed the romance between Elizabeth and her Duke. I also am waiting to see what happens between Claire and Richie. This is a great series.
NEG 	Good product. A little difficult to install but does the job.
NEG 	Only 4 starts becsuse I haven't use them yet...waiting for my cruise trip in summer. So far I'm happy with the product look like a great value and quality.
NEG 	I bought the yellow lid for my 6-quart and the clear/transparent one for my 8-quart IP Duo Plus. They both seal the inner pot well. While the clear one is easy to put on and take off, I cannot say the same with the yellow one. A little effort is required to get it on and off your inner pot. It’s also way thicker and heavier even though it’s smaller of the two.
NEG 	Pros: tracks steps; shows text messages (if you enable the feature through the app); extremely easy setup with the app; looks quite similar to a Fitbit Cons: so very difficult to remove the bands to change the device (my fingers are still sore a day later); I ordered the blue band because in the color it looks like a blueish-grey, unfortunately it’s just blue; the texts aren’t easy to read because the screen is so narrow and long. Bottom line- if you want this as a very inexpensive alternative to a Fitbit and aren’t worried about it being easy to read texts, then this is the device for you. I really just wanted something to track my steps because it’s easier to wear this than carry my phone everywhere. The difficulty of removing the bands though is pretty tough for me to get past and I don’t look forward to having to do it again. I have a feeling I will break it at some point which will render the device useless.
NEG 	Product is an exact match for the OEM part. Have not installed it yet but will soon, so no performance information yet.
NEG 	We LOVE these head wraps! Our little Zoe is 16 months and they fit perfectly on her with room to grow. They are so cute I even use them in photos for marketing my business relating to cute babies, pregnancy, motherhood inspiration, etc. She hates wearing most things on her head but these are SOOO soft and comfy that she will keep them on. Love these for summer weather (not too hot) and they could be useful in other seasons. Whether it’s just a day I don’t have to do hair or a day we just want to change up the look, we love them! And the colors are vibrant as well. The only thing I saw was a little glue on a couple of the hats where the tie area is. Otherwise, Great product!
NEG 	Its like the OtterBox Defender without a screen protector built into the case. If you get the Turquoise, its actaully somewhat more Teal. Very comfortable to hold, but its a hastle to get out of your pocket.
NEG 	Worked for our wedding
NEG 	it arrived early which is a big plus. however it isn’t quite like the picture. instead of being straight the pieces in between the stars are curved and not in all the same direction.
NEG 	The lights are great. Gave my truck a great modern look. But the low beam pattern needs to be adjusted.
NEG 	Purchased for my husband who has issues with walking. Works great, but a little too slow for me. His doctor said this was a great idea to build up leg muscles.
NEG 	First and foremost, this is not a paid review, promotional review, or anything of the sort. I am purely doing this review to let others know about this product along with many others out there that have gave a similar review. With that in mind let me tell you all about these sweet pair of headphones. These are my first "noise cancelling" headphones and I say it like that because they only really cancel some sounds, not all. Now I have tried on other headsets, such as Sony or Bose, but after further review I want something that was cheaper for the time being that were comfortable, have a long battery life, and crisp sound/good bass. After first turning them on I did have that initial sound that was crackling but after one song it went away, however I haven't had them long so if it is consist I'll add a edit later. Anyway, these are a fairly solid pair of wireless ANC headphones if your on a budget or don't care about brand recognition. TaoTronics have some fairly solid other products too but this is the only one I have truly tried out. Pros: Battery life, anything that I don't have to charge once a day and more life once a week is a major win in my book and on top of that the charge time is fairly quick as far as my experience as seen with it so far. Comfort, I can quickly tell that these won't hurt after several hours of wearing them. You might get some mild discomfort/ear sweat if you have them on and it's hot out but other then that nothing so far for me. Price, enough said. Cons: Not a recognized brand? Some people are seriously loyal to their brands and will buy any amount of money. ANC isn't as good as others but still works well enough. With that it is also worth mentioning that they will work good on trains or airplanes as long as you have something playing with it. You might still pick up some sounds but for the most part they are pretty solid.
NEG 	Very cute, doesn’t adjust to different sizes.
NEG 	My husband is very please with this shirt.
NEG 	Works good most of the time, but as with all things with suction cups, they don't last more than a year or so at best.
NEG 	I got this backpack for my 8 year old daughter. If you want it for traveling it’s perfect (good material, several divisions and pockets). I got it for Elementary school and it is too big for my daughter to handle, specially when getting in or out of the car.
NEG 	Great Buy wish they made it a little more sturdier in the frame frame
NEG 	The curtain itself is nice and looks great, the holding rings are pretty cheap and flimsy, not to mention don't snap in so retention is a problem, you might want to look into purchasing some quality show rings alongside this.
NEG 	I love it! Great quality and weight.
NEG 	It was exceptionally enlightening being new to Keto Dieting I have discovered what I can do extraordinary and have now lost 15 lbs since I have been following the bearings in the book. I loved the formulas inside and even attempted a couple. They were astonishing.
NEG 	I love these sheets! It seems I should order king size for my queen size bed but the quality is amazing for the price!
NEG 	This is a nice toy, for the $, wish it did a little bit more but son still loves it. Will outgrow soon only drawback!
NEG 	Product is smaller than expected for the price. Very cute tabletop decoration but not for the price.
NEG 	did not like trying to fill base with wet sand....other than that its attractive and looks great with the furniture on our patio
NEG 	Great trailer, bitch to assemble. And that's due to CRAPPY, nearly-useless directions. I had to do a google search to find out how to connect it to my bike because it WASN'T IN THE "DIRECTIONS" so-called. That's my only complaint but it's a big one.
NEG 	One of the suction cups will not stick by other than that the product is great
NEG 	This dress is nice and light, flowy, and soft. Perfect for warm summer days. I only wish that this came in an x-small as my usual size, a small, fit a little more loose than I would like.
NEG 	Sin and Archer very nice read. I enjoyed their story with supporting characters that rounded out the story. Nice and sweet.
NEG 	Handy little device. Except, where the lights are connected they tend to droop. But for the price, I'm not complaining
NEG 	Says firm compression. More like medium. Otherwise, as described.
NEG 	Protects the screen well. Cracks pretty easily compared to other protectors, but it much cheaper.
NEG 	Fast delivery, pretty band. Stiff for leather but softening up
NEG 	Great curtains! I ordered two and one is about half an in shorter then the other unfortunately. Other than that they look wonderful!
NEG 	Cups do not leak and our 2-year old seems to have no trouble drinking from them, but the graphics wore off in about a month. We hand wash everything, so there's not even a dishwasher to blame.
NEG 	First attempt to wax a canvas item so started with my favorite hat. Once you fine-tune the amount of heated wax to apply, the process was simple. Hair dryer was useful tool to help reheat the wax after application to smooth out areas of application. Full water proofing. Worked like a charm!
NEG 	Gets the job done. No issues after a month of daily use.
NEG 	This is a very colorful decoration and looks nice in my tank.
NEG 	Fits as expected keeps everything smooth and tight
NEG 	I really like that the remote parts match the colors of the original Nintendo switch and the little leg is open so we can use it with it. I would love if it was shockproof. I’d need more time to be able to test it and give it 5 stars. I definetly recomend this purchase.
NEG 	I received mine today was a surprise for my husband for our anniversary, but it was 1 size too big. Im so upset have to send back and order a another one and wait. Ugh instead of. 9.5 i need a 9 which is the size he wears. Dau was ruined.
NEG 	Overall very satisfied. Our only concern is that one connecting component wouldn’t insert fully, so it’s slightly crooked. The gate still works well and is sturdy and secure.
NEG 	Grandkids and myself had an awesome time with these! Good craft!
NEG 	Bought these for my 17 year old Jack Russell, he was having a hard time walking around on my wood floors, they help him, only down fall is they will fall off
NEG 	They were a very food size.
NEG 	This worked well for 4-5 months before something broke internally, it got quite loud and battery life dropped by half. Customer service was helpful and sent a replacement after a brief exchange. The new one works well. I withheld one star due to the first one breaking. Hopefully the second one will last longer. My house is mostly hard surfaces, but with a number of oriental rugs. I was worried about the rugs and their tassels, but it's rarely an issue. Occasionally it will get tangled in a tassel but I can free it without damage to the rug or Eufy. The vacuum works really well and my house is cleaner now than it was before.
NEG 	The battery arrived and looked as described and was a great value for the money. The only issue encountered was the terminal used to connect the battery to the iPhone was slightly longer than the original equipment battery. I had to make a slight bend in the battery’s terminal post to ensure a proper fit.
NEG 	I bought this phone to be used in the Caribbean I unboxed it and all seems well and In place.. the charge on battery was 60% which I think is usual for battery float voltage which was on the shelf for a while. I will update this review in terms of performance in a couple of weeks when the phone is placed on local network .
NEG 	My dog loves this food but very expensive
NEG 	shipping took forever but it was worth it
NEG 	I'm glad these are good for the environment and they work okay but they don't work as well as the ones that are cheaper and bad for the environment. Sigh.
NEG 	Sturdy and looks great. I like the brown leather color. The handgrip for holding the iPad is elastic and very flimsy. The 12.9” iPad plus this case = heavy. This hand slot does not give a confident grip on the iPad. Otherwise, I like the look and the stand function very well. Happy with the purchase.
NEG 	I liked this book a lot. It was cool how there was a book within the book, but at first it was confusing because the format wasn’t clear. But it was a fun mystery!
NEG 	Fit perfectly just after opening the package it felt used or something. The materials stitching was coming up so I can feel little bumps under my hand can be distracting when your holding the wheel. But I can probably cut them off and be ok.
NEG 	Overall nice sweater, however stitching is a little off.
NEG 	It's hard to know how many stars to give this product because 1) on the one hand, it stopped working less than a month after I received it, but 2) the company honored its warranty and sent me a brand new one with no trouble at all. I just received the new one, and I really hope it has a much longer working life span than the first one I received last month!
NEG 	Dogs love it, durable, made in USA. The only drawback is paying $20 for a dog ball. That is a little crazy to me, but there are really no suitable alternatives.
NEG 	It was sad to leave these characters & this world but the ending was really good . It was complete with nothing left undone . The only problem I had was close to the ending when they went from planning to battle . It just felt to me that a chapter was missing . Still recommend because I loved it very much
NEG 	This is a great cost effective product to help my team be more productive and efficent at work. The only problem they on communicate with their own radios. They are not compatible with other radios like Cobra .
NEG 	This is a beautiful top and is exactly as pictured. I liked it so much I ended up ordering it in two more colors after I received the first one. The only important thing to know is that it is extremely delicate and for that reason I’m worried that it won’t last through many wears. The front part are two very thin and delicate pieces of lace that are seen together and I can absolutely imagine it tearing, Snagging or unraveling. That being said I have washed this shirt in the regular wash and left it to hang dry and that worked really well with no issues.
NEG 	Needed to cut to fit in car
NEG 	The watch looked and felt great on. I have big wrists and the band fit without any problems. After wearing the watch for about a week one of the number marks fell off and now it rolls around inside and makes noise. The watch itself still works but hearing the clinging noise is annoying.
NEG 	Love my new bands, comfortable to wear.
NEG 	Little expensive. Strong smell.
NEG 	Good--Much brighter than the incandescent microwave lights Meh--flickers slightly on low and doesn't actually turn off. Not a big deal we use it as a night light for the kitchen.
NEG 	the colors are great for day and evening wear
NEG 	I bought both front and rear flip open covers. I gave it only a 4 star because of the rubber part. Don't know or feel it will last long term... we'll see. These are Trijicon specific... meaning they are from and for Trijicon. Which I wad glade to see. Dont believe they will work on another manufacturers scope. They are made of rubber and plastic. The door/cover is plastic... and the mount to scope is somewhat a stretch fit. It is tight when installed and you must align the holes onto scope. Protecting your weapons sight lenses are important... you know why, especially Trijicon's they don't run cheep.
NEG 	Case is great and really thin. Had it on for about a week, and no scratches on the back.. Pretty durable. Not sure about doing a drop test on this, but gives very limited protection, as expected (it being so thin). All buttons are accessible and no issues. Thank you.
NEG 	Ordered up for my rib cage and down a cup size. I'm typically a 36ddd but thanks to other reviews ordered a 38dd and glad I did! Fits great and will keep things where they are supposed to be!
NEG 	Such a sweet book about Beth and her journey as a wife and mother. It’s a relatable book but probably a better read if you are familiar with her and her work.
NEG 	Perfect addition to my corner desk. My only problem is that you can see the screws which is the reason for my 4 stars. If they had covers or anything to hide them it would be perfect. It took me 6 minutes to put together with a screw gun. You can do it with a screwdriver but it will be double or triple the time.
NEG 	Well I just received it today, and have not used it yet, so I cannot say yet about the ease and durability. Will have to update my review after using. It was very nicely packaged and all items in great shape. Worth the money for what I got. I contacted seller because I was not receiving it. He was very helpful! The problem was with Amazon and not the seller. For some reason Amazon lost the processing of my order or the order itself. I contacted them, and the lady told me once she solved the problem she would put a rush 2 day free shipping on the package. Well I got it today, yet I was still charged the standard shipping. Not sure why this order was so complicated? But I do thank the seller for his help and understanding. Very happy with him, not so much with Amazon.
NEG 	The style was great, but fit runs small. I wish it had fit. It was exactly the style I was going for. I was very disappointed I couldn't reorder in a larger size. :-(
NEG 	It was a cute story.
NEG 	It fits our 36 in tall and 26 pound 3 yr old. It is slightly low cut in the front for a toddler leotard.
NEG 	Great book and gets your attention from the start. I love all the twist throughout, making it hard to put down.
NEG 	Loved the way they fit and looked
NEG 	Great little swing arm bag. Big enough to hold all the pertinent papers and a few little things. Only marked down because you have to have the bolts exposed inside the bag and that's caused a drink I was carrying to pop, soaking everything inside the bag. Tape up the sharp edges of the bolts and you should be good.
NEG 	you have to make sure the zipper is in the correct direction or you end up not locking the bag. However, when you get used to that it is good.
NEG 	Typical made in China, a bit sloppy on the covering but otherwise fine. Too small and lightly padded for big people, over 200 pounds. Fine for me and it works well. You need some basic skills to properly assemble it. The product came with 10 washers but the packing list says 8, which is correct. If you are tempted to put washers under the casters, don't, that will weaken them. One washer on each side of the 4 bolts is correct.
NEG 	This is a good history of the Cherokee Indian Nation from about the mid 1700's until just after the Civil War. It basically follows the Ridge family line starting with "Major" Ridge. This book is just not about the Trail of Tears. That is not covered until last quarter of the book. This book does give good detail of how the removal came to be and all the ones that were involved in it. It is very good on that standpoint. This should be required studies for all. It is a very bad period of our history that came at the same time the slave issue was being debated very much. It is hard to understand what people were thinking then but it was a very different time and hopefully we have progressed some in America. The reasons I only give it four stars is that much is quoted at length in this book. Much of it could have been summed up in a more concise way to make it more easily understandable. Some of it could have been left out too. Also I think more could have been devoted to the trail. The author seemed to start on good path with it but sort of broke it off suddenly. But still a very good book if you want to gain a good understanding of this terrible episode in American history.
NEG 	Fun card game, chances are you’ll either know the clue or you won’t but it’s an easier almost trivia-like game based in popular culture
NEG 	Very strong for it's test. More memory then I like. Dissapears well
NEG 	Cute but runs a tad bit small and short for how I like my T-shirt’s
NEG 	I returned this because it was too small for my berry leggy dog. I thought it would be nice to be able to expand the case during layovers but she’s still too tall and needs a larger case. When zipped closed the pet carrier feels sturdy. I don’t know how durable the mesh is when expanded. Only complaint is that when closed the expandable mesh takes up some of the space inside. Best for smaller breeds.
NEG 	Really handy thermometer. Probe started reading ten degrees too high, I contacted customer service and they are sending me another probe. Very quick response.
NEG 	I received my stones and they are Great!! The only issue i have is I didn't receive a fluorite stone, but did get 2 Amethyst stones. But overall satisfied.
NEG 	The fit is perfect for my watch 24mm. The pins should be a litter thicker. Please make pins thicker. With more colors.
NEG 	My son really enjoyed these books great quality will definitely buy again
NEG 	I thought the fake leather would look more like leather but it doesn’t look much like anything. It’s a nice case for the money and I am glad I purchased it.
NEG 	Awesome gift, sadly one came broken, but i would purchase from these folks again
NEG 	Pros: The protective frame is excellent. Top notch design and protection. I'm no longer in danger of smashing my controllers to bits on my basement cement wall. Cons: The silicone protective case for is a bad design. The design doesn't integrate with the protective frame so it doesn't anchor well and just slips off of the handle over time. That's OK thought. Just don't use it.
NEG 	Definitely doesn't last as long as I had hoped, but I am not perfectly measuring out 1 loads worth of detergent. I just eyeball it. The bags are a little clumsy to pour, so make sure you do it over a sink and with two hands and you'll be fine. Smells good, and gets the job done. I pair it with oxyclean and it gets out any and all stains.
NEG 	I like this product. A little pricey.
NEG 	The AT Large book was a little too violent, but still very good. Bay and Once were 5 stars all the way. Good character development, action, and no wasted words.
NEG 	i got this for just extend the wifi. and it does good job.
NEG 	Complex story; kept my attention. Ut lots of characters and lineage to track Some of this situations were too coincidental.
NEG 	The first one was detected but they were kind enough to send me another one free of charge
NEG 	Starts slow compared to the first book in the series. However it picks up the pace about 1/3 of the way in. Very well thought out plot just takes a little longer to get there.
NEG 	Glad this style was available in my size at Amazon. Unable to find locally and these have been my fave yearly flops forever.
NEG 	I tried most of the film protectors for the Note 9 and these are about the best. They do attract finger prints and oil but they all do. The pen marks go away for the most part and these are case friendly. I had two defects, one had debris under it and the other had what looked like a dried bubble during the manufacture process. DeltaShield replace them no problem so I really can't complain much. Even so I can't give a 5 star for that but I would purchase them again if needed. Over all I'm satisfied.
NEG 	Some times the screen gets a little foggy and hard to read.
NEG 	It's not bad. I prefer light roast or breakfast blends. But I'll drink about anything. I like my coffee to taste like coffee and not lightly flavored water. You have to use extra scoops of this to make it have flavor. I never thought coffee grounds could be TOO light. My husband likes it. And needing the extra scoop kinda lowers the value of this. Which is why I bought it in the first place.
NEG 	I was stunned by this book held my interest throughout. The relationship between the two lead female characters was an unexpected, but welcome development. Although I received the book from instant freebies, I highly recommend it. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.
NEG 	For followers of Oak Island it is the perfect gift.
NEG 	They are easy to work with
NEG 	The length and quality of the cord are fantastic (so far anyway, I haven't had it more than a couple months.) I love the fact that orientation of the connector to the cable is no worry. The problem comes from the size of the plug that goes into the device; it's too large for most phones with cases, and will probably require modifying the case on most tablets. That being said, it's worth it if you use it with a device that you tend to use while it's charging; it will save your charging port in the long run.
NEG 	I love love the Masters of Shadowlands series! I got to see Master Z outside the club. He's this warm, caring and loving dad. Once in a while his dominance comes out and I just swoon! It's definitely a change from the other books but still has the excitement and love!
NEG 	Slightly larger than I hoped for although the handle folds and it fits nicely into my vanity drawer. Powerful dryer for its size. The cord is long enough to use easily.
NEG 	I love this product! Unfortunately they sent me the wrong kind on my last order. I paid extra for one day shipping as well. I am hopefully that someone will contact me in order to fix their mistake.
NEG 	I found this has the most satisfying and authentic taste for use in cooking, and the price makes it good for saving against the purchase of many smaller containers if you use it enough. If you don't use it that much, you're better off forking out more per ounce on a smaller size.
NEG 	I picked this high chair for it's slim design because we live in a condo and we're limited on space. I wasn't a fan of the plastic piece under the tray that goes in between baby's legs, but my husband saw it was attached with screws, so he removed it. Simple as that, for anyone who doesn't like that feature. I like that the material used on the high chair is designed to be wiped down easily, but at times I wish I could take the whole thing off and throw it in the washing machine. It wasn't easy to do that so I left the cover on, but removed the straps to be washed (baby kept gnawing on straps and getting food on them). I love that the basket type feature under the seat is there because that's where I keep the bibs. My favorite feature is that it only takes one hand to pull on the strap in the seat to close the high chair for storage. Kudos to whoever thought of that idea!
NEG 	Be warned - if you need to use this for a cup or bottle with a handle, it won’t fit. For a water bottle, it’s great. For a travel cup with handle, look elsewhere.
NEG 	At first I was really excited about this find. It looks sleek and nice. It fits under cabinet fine. But when lifting the head, it hits the wall, so it has to be pulled out some, wouldn’t be a big deal, but the awesome thing that keeps it from bouncing around(suction cups on the bottom), makes it a bit of an ordeal. But easily ignored. The one thing I am very disappointed about, everytime I use it, is how far the mixing tools(paddle and whisk) are from the actual bowl. Easily 1/4 of an inch away. It makes the mixture leave a layer of mix against the bowl, never to be touched by the mixing tools. So it HAS to be turned off and sides scraped, multiple times during use. Way past the time to send back, and is better than having nothing. However, I would look for one that has the mixing tool much closer to the edges of the bowl, so you really can leaving it mixing to itself.
NEG 	We really like the quality of this trimmer, and it does an excellent job trimming around the fence line, shrubs, and our many trees. My only issue is that it is a bit on the heavy side; which is caused by the battery weight and the fact that greenworks built it to last. Very easy to change an attachment.
NEG 	This product is as advertised. Gloves fit well and feel well made
NEG 	Ok, so I just received them and not had a chance to use them extensively. From little use, they are sharp and cut very well. They are comfortable and the size if was looking for. I own a pair of Felco pruners for slightly larger work. These are perfect for fine pruning of my flowers.
NEG 	Needed a new rug for my apartment and liked the style of this one. Everyone commented on how soft it was and how the edges stayed down, and I would agree. My only complaint is it’s pretty thin, but it has held up well.
NEG 	This is my first tempered glass screen protector for any device. I’ve worked for AT&T and Apple and several of my customers always had tempered glass screen protectors. I was always afraid to use them because I didn’t know how easy it would be to get them off. I decided to get one because this is just too expensive to have a simple film. It was fairly easy to put on, but getting the dust off is a pain. That’s not a detractor for this protector, though. The reason I’m only giving this four stars is because I think tempered glass screen protectors are a gimmick after my first experience with them. I think it’s lovely that they give you to just in case one breaks or you make a mistake. However, because I didn’t make a mistake, I took off the first one and put on the second. In doing so, the first one slid off the couch and fell to the tile at a distance of about 2 feet. When I say it fell, I actually mean it gently glided down to the floor. When I went to clean up the mess from all of the paper, plastic, and cleaning supplies, I noticed that the first screen protector was completely shattered. There are many reviews saying that this screen protector saves the device, prevented it from shattering, etc. I don’t buy it. If it shattered from a height of 2 feet, then it really seems unnecessary for the purpose of protecting your screen from shattering. It will definitely protect against scratches, but that is the only reason that I would purchase this.
NEG 	I love this pink sweater it is perfect for the upcoming sweater season and is such a pretty pink!
NEG 	This story starts off hitting the ground running and never let's up. The characters are both strong and vividly portrayed. The general plot line was fun. The unbalanced focus on the supporting characters was confusing, especially since the character in the next book wasn't really talked about in this one. I also appreciate the happy ending and lack of cliffhangers. My two negatives would be the poor editing (if there even was an editor, many times articles are missing from sentences and words are repeated, although typos are minimal). Also the last ten percent of the book on my kindle was the next book sample, not the story itself.
NEG 	Love this product. I purchased about 12 and two of them didn't latch properly.
NEG 	Makes you think for sure.
NEG 	These are a great set of pens. Glitter gel pens are fun to color the adult books with. Keeps my hands busy. Washes out good in laundry too.
NEG 	This thing is small like others have said. It's also REALLY bright!!! So bright in fact when I have the alarm clock placed around two feet away on my nightstand I can close my eyes and enjoy the nice glow through my eye lids. I'm currently on the hunt for a small strip of 5% window tint to tone the thing down some. Who ever thought you would have to tint an alarm clock!?!?!?!?!? For the price it's not bad. As for the brightness..........not so much. OH!!! It also only has one volume to it which isn't adjustable and the alarm itself sounds like a cheap kitchen timer going off.
NEG 	Was a little difficult to get it properly "centered" on watch face.
NEG 	The bulbs work great but are the super bright color
NEG 	Work fine shipping was as much as item
NEG 	I rather like the unique design of this bookcase and it's sturdy as hell. Be aware, though, the screwdriver that comes with it is somehow weaker than the screws (which are, themselves, robust). I got about halfway through before the head of the screwdriver wore down too much to continue. As long as you have a decent extra lying around, you'll be fine.
NEG 	Good product. The squares are a little smaller than I am accustomed to, but I have managed. I should have taken the time to implement the measurements given.
NEG 	I ordered the Midnight Black backpack but they sent a gray one. The prodcut itself seems good quality but 4 stars--I'd give it 5 if they had sent the one I wanted.
NEG 	Used these for my chickens. Worked perfectly
NEG 	The material is smooth when touching it ! looks sturdy and beautiful ! The quality is decent . I Hope that clamp was a little bit better designed just to match the mount or something.. idk but overall it's a good item and i'm happy with it.
NEG 	Love my new honey dispenser!! Works great for drizzling a steady small stream,continuously over baked goods! Easy to fill,just place a pinky finger over hole. Dissapointed lid was plastic.Concerned the plastic may not last,doesn't seem durable. Chrome plated is false,just paint! Better if metal,more durable,would have paid extra for metal. Bought because it was glass not plastic!
NEG 	I really like the elastic band that comes with these pom poms, I wasn't overly happy with the quality of them. I was able to fluff them up a bit, but when I purchased a second order of them their was a definite difference in fluffiness between the first and second order. But they do work great for hats if that is what you are looking to buy them for. They are easily attachable. DO NOT WASH. Had a sister throw it in the washer by accident and the thing looked like a cotton ball! Whoops!
NEG 	A little thin as others have suggested. But good for cool fall days.
NEG 	The setting procedure is easy. Seem sturdy and work very well.
NEG 	Works pretty well but needs a good amount of muscle. You must hold it with both hands and twist. It is heaver and harder to use then I thought
NEG 	Very nice but the only problem is that the cut around the stickers is white, is not cut with the shape of each sticker. With the picture you can understand better.
NEG 	Not all the bags had the salt in them
NEG 	Love this rack. Especially in the heat and with summer swim clothes and towels, keeps my front porch free of mess. I use it to dry clothes and also to hang hubby and sons sweaty workout clothes to dry before they go in the laundry. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars was because on one side, the arm that is supposed to raise for hanging was attached on the wrong side, so it just falls if you put anything on it to hang since it can’t rest against the rungs. I tried to see if it could be unscrewed and adjusted to match the other side, but it has odd screws that are double sided. So, I can’t use that side for that purpose. But otherwise, it has amazing capacity!!
NEG 	It's very delicious but had a rather runny consistency compared to a calorie packed caramel dip. That's the sacrifice for calorie-free though, so can't complain too much!!
NEG 	Unfortunately, I didn't realize how many I ordered. I now have hangars coming out of every closet and will need to donate some the first opportunity I get.
NEG 	It's good but honestly there are much cheaper and better. I used Eco Complete and organic soil. Tried these for the look mostly
NEG 	Good fit, nice material, excellent buy.
NEG 	Not a real antique but it works for me
NEG 	Love the cat food! Unfortunately a good portion of cans were dented.
NEG 	Well built. Worked as promised.
NEG 	Larger than expected, difficult if right handed but manageable.
NEG 	Sunbrella for desert summers! Very nice, gets compliments, inexpensive but well made and functional.
NEG 	Super cute T; sizing is a little big
NEG 	Smaller than I thought it would be but fits nicely in the flowerbed. I like the little hook to put a small hanging plant or lantern. Sturdy and very cute and unique
NEG 	Awesome blanket. Great price. I definitely recommend. Appears as expected. Bright and bold colors. I woukd give five stars, but I will save the extra one for the real top shelf stuff.
NEG 	I ordered this to wear after having a baby (before losing my weight) and am very happy! (I've been given many compliments.) I love the look of this product! It is pretty and sexy, which is hard to find in a body shaper. It also breathes, unlike other body shapers where I am uncomfortable. It also does a great job of staying up around the waist and not rolling down- again very comfortable. I also like how the butt area isn't super tight, where other body shapers leave a very noticeable underwear line. The butt area is also very comfortable; it doesn't ride up or pinch. I wish that this sucked in the stomach area a little more, but it offers great support and smooths the stomach area. The shipping was timely, and I have had no issues with the product. It has held up nicely after 3 washings. I am very happy overall.
NEG 	I downloaded it for a smart tv and found it difficult to move the curser. I love the game bud didn't like it on the TV
NEG 	They do what I bought them for just fine. When working in the garage, crawling through the attic, or landscaping in the yard, these protect my knees when I need to be down on them. Deducted one star because the Velcro straps were pulling a bit and needed to be trimmed.
NEG 	If you're not going to be using it every day, I definitely recommend this case. It's very nice looking and gets the job done. Because of the price, I would never expect it to hold up everyday wear and tear for longer than a couple months, but I'm happy with the purchase. Would buy again.
NEG 	So far so good. My kids are enjoying this singing machine. Seems easy to use.
NEG 	This really helped me out when I was having some bad day with plantar. When my feet hurt bad enough I put them on and the pain really backs down.
NEG 	Loved them, but do look at chart size before ordering them, the gray area in the picture of them is actually black, not the light gray as shown.
NEG 	This top is really cute! It is more of a t-shirt thickness than a sweatshirt. I usually take an x-small or a small and I got this one in a medium to give me more room after reading other reviews and it fits perfectly.
NEG 	I needed to tow my MG Midget in for repair and these lights were just what I needed to be legal. Like the fact they are LED so should last a very long time. Great value.
NEG 	My only dislike about this product is that it can't really be used to store the staples after it is opened without them spilling out. Not a big deal and wouldn't affect a future purchase however. I have also had a problem with staple jams but since the stapler is new, I cannot say if it is the stapler or the staples. Visually the staples appear to be of good quality without burrs or things that would obviously cause problems.
NEG 	It's a cute hat. Definitely worth the price. It has a tendency to leave the bottoms of my ears in the cold, which is a bummer because I live in Maine. But it's better than the alternative of me not wearing a hat because it looks too stupid.
NEG 	This is plastic but looks like metal. I'm glad I bought it, we raise sheep so I like to have alittle bit of "farm" decor here and there and this was a perfect accent piece.
NEG 	These are a nice quality but too loose. Even when I slide them to the very end of the temples of my sunglasses they don’t fit snugly around my head. But I read here that someone else fixed that by cutting off a bit of the ends to shorten them, so I think I’ll give that a try.
NEG 	Absolutely love them!!! Just takes forever to get them started and the purple one could be more purple than lavender.
NEG 	They were exactly what I was looking for, shipped quickly
NEG 	you get what you see, I only gave 4 cause the wire had to be adjusted to close earrings but they are very nice, I ordered twice and would order again, thanks , shipping time was reasonable.
NEG 	The product fits well. Top not as long as I wanted it but it will do
NEG 	I like this flavor. I like the little cans, alternative route to sodas for me.
NEG 	Mildly neutral herbal flavor, nothing remarkable about it. I bought it for the calming properties and it seems to help decrease anxiety.
NEG 	I really like how you can mount this to any chair. Easy to use. Easy strap onto chair. The only problem is the tray is difficult to snap in.
NEG 	This is great for the beginning stepper. Sturdy and easy to adjust height. My only word of caution is that it is smaller than expected. On the upside, that makes it easy to store out of the way. But I wear a size 7 1/2 shoe and my feet fit just right. I would be nervous if my feet were much bigger. Overall I am very happy with this purchase.
NEG 	I like this, it’s just as it looks on line. I wish it was made a little heavier and with stronger materials, but it is very cute. I’m giving it for Christmas and I think the person will like it.
NEG 	Fun game. Except 15 levels in you cannot win or enjoy without spending money, lots of money. I hope for more value for my hard earned dollar. Maybe it is just me. I find no fault in the developers being rewarded for their hard work, I just want my money to stretch more. But, a good game.
NEG 	Very cute and a great price
NEG 	A practical way to learn and or review American signs. Some signs are not as clear as other venues I've used, but the cards are easily portable.
NEG 	This set works well for me. It is not as sturdy as some I looked at, but it is as sturdy as I need for it to be. It was a great buy for the price!
NEG 	Still have eye irritation when using but not as bad as the store brands.
NEG 	The socks are very cute. The quality is very good.
NEG 	good leash. Both handles make it quite simple to control my puppy who's not leash trained nicely. The adjustable clips means I will shorten it to ensure that he stays right next to me without any distractions. I have gotten a great deal of use from it so much better.
NEG 	Purchased as a Christmas gift. Nice weight and soft material.
NEG 	Not enough disply ports
NEG 	The instructions were solid until the top of the closet. Then they were lacking a way that made understanding the process ridiculously challenging.
NEG 	These are nice to have however, the edges are very sharp! I used these clips to put a new blanket binding around a baby quilt and when I slipped it off the blanket it sliced through the binding. I also cut my hand and a finger. I hade to sew a patch on the blanket binding.
NEG 	Nice chair ,good support . Don’t like the arm rest they swivel around too much and can’t lock in place . Overall very happy with purchase
NEG 	Nice clock but too complicated for me.
NEG 	Looks good, protects phone well, but fits too tight in holster, kick stand should be more centered. Otherwise pleased.
NEG 	These leggings are super comfortable and I wear them a lot at the gym. I’m 5’4” and they fit me as regular length leggings, which is what I was expecting. Unfortunately they slide down a lot when I wear them at the gym so they’re not great for running.
NEG 	Stayed on my head without being tight, no hat headache.
NEG 	Worked pretty darn good, pleasantly surprised.
NEG 	I got this to carry my kids phone. It works great for that, and a couple other things too. It has a small zipper pouch for money, and then two large (phone sized) pouches. It is well made, I would give it 5 starts but one of the buttons is less then perfect and seems hard to snap or unsnap. Didn't seem worth returning it though.
NEG 	Got these to help with pregnancy-related swelling and varicose veins. Provides great compression, but it was quite a bit of a workout to pull these on. Once on, worked great, but the top part can gradually slide down, which can be hard to adjust if you're wearing pants. Otherwise, good stockings.
NEG 	Looks just like picture! Daughter loves them!
NEG 	This is perfect for me since I spend most of my day stuck in an office chair and bent over a computer screen. My legs and back feel a lot better than they usually do thanks to this. It feels like I'm sitting on a very soft pillow all the time. I wish it came in more colors though.
NEG 	The movie was not as good as the one with Kurt Russel. But it was funny . Different twist.
NEG 	I wished it had a perforations
NEG 	I'm fine with this product at this point
NEG 	This product works great and is a must have for the cordless headset.
NEG 	Most colors (pink, purple, green) work great and washes out perfectly! It is pretty sticky/slash firm after application so don’t plan to brush afterwards. Also rubs off on clothing etc.
NEG 	The earrings were too long for my short neck, so I gave them to my hippie-chick pal and she loves them.
NEG 	I ordered the shirt for my son who is big and tall it fits him great he likes it fabric is nice
NEG 	I love this game! It is very immersive and there are many missions and events. I just dislike how much experience it takes to be able to make a Mon max 6.
NEG 	It's a foam topper. What can I say? can't imagine why anyone would pay 4-5 times the price. It's a piece of foam People! Don't expect it to change your life.
NEG 	When this wig came, it looked like Snow White had a rough night. But, after looking at a few Youtube videos on how to fix cheap wigs, it came out great! Set your curling iron on the lowest setting, section off small rows of hair and gently brush and curl each section. After I fixed the wig, it looked like an expensive one. My daughter received many compliments on her wig on Halloween!
NEG 	Great for small apartments good quality
NEG 	Beautiful jacket however some people’s jackets had a beautiful floral lining and mine did not but it doesn’t take away from the beauty of the jacket. The reviews lead you to believe you need to size up for larger arms and breasts but you don’t. I am a 34DDD with muscular arms and had to return my Xl for a L and that has NEVER happened to me. I will definitely purchase in another color as well.
NEG 	no need to get under the edge of the toilet.
NEG 	Have it on my bedside table, use it to charge my phone overnight. Two issues: it is very picky about exact placement for charging, and when it is charging, a light is always on. Only an issue if you're light sensitive like I am I guess...
NEG 	I purchased the large in this dress because other reviews said they fit on the smaller side...which is accurate. It was super cute and comfortable. I even purchased the black in the same style, but that one was actually bigger, so I will be returning that one. The sizes aren't consistent, but I at least found one that worked.
NEG 	For the price it’s a nice Duvet cover. I had hoped it would be a little softer but perhaps with more washings it will be. Also, I’m using it on a split king and it could be a little wider
NEG 	I use these cloths for everything and then just throw them in the wash. Great!
NEG 	I absolutely loved the fact that it’s a macrame light AND plant holder! Delivered quickly and safely. I didn’t know before hand that an actual light bulb wasn’t included but it wasn’t a problem for me since I had one with a cord because of a prior diy light project! Just wanted to mention that in case anyone thought it would come with the light and cord included.... great project, kind of wish it wasn’t so stringy but it is still super amazing and will look awesome in my dorm!
NEG 	Also bought this for the wife, she love it also
NEG 	Orange plastic is hard plastic not soft. Might be quicker to break.
NEG 	Plastic in a couple of places where the original was metal. Excellent fit. Immediate start and smooth running.
NEG 	Looks elegant and feels luxurious! It’s just a tad bit too small but still wearable
NEG 	This is a beautiful tile design. As other reviewers noted, the graphics line up pretty well ONLY when you pay attention and lay them out first before sticking them down. I've noticed that the glue-stick is not that strong, and the corners started poking up and catching on our socks as we walked across the floor. Also, the floor is pretty slick - we are having to look into some kind of floor grip to spray on it.
NEG 	I used these with my Android phone. I like how they fit in my ears; they're very comfortable. They have very good sound.
NEG 	I've been using the braided stretch belts with the normal buckles for about 10 years now and they keep breaking down over time and becoming a nuisance. I bought these hoping that the buckle and belt material would solve the problems I've been having from the other belts, and so far it seems hopeful. The included buckles are easy to use and grip the belts across the full surface which should prevent the belts from breaking down so quickly. There is just enough stretch to move with me without being too tight. The only downsides so far: The width of the belt, I believe, was described as 1.5" which is almost too wide to fit into some of my belt loops. The only other problem I've noticed so far is that the belt is a little thin and stiff, that mixed with the height of the belt causes it to make contact with my lower back waist when sitting which is very uncomfortable.
NEG 	Cool drone, mine came damaged returned
NEG 	Nice but kinda cheap
NEG 	Purchased this for vacation since my phone dies all the time. First time I used it I didn't have to recharge it for 2 days. I noticed, however, that as time as gone on I have to recharge it more and more so that's the only thing i'm concerned about. However, for the price it does what it's supposed to.
NEG 	I was crossing my fingers that the two collars I ordered would work. This is a four-Corgi household, and two of them bark a lot. One barks just to bark. So, when a neighbor (nicely and rightfully) complained, I did a lot of research and selected this brand. It took less than a day for Abe and Emmy to catch on once the collars were on them. Ah, "the sounds of silence"! It's a quality, sturdy product and being able to recharge it rather than buying batteries was a big plus for me. Two observations I'd like to share: (1) one reviewer remarked that the unit was too big for her small dog. Emmy is petite and 22 pounds, and the unit is a bit overwhelming on her neck, too. (2) The unit went off once when Abe shook his head, and once when another dog standing near him barked. Changing the sensitivity eliminated the unit going off when he shakes his head, but not when a nearby dog barks. All in all, this was money well spent!
NEG 	Haven't tried them yet but I purchased them to wear at the hospital. I may buy a few more because I love wearing slippers around the house but the always seem to fall off the back.
NEG 	Doubts on actually Stainless Steel used, effective either way.
NEG 	This comforter is super soft! Only con is that it is very HOT. I burn up at night like crazy.
NEG 	Not quite sure how to review this, haven’t taken it long enough to know if it is protecting my skin against the harmful UV rays, or helping with regeneration yet. I do know that my dermatologist endorsed taking this, so I’m trying it. I do think the pills are large and tend to stick in your throat, so one at a time with extra water.
NEG 	These are rather stylish and simple sock shoes. They are very comfortable and great in the summer. I would not recommend wearing these on a rainy day as they are effectively socks with a sole. After three months of constant use the stitching has held up surprisingly well, but it seems that I have torn the inside of the sole and my feet are now digging it out. Also would not recommend running or going on any difficult terrain in these as they do not have any ankle support and I have found my ankle slipping around. Overall a very aesthetic and eye drawing shoe, that will maybe last you a season or 2 for the price.
NEG 	These are so adorable, and maybe when I am down to my summer weight they will look better, but the medium/large, as it is, is too snug to wear. The straps give me muffin tops. I want them to work so I am keeping them, but I don't know if this summer will be the year I wear them. Typically I wear a 28 in jeans, a M in anything with stretch.
NEG 	Good starter glasses for the "bifocal" resistant crowd . Light, comfy, might not survive? Smaller frame size, so putting them on stretches them a bit.
NEG 	Enjoyed this action novel, well developed story line and characters
NEG 	ok Not as sturdy as expected.
NEG 	Very nice stands, the routing of the wiring in the base isn't the most convenient and could definitely be improved but otherwise very nice.
NEG 	Great looks,build, and lighting! Things that could make it better are wrist rest/volume scroll wheel otherwise it is the perfect look for my setup.
NEG 	At first reading the reviews, I was thinking there was no way she did that. After reading, I still felt a little skip every time Tris came up. It makes sense. Obviously, I'm not happy about Four and Christina being together, but I'd rather it be her than someone who doesn't understand him or Tris. I kinda wish there was more about Caleb though. I'll take what I can get when it comes to the divergent series.
NEG 	I thought they would be a little bigger. But they still look great around our pond.
NEG 	This game is fun. I like it a lot.
NEG 	We always have a blast with these during any public holiday Fireworks displays with our grandkids and any other kids at the parks. As we see other kids come by we offer them to let the balloons fly. Kids have a blast with these and surprised when we offer. The only issue is that these tend to pop a lot. within about 2 hours, we probably had 15 balloons popped. also, some seemed to have smaller openings or are difficult to insert the pump into them. However, still worth fun it provides for all the kids.
NEG 	Light weight and soft , perfect for summer
NEG 	These almost always work, and are well worth the price for the clothing they've protected. Unfortunately there have been a few items that bled and this didn't catch the dye. Overall I still like and use them, though.
NEG 	Good product... But does roll down in back.
NEG 	This one is it folks. This is as good as it's ever gonna get. You can adjust this to your dogs face and it will be really difficult to get off if you do one added thing. Tie the left and right straps hanging down under the chin together with a secure tie of some sort to bring the ends under his chin together. This makes it more snug and makes is virtually impossible to get off if you have it securely strapped around the doggies head. Bubs is comfortable and can breathe and wears it for long walks. This has saved my life and I feel so much more confident and so much less anxiety having this muzzle on. All other muzzles failed.
NEG 	Worked fine. Decent price for outdoor product.
NEG 	Easy to use! A helpful addition to your medicine cabinet. Makes taking kids temperatures quick and easy!
NEG 	It came packaged securely, delivery wasn’t the fastest, but it came in the time frame they provided. It is still cracking well, we will see how long it last.
NEG 	Great for calligraphy, outlining, and various pen and ink styles. Rich black color, and tip stays firm and sharp after almost a year. However, runs out of ink fairly quickly.
NEG 	This thing is awesome. The included instructions told us everything we would need and were easy to follow. My only complaint is the back bracket is quite tall and only putting the arms on the lowest position possible on the TV were we able to put the TV up without covering the back panel inputs of the TV. We love that we can easily move the TV around to avoid glare, see more easily from the floor, etc.
NEG 	Somewhat small, but super efficient!
NEG 	Material is thin, reminded me of a cheap plastic table cloth. I wasn’t going to reuse it so it did the job for a day. It is big enough to cover an average size wall.
NEG 	The material is not as thick as I expected. I'm 5'2 and 130lbs usually wear a small/medium in bathing suits depending on the style. I probably should've gotten a large because the bottoms are very tight around my thighs and the medium top is a little small for me and I'm a 34D.
NEG 	Product works great had trouble figuring it out. Only add 1oz of soap and gill rest up with water.
NEG 	This was a fast moving story with the hero killing beasties and trying to cope with new world he's bren transported too
NEG 	Good movie, doesn't move too slow and has an original plot.
NEG 	This iis a nice book. This book has been a life -saver for me. Very well written and easy to read this book. I like this book.
NEG 	loks like what ordered
NEG 	Would have been 5 star but the adhesive they use on the label was impossible for me to get fully removed I love this thing, it is a great quality board. I needed a smaller board to go with my big one. This is a perfect compliment to the large one I have When I replace that large board,l I will be looking to this company for its replacement
NEG 	Very short not very suspenseful. Obvious who done it, and very easy to figure things out. No surprises in the book.
NEG 	We love the bigger screen. We still find new things Alexa can do. Amazing!
NEG 	These are better tasting that some protein bars and they have better nutrition than a lot that you can get at Walmart
NEG 	they work well. Strange they are in a bag of 5 though.
NEG 	Needs to be sharpened, but not bad.
NEG 	My new battery charged but kept overheating and old batteries never charged at all.
NEG 	They do what they are suppose to warn people about a new driver but the quality was not great all 3 were cracked the magnet part was fine. The colors were also different than represented in the photos. A brighter color like bright yellow would be better.
NEG 	During assembly it seems like it was made as cheap as possible. Easy assembly 1 person but you need tools. Drill and rubber mallet. The stickers make it look better but I hope they don’t get ripped off. It came missing the braces for the floor. I think step 2 sends you missing parts for free though. The floor is a great anti fatigue mat. Kid loves it he’s 2. It takes up more space than I realized. You have to have room to walk around it.
NEG 	works well in the space planned
NEG 	IT'S WINDY WHERE I LIVE AND MANY OF THE OTHER UMBRELLA'S DIDN'T HAVE AIR VENTS.
NEG 	Fully covers windshield and holds even in the Windy City, Chicago.
NEG 	A pretty watch and chain. Quality seems good. The stem broke after 2 years of use...probably my fault in winding it too vigorously... and the repair cost estimate was double the price of the watch. I may get another one and try and be more gentle when winding it. Overall I think it is well worth the price.
NEG 	My daughter has this & is not using the crystals that came with it because not all her brushes would fit if the crystals where in the bottom. She wishes the price was lower but is using it on her desk.
NEG 	I love this thing because is keeps my kids in the yard and their friends can come over and play with them. This has been a life saver this spring already. Can not wait for more summer days. The only reason I give it 4 stars is he draining process. It is horrible. Sometimes I do not want to set it up because of how slow it drains. It takes a toll on your body.
NEG 	I was able to purchase more ink for the same cost as the name brand inks. They work just as well and produce quality prints.
NEG 	The candy is heaven. The price is hell. Don't order when it's hot.
NEG 	Nothing wrong with the item, but when Amazon tells me it was delivered on Wednesday, and it really came on Friday, leaves a sour note on the delivery person's ability to read a address label.
NEG 	A bit difficult to tear apart at the perforation, but worth the effort to use totally biodegradable bags.
NEG 	This maybe my best purchase from Amazon!!! I did what felt like as much research as humanly possible before deciding to buy this bike... Money well spent, I couldn't be happier than I am right now writing this (3 months) after purchase. To those that had a bad experience... I'm truly sorry that you were not pleased with what you received, but I dare say that you over expected... Ancheer did Not under deliver!!! The assembly was a cinch and the battery last for a surprising long time when using pedal assist. I purchased a new (wider) seat, the bag and rack before my bike got delivered. So when my bike arrived (two days earlier than expected) I was able to put it together completely (in less than two hours) and I have been riding ever since!!! Ancheer did an amazing job on this bike and I say this without question, "this is only my first ebike, it won't be my last"!!!
NEG 	works perfectly for small little projects.
NEG 	Great natural product. Look really nice in my herb and tomato garden
NEG 	I haven't used the product consistently, but my hair does seem to be fuller since I've been using it.
NEG 	Assembly instructions aren't the best so this took a little longer than I would have wanted, and I didn't have all my tools with me so I had to improvise, but I did get it put together and it's pretty sturdy considering it's bolted together from little strips of metal. The built in light is a nice touch as is the electrical outlets on the sides. Drawer slides are a tiny bit "sticky" and it would be nicer to have 5 or 6 outlets instead of 3 (especially when the light uses 1) but if you're looking for an economical work table for your shop or garage, this is a good choice
NEG 	The book really got me interested from the start. Many grim parts to it but definitely a read thats worth it.
NEG 	very practical and does not take a lot of space
NEG 	This greatly reduced irritated skin (bumps, rash and ingrown hairs) Made shaving smoother too. Nice fragrance without being overwhelming.
NEG 	Looks like in the picture. It protects my laptop very well. Keep in mind that you won’t be able to use the tablet mode. It’s a great product, however, you can’t increase the degree between keyboard and screen more than 45-50 degrees or the laptop will tilt back a little due to the weight.
NEG 	And nice easy read - a little wordy and slightly slow in the beginning but if you get past that it’s just a nice time travel romance.
NEG 	Needed basic ram for a older MacBook Pro which I picked up on eBay ... this stick slipped in with no issues with either compatibility or performance ...
NEG 	I didn't care for the pattern on this dress once I saw it in person. The flowers were much more prominent than the light teal. Way too tight in the chest for me but I'm busty to begin with and also nursing right now. Was able to return this without any issues
NEG 	First fpv quad. Great combo for learning to fly.
NEG 	good game for the price... wish there was more of a game involved in it but either way it's a good way to practice as a "do now" for my students
NEG 	I purchased 8gb of RAM to upgrade my 2012 MacBook Pro. It definitely helped. RAM in general is way over priced now days but if your computer is compatible with these I would suggest purchasing some RAM. Overall a good purchase and I haven’t had any issues so far. It’s been about a month or more since my purchase.
NEG 	Actually this product works great. I gave it four stars because the bins could stand to be deeper.
NEG 	This is all as expected
NEG 	So far, so good!! I have used this several times, it has kept my strawberries fresh for much longer than their original packaging. It seems to work better for strawberries than raspberries. Have not used it with any other berries yet.
NEG 	Beautiful color palette. The metallic was very durable. However, the paper ones were a little too fragile. Overall, it worked for its purpose.
NEG 	Ordered one size larger, fit is good.
NEG 	The first third and last third of this volume were interesting, fast reads. I got bogged down in the middle section which discussed the intricate details of Hamilton’s influence as Treasury Secretary on the American Banking system. However, this biography still merits a solid four stars from me.
NEG 	***Updated to four stars - I contacted Amazon’s customer service. Within a few hours, I was sent an apology for the inconvenience and promised a refund.*** I ordered my daughter two of these in a small as she wears a small in her gymnastics leotards and another brand dance leotard. I did not check the return policy because I’ve always been able to return absolutely anything I’ve ever bought off amazon with no issue. Guess it’s my own fault, but it stinks now that I’m stuck with two leotards that are too small.
NEG 	Had issues with first unit, customer service was great in getting me replacement, has worked great ever since! Perfect option for people looking for small backup camera and dash cam!
NEG 	I upgraded to this setup from a stock blade inductrix fpv which just didn't have enough power. The frame is is the exact same dimensions but a little heavier and feels sturdier than the stock blade inductrix fpv frame. The inductrix board fits perfectly. The motors are a BIG step up from the inductrix fpv motors, and the board seems to be able to handle them just fine. I agree with a couple other reviewers that motor QC is not great - one motor came with a slightly bent shaft - visible when turning the prop and enough to cause slight vibration on the fpv cam. Still flies fine, but I'm worried the motor will burn out early and it's already wearing out the motor mount too. Even so, I'm happy overall with the performance and value.
NEG 	Love it even more on person. Unique and super cute Material
NEG 	A little light but works good
NEG 	I love taking these to the ocean because they are much harder to lose than flip flops, and much prettier than most water shoes. they fit in your pocket and can be rinsed off for easy sand removal
NEG 	Okay item but more for a very small toddler. Even the boy on the box is to big for this item. I have a 3 year old and yet this works for now the toilet is pretty short. Also seems uncomfortable to my boy for long sittings (like pooping).
NEG 	Dogs like the product but I find the packaging makes it difficult to spoon out the product without making a mess. Putting it in a wide mouth jar would be easier to use.
NEG 	Very good, very valuable for learning, children like it very much
NEG 	Cheaper price for 4 times as much as the heavily advertised ones. I do wish that they were flavored though...
NEG 	The tent comes in a nice shade of gray and green. It also has a mosquito net, so you can zip up the tent but still allow air to go into the tent. However, even with the pictures on the instruction sheet, I still had trouble folding it back. In the end, my partner was able to fold it back without the help of the instructions.
NEG 	These are bright and built pretty good. But, a bit overpriced for the name and other more affordable led bulbs I've used are just as bright and built extremely well and durable.
NEG 	Cute shirt but doesn’t have the knot like it shows in the picture. Just have to tie it on your own.
NEG 	Does the job, but wish it had more padding.
NEG 	So far it seems to be really great! As suggested by other reviewers, I’m going to try and add support to the middle to prevent sagging/ripping. As of right now my cats seem to love it, I was really surprised. They lay in it on their own accord, and they will even jump in when I call them over to it. Problem: mine is a bit hard to open and close. I looked at the videos online, and mine does not seem that easy to open up and close. I have to use a lot of force to unlock the latch.
NEG 	This other reviews are right, this ring does run small by about 1/4 size... I ordered a size 5 and it is the exact same size as my 4.75 sized wedding bands .... but for me, that was perfect bc I won’t have to size it down, but something to be aware of, also the ring box it came in was all smashed and smooshed when it arrived and I could barely open the box up... the ring was fine and it worked so that’s all that matters- hopefully the ring holds up
NEG 	my favorite go to knife smart a light weight quick opening funtional already order 2 more i would like to see one for law enforcement
NEG 	They all are cute and well made. The black and white leopard print bow is not even, like it was rushed when it was made. Other than that I think they are super cute!
NEG 	Love this shirt, but the arms are a little tight. Length was long. Covers my pockets in my jeans. Loose fitting everywhere but the arms.
NEG 	I only wish it was bigger. Love throwing frozen cauliflower tots in the most. Crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Even my teens use it.
NEG 	This product worked well! It didn’t pull at my hair and straightened it nicely.
NEG 	I purchased these on a whim because I thought they would be useful to me. I used them on a couple trips and found them to work well but did not really work for what I was doing. If they auto adjusted I think I would have liked them better but having to push in the adjuster button and move the jaws one spot was sometimes tricky so I took them out of my travel box and put them in my home tool box. This tool is built amazingly well though and it works well which is why I am still giving it 4 stars. It just didnt work well for what I planned on using it for.
NEG 	The boards or slippery. And the bag ripped after second time using them. They work but sucks that the bag isn’t usable anymore. LED lights work great!
NEG 	It holds a ton of clothes, it’s definitely made cheaply but that’s what I expected for the price anyway. I think the zipper could bust if you have the bag stuffed, but it should be fine if you leave room in it.
NEG 	Pretty good! Average nose rings. 6mm was a little small for me but I should have known better. Would be cuter in someone with a smaller nose. Good mixed variety of colors
NEG 	I pair was exactly what i ordered the other pair was the wrong color.
NEG 	Ok..don't like the dust
NEG 	Product works great right out the box, I had an older version that wasn’t working so I went ahead and got this differently not disappointed, I would recommend it.
NEG 	Great product, wires and adapter are sturdy. Wires are together which avoids tangling. Only wish they were longer (to use on other batteries / machinery).
NEG 	After many attempts of trying to peel the icing off the paper I decided that I had to freeze it for about 3 hours just to get it off and put it on my son's birthday cake.
NEG 	Very happy with this flashlight....Very bright....long lasting battery.....only con and the 4 star rating is because it gets hot after 5 to 10 minutes of use
NEG 	My son really likes this mouse only complaint is the buttons sticking occasionally.
NEG 	Purchased for my daughter for Christmas. She is an amateur photographer. She loves the bag and it keeps all of her lenses and camera paraphernalia well organized and handy.
NEG 	The book is about WICCA.The book describes the full access to all of the spells – and learn how to create our own! I have already practice them, and enjoy the benefits every time.Reading this book you will learn secret of Wiccan spells that you can use immediately.Overall a good book.Happy Reading!!
NEG 	sturdy yet light weight - good shooting platform that is easy to set up - I really like the pivoting head. Virtually silent operation is really nice. Only drawback for me is it is still a little short for me if all three legs aren't fully extended (like when on uneven ground), I am 6'1" tall and have to lean over a little bit under these conditions but it works. Definitely worth the $$.
NEG 	Nice case with magnetic closure along with nice fit.
NEG 	It is a very good phone case but it can be harder to plug in a thick charger. Other than that is is great and affordable
NEG 	Love it been playing for a year and can do the puzzles over in different formats.
NEG 	This unit arrived in good condition, via double boxes. The one minor issue is the poor quality of the 4 screws (included) to support the mirror. Recommend replacing them with American made screws. Recommend installing a Plexiglas top to protect the desktop BEFORE mounting mirror. Otherwise, excellent unit for the price.
NEG 	I like the movie and how it started but kinda rambled and went slow... not much of a satisfying ending
NEG 	As described and comfortable.
NEG 	Very very elegant top ot was just too small.
NEG 	This combo came today, and I’m pretty happy with it. The rod seems well-made, and the finish is great! Looks really nice. Just be sure to check your knots. The leader/line and line/backing knots both came undone with a slight tug. Had to tie them back on. No big deal, but I’m glad I checked before I went fishing. The flies are garbage, which I think we all knew anyway. The fly box is great though. Going to make it my nymph box. Very satisfied with it for the price. Will update when I take it out on the streams.
NEG 	These pug ears were great, they took my mastiff a while to get threw. My only quark with them and it's a big one, is there is soooooo much red dye in them. By the time he was done with them my carpet was dyed radish brown. And I know the dye can't be that great for him if there's that much in them. One request....can you do these without the dye? I'm not concerned about what they look like and neither is he if they are quality products.
NEG 	The case is nice and probably saved me from dinging the remote multiple times. The strap piece of the silicone ripped however so I can't use that anymore. 5 stars if the silicone didn't rip.
NEG 	Works well for small projects and for beginners
NEG 	A lot of truth to the novels premis . A bit of fun with historical facts and conspiracy theories .
NEG 	Smaller than it should be.
NEG 	I like the customization of all the buttons. Drawing pressure makes a difference, nice fluidity. Froze a couple of times when I drew close to the edge of the drawing area, had to unplug and plug back in.
NEG 	This product is great. I used them to hang up clothes in the closet and they help reduce the appearance of clutter. I like that the hook can be flipped to the smaller or larger size depending on what it’s used for. I gave it a 4 overall because the little clear tips come off too easily.
NEG 	This pillow came vacuum sealed in a tight little bag, as we opened it, it puffed up to a large soft comfortable pilllow, I love the big puffy pillows and sink into them as I sleep. I’m a side sleeper and love the stability it gives my neck. We have animals boyhood cats and dog, I am hoping this pillow helps a lot with the cat hair and sander that my husband is allergic to, guess we will see
NEG 	This is more like a cover up for getting out of the water than a towel.
NEG 	This series is so addicting
NEG 	Holds a lot of products. Easily customizable. The only annoying thing is that the notches that hold the organizer together, protrude and take up space on the top shelf. Other than that, it is very handy.
NEG 	Nice gift for niece! Loved it! Would recommend!
NEG 	Received . Very nice . Recommend it highly
NEG 	Love the size and the easy maintenance on this clippers. Easy to recharge and don’t have to worry about any cords. The only down side I saw is that it’s doesn’t cut as close as an edger but other than that it’s a great and well made product
NEG 	We were able to fix our dryer for a much cheaper cost than if we had resorted to replacing it. My husband installed it with few problems.
NEG 	Yes I thought the light pad was going to be bigger. That the only problems that I have with this item.
NEG 	I bought this for my 4 year old nephew for Christmas. His room is farm themed so I thought this would be great. It's not too big so it won't take up a lot of room, but not so small that it doesn't put out enough light. It's made of some sort of silicone or rubbery material so if it gets knocked off it won't break. It doesn't get hot to the touch after it's been on for awhile either. My only complaint is I ordered the "blue" which ended up being more of what I would call a purple, but it's still super cute! It also doesn't come with the outlet plug just the USB cord.
NEG 	Wish they were taller in the heels, they rub a bit walking, but other than that nice
NEG 	exactly what I was hoping it was gonna be like, see in spring if it holds up thru the winter
NEG 	I ordered a small, 5’3” 115lbs and it’s a little loose underarm area. Also is a little too long but I wore with wedges. Dress quality isn’t great but it’s perfect for a cute summer maxi dress. The pattern has a bit more tan than the photo. Wore it on spring break for a dressy dinner and had a lot of compliments. It doesn’t look like an inexpensive dress. I am glad I decided to keep it.
NEG 	Not bad ends could be better made had to cover with rubber paint to keep water from getting in
NEG 	I like the clear bins because you can see thru them and get what ever food item is in it. They are not as sturdy as the bins that come with the frig so I will not put my most heavy condiments or jars in these bins. Nice to have the vegetables that I'm using daily be so accessible and the bin is easy to pull out of the frig.
NEG 	All paints in good condition.
NEG 	Very loose. Returned item as it was very baggy as expected, but too baggy to be worn as anything other than ren fair attire with corset and shelf bra? Also very see through, even white under garment would be extremely visible. Went with different color and thicker material as more multi purpose.
NEG 	Blade handle is a little flimsy but all other items are high quality.
NEG 	The scent is good and it last all day,good item to buy.
NEG 	Seems just right except that the tripod is a bit large; takes up some desktop real estate. But it's a heavy, well made item so it needs the stability. Give it a five anyway.
NEG 	Theses work great! I bought these to light the mailbox for parties at our house so people would know where to turn into the driveway. The other option was run 100 foot extension cord, and that would have gotten in the way of mowing. These provide decent light considering they are solar. The light they emit is more in the blue spectrum than the warm white spectrum. There are several different flashing settings or solid on. I have no clue how long they last, but they out of juice when we wake up the next day when they are left on the flashing setting. But before we go to bed they have generally been on about 4 hours, so they get at least that for us. Neither set has had any problems yet. Very Happy
NEG 	Note: Changed this review from 1 star to 4 stars after the seller reached out to me and issued a full refund (I did not even have to return the unused portion). This is good seller and you have nothing to lose by trying this product. If it works, then that's awesome. If not, you can get a refund. That being said, this product did not help our dog. We have a 14 year old female shepherd-hound mix who has developed separation anxiety. We were hoping these would help, but, although she enjoys eating them, she still barks constantly and gets very agitated when left alone.
NEG 	very easy, quick installation. no other difference with web searches but with peace of mind of the added security
NEG 	Full disclosure... I LOVE Teva in general so am likely prejudiced. Anyway, these are my me favorites sports sandals. Fit is perfect, just the right support in the right places, and they look nice too. The ankle strap did initially rub slightly as the day progressed and my feet swell a bit, but that has eased over time.
NEG 	The charger works, don't get me wrong. If you have the time to just let your phone charge and not use it (like overnight or while working), its an awesome product. If not you may like its USB charging option which comes in hand. Its kinda like a USB charging extension chord. Your phone will charge (again slower than usual) but you have some distance. The only reason it's not a five-star review is because of the speed of charging, otherwise a great product.
NEG 	Overall I love this product, my main problem is it freezes and the battery doesn't last long.
NEG 	Great setting powder for under eye
NEG 	This credit card holder works fine. I only wish it could hold more. It came just in time, it came just before I left for my vacation. I like it, it works fine.
NEG 	First season using it. Doing good so far
NEG 	It is a little difficult to put up
NEG 	I like the picture, it is very clear, and the sound is good, it could be a little higher with the volume, but, it is sufficient. I had recieved the player and it seemed the one I got was glitchy, kept skipping, well stalling, and freezing up. So I contacted the seller and they quickly replaced the player no questioned asked. This one works perfect. Very Happy Customer. Thanks, Richard and Jeanne
NEG 	arrived in a timely manner - was just as described - serves its purpose - pill holder !
NEG 	Very beautiful wood and clean. No dents or scratches. Arrived with everything separated and bubble wrapped. Took two people to assemble and needed a power drill. Then found there was no netting for my bunny to stay clean. My dad bought some netting from ace hardware for about $10. Added to the bottom like a floor. She looks very happy and clean. The indoor hutch is her favorite to hide away from kids and other dogs. It gave her privacy. However she chewed up the entry to the hutch. Hopefully this home last long for her.
NEG 	Honestly, a pretty good headset. I was skeptical cause I wanted a comfortable high quality headset and they seemed bulky. They are kinda large but still lightweight and sturdy. I barely notice there on. Until someone tries to talk to me through all that noise cancellation. The mic does have a USB and audio connection piece which is kinda extra for me on PS4 I also like it fits good on my head with a lot or little hair.
NEG 	This is a decent product--and very simple. It does not- as far as I can see-cause any skin issues--and has little scent. It is however housed in a ridiculous large brown box--that makes no sense--and is very difficult to open
NEG 	Brilliant acting portraying irreverent cartoonist J. Callahan. Don't watch this if you're looking for a fast paced comedy and don't review this as a crappy movie if you blindly watched it with no idea what it was about. Do some research; even from your mother's basement you probably have connectivity to accomplish this. Worth the watch to see Jonah Hill's acting chops and the sweet pain of J. Callahan's life. I wonder what people in the "program" think of this. So, because I don't have much connection on that point, I give it a four star. I still loved the movie.
NEG 	Not sure what I expected. It retains a lot of heat. Sometimes wake up sweating.
NEG 	Most everything is good quality. The aluminum clips are the only pieces that lack. Overall totally worth the pricetag.
NEG 	The only reason it’s missing a star is because it came damaged. Was going to return it but not worth the hassle since the Blu-ray itself was still good.
NEG 	I just received these and so far they’re really comfortable! I’ve been walking around and standing in them for an hour now with moderate sitting in between and my feet isn’t throbbing. If they continue as expected, I will have to purchase some more of the other styles!
NEG 	Wife lived that I found her favorite hair treatment in a value size!
NEG 	Great cheap bag, have used it for past 1.5 years on 5 backpacking trips and no issues so far.
NEG 	I love this mini handy converter. It's small and easy to carry. This lightning adapter looks cool with the black color. This is a useful devices for me. It was fairly simple to use and I was able to both charge my phone and plug in my earphones at the same time! My kids super love this lightning hdmi adapter,it's very simple for them to use it. With this converter,they can enjoy 1080P HD big screen from the iPad and share the movies or playing games together on HDTV! Plug and play, no need Wifi or other apps. Everything is perfect! Very pleased with my purchase.
NEG 	Super cool book for kids and adults! Got this for my 5 year old who expressed interest in learning about the body. Book is a really nice size and has a good amount of pages, not many but just enough not to overwhelm on info.
NEG 	Bought it for 2016 Ford Explorer..Very high quality seat covers. Didn't rip during installation. Had to adjust certain spots and cut holes for headrest. Took a lot of time (1.5 hrs) to install but overall it was worth it. Quality feels like it should last awhile.
NEG 	Just took a few minutes to set up and has pretty decent pic. Very clear and nice adjustable led. Actually works better than the Depstech wired one. App is easy to navigate.
NEG 	I have 5 and 7lb dogs and they do the job. Seem to be sturdy and durable.
NEG 	I love the interior and exterior pockets. the color is vibrant - a fun print. The material is like that scuba swimwear material which makes it easy to wipe off if you get something on it. I would’ve given it five stars if it had something to hold the shape in the bottom of the bag otherwise it just collapses when you’re trying to pack it
NEG 	The product is very good quality. I am taking one star off due to its high price.
NEG 	I purchased this to take on vacation to a cabin up in the mountains. Rentals never have good knives. This did the job. The knives were sharp and seemed to be sturdy. The only detractor is that the case and knives are very large, and the case is quite cheap and not very user friendly.
NEG 	Beautiful colors. I did have to velcro to keep it on the bar. It had a bigger area where the bar goes in and the wind sends it flying off.
NEG 	Was a little too thick for my Car seat as intended I’m short and it pushed me too far toward steering wheel for my liking, however works well on my recumbent style exercise bike.
NEG 	Love the lenses! My only issue is that with the telephoto lens, I can still see a dark circle around my photos no matter how much I try to center it. But can't complain too much. Lenses are great!
NEG 	Fast shipping and love it! The blade felt a little dull but that was easily fixed, hence why I didn't give it five stars. Satisfied with this product overall!
NEG 	After reading the cookbook I am grateful for some of the designations provided by the editor. Certain recipes are indicated as light or fast to prepare. I do not want this, so I turned to this book. Thanks to the book, I learned how to balance myself pH, through which I can lose weight, fight fatigue, improve digestion and increase energy. The book is written very easily and understandably. Thanks to the author for the useful information.
NEG 	This item has great sound. I wish the base as a little deeper though. When turned up to the max it gets a little distorted, but it is seriously loud! Overall a good purchase...
NEG 	A fun game that gets you hooked. Takes some practice and as you gain experience it gets easier. Update January 9, you get to a point where several of the tank upgrade features do no work. Gets kind of frustrating and you can't upgrade and no real help file to go to.
NEG 	A lot of people compliment my shoes. They definitely stand out!
NEG 	Helpful for quick plan sight seeing needs. Not really helpful planning a place to eat. Great maps, very helpful.
NEG 	Lasted exactly 2 years. Not bad for the priced. Will buy again.
NEG 	They are a nice glass I use for coffee. No problems so far putting them in the microwave to reheat the coffee
NEG 	I’m not really sure what everyone’s problem is with these chairs. I was hesitant to purchase them because of the poor reviews but for the price, I took a chance. There was absolutely no difficulty putting them together. I did use wood glue as recommended by previous review. The holes lined up and they’re sturdy. They’re great.
NEG 	Works as intended but I had something similar before that turned off my iPad when you closed it. This one does not do that so my iPad is often dead when I go to use it because I forget to shut it off. Really missing that feature and will probably go back to the other product because of it.
NEG 	This is a good piano for 3 to 5 years old kids. It is small in size and kids can play it easily. The build quality could have been better.
NEG 	Such a feel-good story. I would have given it five stars, but (I can't believe I'm going to write this because I just love a sexy story), the numerous sex scenes slowed down the plot for me. Three or four would have been enough, but this reader got interrupted with more than eight (pun intended). The main characters were likeable enough and hard-working so I didn't begrudge them their fun. However, the plot did seem a little thin and wrapped up too neatly. No matter, it was an enjoyable read, good escapism fare.
NEG 	I buy them for my business then get them printed up at my local lids. Between price, comfort, speed of delivery and most important my company color is recommend to everyone
NEG 	I wanted an inexpensive costume to wear while taking my child trick or treating. This worked great. I liked the head piece. The material is not very thick, but I didn't expect it to be so I wore a black shirt and some leggings under it. I thought it ran a bit small. I am usually a size small in regular clothes but I ordered this in a medium just to be sure and it fit me well. Overall it was definitely worth the money for a Halloween costume that I planned to wear one time.
NEG 	Perfect size for the desk are a, easy to read
NEG 	This is a good coffee. Not great, but quite good. It appears to be freshly-roasted and has a nice taste. I will probably buy it again. I'm no coffee snob, and this coffee is a good price and I am quite satisfied.
NEG 	Very pretty but too small. I tried to return it but the seller wouldn’t take it back. They did credit my account which was very thoughtful.
NEG 	Awesome light but the switch button has a glitch. Sometimes you have to tap the unit for it to turn on; makes hunting a little more challenging. Solid body, animals are recognizable easily at 100 yds.
NEG 	I DO like these 'lids'. The design is ingenious. Kudos to the inventor/developer. PROS Fits the tab perfectly Aids in lifting tab Convenient 'always on' Will reduce spillage CONS Will not contain carbonation Will not contain spillage Does not inspire confidence in opening can Possible injury to thumb when opening can All that said, some context is in order. Initially, I was looking for something to contain the carbonation for cans left in the fridge overnight, and reduce some slight uneasiness about nearby science projects easing death into my soft drinks. These looked very simple, and though pricey at eight USD, I appreciated the clever design. Ordered even though I realized these were not intended for my use case. The work very well for their intended use, and fairly well for mine, as noted above. There is only one caveat, for which I deducted one star. (I usually don't give the fifth star until I observe a high level of durability over time. That was not this case though.) The width of the two 'tines' that encircle the tab actually *impeded* opening the can. They press on the surface of the can that doesn't open. You're instructed to press on the tab with your thumb while pulling up on the back of the Barricade. On two cans my thumb went into the opening somewhat. There were no cuts, but I can see that as a possibility, unless maybe you have wide meaty digits. Using the device to try to open the can gave me the impression it could snap at any second. I found it much easier to open the tab as I always do, then attach the Barricade afterwards. For anybody who has trouble lifting the tab, using the Barricade to lift the tab up enough to grab it without the device might be a better way to go. Aside from the price, I'd recommend these for their intended purpose. I'll get full caps for overnight storage in the fridge, but I really like these guys for daily use. They work well enough for me and possibly better for others.
NEG 	As others wrote...no instructions, but can find pics online and assemble just fine.
NEG 	My kids love doing these but not many pages at all.
NEG 	I just received the product today. First impressions are good. The smell is pleasant and not over powerfull. The bottle is smaller than expected for the price but will be worth it if it’s as good as they claim.
NEG 	The product is great but I wasn’t able to cut to fit my stove. I passed them on to my mother where they worked great for her stove.
NEG 	This product was very easy to install, but unlike the OEM, this does NOT include the nut to secure the new antenna mast. If you are missing that nut, you may have to check a junkyard or figure out some other solution, as that nut is not available as a standalone aftermarket product. Minus one star for the mismatch between the OEM inventory and what this ships.
NEG 	It works all you do is point and click. I ordered two one stopped working but it was only 6 bucks so worth it
NEG 	These installed just as the OEM motors. They come with new rubber seals but they did not have integrated strainers on the seals like comes from the factory so I just reused my original seals with strainers. They appear just as the OEM but are obviously a knock off as they do not have any markings to indicate part number or manufacturer.
NEG 	I was looking forward to this magnet set. I was surprised to find out they required assembly. It's simple enough to put together, it's only 3 pieces, but it took unexpected time and didn't include any instructions. My set was missing a washer which took my count to 9 magnets
NEG 	Work just fine. Throat is a little smaller than I expected but it works.
NEG 	I still am out on a final verdict, but I can comment to what I've noticed over the last month. First, and most important, this pillow keeps your head flat with the rest of you. There is no propping up at any angle with this one. That said, I feel the position is natural and comfortable when on my back. My old pillows always left my head tilted up slightly when on my back so it took time to accept that this new position was good. Maybe it's more mental than physical? My other comment is that I sleep on my side a lot. The support under my neck doesn't feel like it is there. Maybe I should get the firmer pillow to see if that does better - could be my size. I also wonder if it's me and the introduction to a totally new type of pillow makes it seem like there's not enough support for side-sleeping. I can say the amount of neck pain in the past few mornings seemed to have diminished. Still some lingering, but no where near what I had before. Took a few mornings to get to this place and so far I'm pretty happy. Would I buy another pillow like this, yes. I actually will buy the firmer one at some point to see if my hunch is right. For now I continue to use the pillow and I have been sleeping well.
NEG 	Love the clear. LOVE that it protects the corners. Had one come with the phone. Very nice but the corners were exposed and with me that is always where it lands if I drop it.
NEG 	I like this table cloth, I just wish it was a bit more water resistant. It'd make small spills or coffee drips easier to spot clean.
NEG 	Very soft and comfortable, this dress fit perfectly. I am medium/large at the moment and ordered the large. The arms weren’t too tight and my belly has plenty of room while the dress still looks fitted
NEG 	Use a splatter guard the first time you try it so you can test out what works for your microwave. First time I used it I just cracked an egg and did 40 seconds. Egg splatter everywhere inside the microwave cause it burst from the bottom. The second time we did 35 seconds and it worked perfectly. Easy to clean with a dish sponge by hand.
NEG 	Very cute design for both the base and the controller. Soft touch silicon. Good vibration strength. Decent range on the controller. I only wish you could jump to different functions without having to cycle through them all. Still happy overall.
NEG 	I like the glass container and the sizes .. not to crazy about the lids... they should snap Better
NEG 	Really cute, but it stinks a bit. I will have to try to wash it and I hope that turns out well. It looked way smaller than I expected when I got it, but like the TARDIS it seems bigger on the inside and holds a decent amount of stuff. Construction is sturdy also. Overall a really good buy for the price minus the mildew smell.
NEG 	Several sellers have this some in bigger ornament size or slight difference in charm and font. I choose this seller specifically for the font style which is very classy and goes with the movies theme. The only thing I can say that I would have changed was the bell being more finished and tuned to the one in the movie, that would be incredibly impressive and I would pay twice the price for it. Still a beautiful ornament.
NEG 	Too hot to wear to work when it's not winter. But great for colder weather. Comfy. Not too thick.
NEG 	I wanted a medium size bag to carry when i do day or weekend trips one i can wear hands free and not worried about the bag falling off my shoulder. This was a good purchase for me nice leather and a good price.
NEG 	Easy to wear, but the stiff part of the velcro digs into my arm. I haven't felt relief yet, hoping to soon!
NEG 	I love fox hats. However they always come in a little tight and need stretching in over time. After they stretch out they are awesome!
NEG 	Very pretty but came with two large sections of scratches as if done by a machine. CZs are pretty and all are intact. Shiny and comfortable. Decided to keep since price is reasonable. Will update if stones fall out.
NEG 	Great price and good selection. They only thing I’d recommend is ordering in cool weather because the chocolates arrived a little melted.
NEG 	4 stars because it looks more like yellow than gold
NEG 	My 15 month old puppy loves this food. Very expensive but worth it. Discovered the food I was feeding her had high levels of Glyphosate. Have had several rescue dogs die of cancerous tumors even though my yard has never had chemicals sprayed.
NEG 	Very good movie to watch. DC comic movies are good.
NEG 	Not cheaply made. Keep it in yer pocket for when you have to tame that mane!
NEG 	Not what I usually read but a good change of pace. If you like lots of action with military hardware this is for you. I will most probably read more of the series. Recommended.
NEG 	Works, used it to cover area that used to have wallpaper. Covers about one wall in a living room if using a roller. Did not have much luck using a paint brush, pretty thick.
NEG 	seal does come off after washing it! still great for take-out food. very large, 2 portions easily fit.
NEG 	Just okay not quite as smooth as other ones
NEG 	The mop lays flat and has an extension wand to dry or wet mop under the bed, large dresser, and TV media cabinet to remove the dust that accumulates. I have to bend over or get down on the floor, but the mop fits all the way to the end of the bed / furniture when mopping from the other end. The microfiber head is large enough to clean underneath the bed without having to make too many passes.
NEG 	I bought this dinosaurs set for my niece since she is so interested in dinosaurs now. The backpack is the most part I like it’s cute, light and has a good quality it’s so convenient to take the toys anywhere or when kids finish playing they can put them together in the backpack, this is so smart idea to sell the toy with the bag. The dinosaurs are great but some of them can’t stand (I found 3 can’t) when I take them out of the plastic bag it has a little plastic smell so I’d suggest you to leave them for a while before playing but if you don’t they are fine. The sticker and fluorescents are great too especially the fluorescents glow very well in the dark. This set is good for the price.
NEG 	I like it a lot. Perfect near one of my corner windows. It could be a little taller. Three to four inches perhaps. Sincerely...
NEG 	I like these prima paints a lot but was expecting this one to be a little more vibrant than it is. It's kind of chalky or dull when it dries but it still works great in my art journal or on a canvas.
NEG 	I like that they are lightweight but the medium size tongs stick, when you open and close them the component that supports the function have to be pushed more than once .. no issues with the other sizes they function fine..
NEG 	My new cat is finicky, but through this little sampler, I discovered his favorites (pate)
NEG 	This basket is fairly delicate but if it's going to be in a shelf or in one spot is unbeatable for the price. It's also a little smaller than I expected but I'm sure it says the dimensions somewhere and I didn't read it well. All in all its really not bad. But
NEG 	The wife really digs the glitter, and the case provides pretty good coverage. I don't know how it protects in a drop from three feet on the corner of the phone. Haven't yet installed the screen protector.
NEG 	It was for a 2 y.o. Boy who plays with his sisters. It was appropriate!
NEG 	Works perfect. Honestly slightly tighter than even I prefer. But it's solid and it makes the keys stay in place. Not going anywhere. Most people think I'm carrying around a flute or something LOL.
NEG 	It is really comfortable, but it is HUGE. We have a queen size bed and it takes up half of it. My Husband jokes that now we have separate beds. Very comfortable though.
NEG 	Surprisingly enough, the things I didn't think I like about this story are the things that made it memorable. So many negative, snooty, and grumpy characters actually made this an unusual story and kept everyone on the suspect list. Entertaining, yes, and especially looking back. Enjoy!
NEG 	The hanger is sturdy enough for a 50' hose. It doesn't come with any screws or anchors for the install though, so you'll need to buy them seperately. But once you have the hardware it's easy enough to install. So far so good!
NEG 	Work’s great, real cute,but pretty expensive and coming from Russia,there just buttons glued onto a magnet.
NEG 	Much bigger and more cumbersome than expected. It seems like it would work great, though, if you needed to bring a case of wine under a plane. It also seems to be good quality. I haven't used mine and expect to return it because it is so large and would be difficult for me to maneuver.
NEG 	I am very happy with the Bark Collar from ibuddy. I have a 7-year-old yellow labrador retriever that is a great dog just one little issue, since I moved to a new home she continually has barked at everything around. I purchased the bark collar a few days ago and immediately put it on to see if we could have some peace around the house again. After the first bark, she learned quickly that this may not be the best thing to do again and I only had it on the first setting.
NEG 	These are well made and soft. No worries about them scratching paint.
NEG 	Because nothing's perfect.
NEG 	Party play boy Jase. Always playful life of the party. NO one takes him serious. Will he change his ways? Can he get the girl that catches his eye & mind? Ellen the single mom who always does what needs to be doing for her son. Works hard everyday and never lets a man in to hurt her. Will she take a chance to love again?
NEG 	I thought I'd save myself time getting the version of Windows on a flash drive, but the install failed over and over and I ended up downloading and creating my own install media anyway. Product key worked fine. I'm dinging the "easy to install" category only because if the unusable install device. Once I made my own everything went smoothly.
NEG 	Color indicators for wet or dry, they work great but are a little pricey.
NEG 	Very nice, comfortable at a good price.
NEG 	Good for light / moderate dirt given softer bristles versus other really firm finger / hand brushes. May be fine with hand cleaner for tougher jobs or sensitive skin and nails. Good price for 4. Using one for saddle soaping boots.
NEG 	I've had a Grill Daddy for years and just recently had to replace the original one I had. I don't find much need for the straight front brush, but the main area of the brush works fine for me. The steam feature works well in my opinion. I've never had a problem with bristles coming off, just wearing down.
NEG 	Very sturdy but hard to close...
NEG 	I love the rack itself, but those stick-on labels are terrible. They should offer some metal stick-on labels with better adhesive at extra cost or something. Aside from that I love these rails.
NEG 	It works but it should be a little brighter.
NEG 	Daughter loves hanging smaller ones on here between pet nets.
NEG 	This product works well for subtle sustained energy. It does a good job of helping keep calm in stressful situations.
NEG 	We bought this for our niece to use. It is super helpful to keep the baby supported. We love the little extra pillow that is included, it helps to prop him up. The included carrying bag is also great.
NEG 	It was what I wanted to decorate my grander room for christmas
NEG 	Runs a little lean, will split back through the carb when opening throttle occasionally. Only minor mixture adjustment needed to run well. Like that it came with an extra bowl gasket.
NEG 	I ordered two of these cases, one for 9.7 iPad and one for 8.0 Samsung S2 . They fit & unfold perfectly. They come with a stylus pen which is mediocre at best. I would order these again
NEG 	Product is great, it definitely runs small so order a size up! Very soft and warm
NEG 	So far works well and has been relatively easy to clean. No problems with it containing any water from wet items. I do wish it came with more colors and sizes.
NEG 	Quality is good, specs as specified
NEG 	It is pretty, however, I only gave it a 4 star because, of the sizeing. This ring runs one whole size off. If you wear a size 6 then by all means order a size 7. It does not look like diamonds maybe because, it is not diamonds but, as for costume jewelry it is nice. Will it turn at some point? Probably but, check the price you get what you pay for. All in all not a bad ring.
NEG 	It seems like it works. my whole ps4 doesn't feel hot like usuall does before I bought the product . One problem is the off/on button for the fan seems to be mis-align And kind have to push the corner of the button to turn it on. But so far what I really love is that it comes with three extra us ports
NEG 	I ordered a extra size larger than I wear,to account for shrinking.I'm glad I did. They still fit nice,I'm satisfied with them.
NEG 	It looks great but had a wiggly leg
NEG 	Love these, not quite as comfy as my Hawaiian made equivalents but much more affordable and more comfortable then the thin reefs, recommended.
NEG 	Super comfy but the neck hole is way bigger than it needs to be. I returned for this reason as it just didn’t lay right on my broad shoulders. It’s otherwise a cute comfy oversized sweater
NEG 	It's pretty cute. But not quite. I don't think it can be used during baby sleeping time.
NEG 	It's like a little whip and it stings like heck.
NEG 	They hold up rather nicely
NEG 	I have been using this for about a week now, it does seem to be helping. My feet aren't nearly as rough. The cream is smooth and it is relaxing to use as well.
NEG 	Good quality but I definitely thought it came with a pillow
NEG 	Love the bar, but wish it was a little bigger.
NEG 	Absolutely precious and my three year old adores it all! They're so soft and the house they come in is adorable! The pups are small enough to fit in an adult's palm and for perfectly in a three year old's hand. They're large enough that they pose absolutely no threat of choking. The only downside is the door is fastened with two little straps but so far they have withstood my three year old, so it's not terrible.
NEG 	They fit the keys well and are bright. Material isn't the most durable so we will see how long they last.
NEG 	Smaller than I realized it would be but my art students love it.
NEG 	My granddaughter loved it.
NEG 	Great set of beginner beads or addition to everyday beads, in a nice little box with polishing cloth. They look and feel great!
NEG 	what can i say.... SKITTLES
NEG 	Cute, nice light (we already had a similar night light so we wanted something to go in the other child's room), but the eyeballs fell out almost immediately when we started to charge it. We couldn't get it right back in the eye hole and when trying to push it back in, the eye went inside the light. It is a functional light but the little eyes falling off is a concern for me with smaller children who may pick them up and accidentally put it in their mouths.
NEG 	I was holding up all of my nursing books with two big blocks of granite from our basement, but this shelf works much better. It is totally full up with big textbooks, so not a small job, and it shows no signs of strain or that it might ever break. Lightweight, but the construction is sturdy enough to hold real books!
NEG 	I enjoyed reading this book and will read it again. It seems like a great study guide. At 70 years old I need a study guide to keep me on track.
NEG 	I had it for about a month and the plastic broke
NEG 	The extension belt was missing. So do I get money off
NEG 	Nice tool added to my toolbox
NEG 	Good value. I live in a windy area with my garden flags. I have gone through several of the flower shaped stops in the past. I just wanted to get some replacements that did not cost an arm and a leg because I am sure I will lose a few more.
NEG 	I like the pattern. Easy enough to work on. But it wasn't 18 inches. More like 16.
NEG 	These are really comfy and soft. Love to just lounge around in them at home. Only thing is that I’m a 32 waist, but the medium was a little large on me. I have to use the strings to tighten a little. If I knew, I would have gone for the small.
NEG 	Diffuses oils really well but does humidify a bedroom well.
NEG 	I really enjoy these headphones. They aren't necessarily noise canceling but they definitely block out what my roommate is trying to tell me. One issue is that when they are playing loud music, people can hear it a bit but also you're not suppose to play music that loud anyway. I don't use the bluetooth function much (I prefer wires over having to charge items) and every time a sound was made there was a beep at the beginning and I'm not sure if that's my user error or the headphones but they are great for the price. I did think they were a little tight at the beginning, wearing them for a long time would start to hurt my head, but after a while it seemed the plastic started to give a little more and so its much more comfortable now.
NEG 	Not an expert here but these work great for me on my system.
NEG 	So far, so good! No issues, easy to apply and comes with enough supplies for all 5 screen protectors to be used. There are instructions included if needed and the screen protectors come well packaged!
NEG 	Comfortable, my almost everyday shoes. Shoes are slightly long and my heal rubs. No blisters, but liner is showing wear.
NEG 	Am 5'7", 170 lbs and normal size is Medium but based on recommendations in prior reviews, I downsized to a Small and it fits like a modern/tailored fit.
NEG 	It works as expected.
NEG 	have used it for years; it does prevent a puppy from going after everything.
NEG 	Jack works great for 100 bucks however the packaging was torn to bits and one of the bolts that act as the brake was bent during shipping. I cannot contact the seller to get a partial refund so I’m writing this review. But wouldn’t change the fact that I’d buy this product again if I had to.
NEG 	I can't believe the price of this set, given the quite nice furniture that you get for it! I looks great and performs just perfectly! It came in many (some heavy) boxes, and fortunately our set only got 2 tiny blemishes that are not visible from the front (a little scratch and a little dent on the inside face of one drawer). It was fairly easy to put together, all you have to do is follow the instructions. But since the instructions are only graphics, I can see how some people would have a more difficult time with it. However, I want to stress is not hard at all. It is time consuming though. I would like to see manufacturers find a different packing material than styrofoam, because little particles of the stuff gets stuck EVERYWHERE and it's a pain to clean. Also it's not environmentally friendly and can't be recycled. Other than that, we are very happy with this set and you can seriously NOT beat that price!!
NEG 	So far this unit works great for chia seeds. The only complaints I have for the unit is the coarse/fine adjust knob is tricky to use so as not to damage the milling cones, which the instructions say will happen if the unit is operated without seeds. But can happen even with seeds, at the start of milling, if the knob is set too fine, before the seeds actually enter the milling cone. The method I use to prevent this, is to set the knob to a coarser setting, then start milling to get the seeds into the mill cone, discard this material. Then start turning to finer settings as the crank is operated. This way, the stainless steel milling cone teeth will never come in contact with each other, thereby damaging them, as the seed material is acting as a barrier. Still, I would recommend this item.
NEG 	I had hoped to achieve a lighter color but I have grown to like the color and am satisfied with the finished product.
NEG 	I bought this watch for my nephew. So far it seems like a great durable watch. The light is not as bright as pictured. Nice watch that gets the job done in telling time and date.
NEG 	this item works fine as expected the only reason I don't give all the stars is because the hose drips a little water after I close the faucets for a little while
NEG 	I like it but it was too heavy
NEG 	Great smart watch. Definitely exceeded my expectations based on the previous reviews. The lack of battery time has not been a problem. I get a entire days usage out of the watch and usually have about 25-30% battery by 11:00 P.M. and I take it off the charger at 6:30 A.M. Just wish it was slightly more intuitive to use.
NEG 	fits well, but doesn't cover through the curves of the face. you can see the edges
NEG 	Quality product, Nice couples gift. We wear them all the time when we miss each other, we look down and think of our other half :)
NEG 	Looks good 2nd one I purchased
NEG 	Picture is obviously better than actual product but it is an OK skirt. Fabric is not the best.
NEG 	so far it looks good......obviously plastic so lid was a slight challenge to install and doesn't shut tight without lock (keeping it locked for a few days to see if it helps keep it down).....may be a bit pricey for plastic..........will fit in between a table and wall perfectly in our kitchen.....great design for our needs
NEG 	Looks as though they will work fine. Too difficult for me to put together
NEG 	Cute- smaller than expected, but great for kiddies!
NEG 	There is a major (to me) difference between the twill shorts and the denim shorts. I'm including both reviews here Twill: If you love the slacks, you will love these shorts as well. Very well designed cargo pockets are perfect for all smartphones. Denim: Instead of two well designed cargo pockets it only comes with one (left pocket). The right pocket is a normal, average design cargo pocket. If you only carry your smartphone in your left cargo, this is fine, but you won't have the same option with the other pocket for some reason. Apparently if you review two similar items here only the first sticks. This updated review is meant to fix this.
NEG 	I carry this and my bypass pruners with me on all of my gardening adventures. The knife is sturdy and can take some abuse. It digs, saws, cuts, slashes, etc. No looseness in the handle after a month+ of regular use. Sharpened it with a whetstone after a few weeks and seems to be staying sharp. The serrated edge is pretty aggressive and is great for getting through grass, roots, etc. I was holding back at first but it seems very tough so I've got no concerns about using it hard. The sheath is cheap vinyl, not leather. Mine was ok but I got a leather sheath with a pruner pouch and belt clip that I like a lot better.
NEG 	It kept my interest.
NEG 	Does what it supposed to do
NEG 	I was scared to buy towels without feeling them first, but they are soft and comfortable. Love getting out of the shower and wrapping up in one. The only issues is the fuzziness. I've washed them a few times, but still have the issue.
NEG 	This toy is not really a "learning" toy. My daughter has been wanting one for a while so I finally got her one for her birthday and she likes it a lot.
NEG 	They are super cute and just like the picture!! How ever there is no padding for your foot and the toe box is actually to tall. I am normally a 9.5 but ordered the 10 and they fit comfortably.
NEG 	4 stars because putting it together was a bit tricky, but once assembled seems very sturdy and my dog likes sitting on it. My dog is a 50lb mutt, around 2" tall at the shoulder, could've ordered a size down but she likes to stretch out so the large size works for her
NEG 	Why does the delivery man think , just because he takes a picture of it in front of my door , I'm definitely going to get it??
NEG 	My son loves these rival guns,but they get jammed a lot.
NEG 	First time using something like this and found it quite simple. I plan to find more designs to play with now.
NEG 	This was exactly what I was shopping for and at a reasonable price. Delivery was much faster than expected. Very satisfied.
NEG 	Good quality, view is unique. Very good if you use eye glasses. Very good eye relief distance with a Celestron C8 SCT
NEG 	They need help with the look of these gloves but besides that they are a great deal. Padding is soft and sticky and the finger support seems well built. I just received them but so far so good. You wont be looking very stylish but you'll be making saves....
NEG 	this is well-designed and steady glasses, however, I have to return it because of polarized lens. it is not used to me, very hard to see properly.
NEG 	Started a little slow or unbelievable but with time became more plausible once you got to know the characters.
NEG 	Looks like it came with the truck, fits perfect
NEG 	Amazing for the price! I get compliments all the time. You don’t want to trek all over the world with them unless you put inserts but for work they’re perfect!
NEG 	The item is much better than the picture shows. i like it. the only thing is to hope it can be thicker.
NEG 	Nice bag daughter loves it. Could you a pouch for her water bottle. The side zip Pockets are too small for her current water bottle.
NEG 	I have used these several times for both weekend and longer trips since I purchased these 6 months ago. I like that I can keep things organized, which makes unpacking easier, and that I can have a bag for shoes/dirty clothes. One zipper has started to give a little bit, which is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars.
NEG 	The nightgown was very comfortable to sleep in, but fell apart after a couple of washes!
NEG 	Very pretty and sturdy! The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because the piping around the case is peeling off but it doesn’t effect the durability of the case.
NEG 	We received new lights for this company and very happily changed our rating based on service. Our first rating was as following “Got two strings! Only around 5 bulbs worked out of both! I do not recommend this item..”
NEG 	All plastic build but solid none the less. Like the small size on my counter but admittedly I've rapped my knuckle on the edge of it a couple times when knocking the spent puck out of my espresso filter. So one star off for that. Overall happy with the purchase.
NEG 	Seems fine but as others have said Shrimp will not use this, but they do! You can attach moss and have a mound. Update: Shrimp are using this, however turned from the dark color to rust color within a few days. Very concerning as to what is leeching into my water.
NEG 	Very soft, perfect for the beach.
NEG 	Very stylish set. Giving it as a gift.
NEG 	Not bad but I'll probably not reorder.
NEG 	Sent as a gift. She loved it
NEG 	The boots seem well built. Had a pair of pros b4 but the soles separated. Also the insoles are cheap. Bought some Dr Scholl insoles and a nice comfortable boot was had.
NEG 	All data what you have to think about passionate insight in this book gathering. Helpful and fascinating gain some new useful knowledge about control enthusiastic, investigate individuals and other intriguing exercises.
NEG 	Did what I needed it to do.
NEG 	So far so good, only thing I worry about is if it will rust over time.
NEG 	The product is excellent. The snap closure is tight, and it is amazing how many pills these small boxes will hold. I gave 4 stars because in 2 weeks the printing is rubbing off making it difficult for a user to know what to take. I tried using a sharpie pen to mark the box but even after cleaning lid with alcohol the sharpie mark rubbed off. I am going to try colored duct tape to label AM and see if this will stay on. I did not want to use a sticker because of cleanliness..
NEG 	Just place it on the stand and it charges like a plug-in, except it’s wireless. Quick and convenient and no more dealing with cords, looks neat wherever I place it.Love it!
NEG 	I carry this back and forth for my massage sessions. It's nice to keep my oils organized and fairly easy to wipe out if they leak a little in side the bag while transporting. Hard part is getting bottles out from the end slots. It's a tighter spot with the material to try to maneuver items in and out. Otherwise, I like the bag and other therapists have commented on it as well.
NEG 	The mini trampoline is great to jump in when you are in your room and I like that it fits nicely in my room. My siblings and friends enjoy jumping and bouncing on it. I don’t really like that to jump higher, you have to jump hard and it doesn’t feel that bouncy when you try jumping higher.
NEG 	All Crawford books have been a good read.
NEG 	easy read - interesting characters but by book 5 the author needs a better editor!!!
NEG 	More Narrow than the white ledge. I have been breaking them in for weeks. My second hike i wore these on I never experienced foot pain so bad from a shoe. I wore my flip flops and socks for the last 3 miles of my hike. I have wide feet. I ordered an 8. If you need them wider I’d buy Timberlands White Ledge boot. It’s much roomier. These have the same quality you can find in a Tim boot, but wide feet beware. I wouldn’t order these again, but I’ll wear them until they break because it’s too late to return them lol. I just won’t bring them on a hike longer than 2 hours.
NEG 	I really enjoyed this story of love, redemption, and rebuilding after devastating circumstances. Noah is such a beautiful character, and you can't help bit fall for the charm, romance, and protective attributes he portrays. Tabby's journey back to self is hopeful and makes her an endearing voice. The two together are magic.
NEG 	I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter for Christmas so I haven't used the item yet; however I opened it up to inspect it and to make sure the item was as expected. It kind of reminds me of a modern day etch-a-sketch, I loved using mine as a child and I hope that my granddaughter enjoys drawing and doodling on this just a s much. I believe that this item will perform exactly as expected giving her hours of fun because you can use this item straight out of the box; however, I am a tiny bit concerned about the durability of the tablet. I know that it is designed with small children in mind; however, I am very nervous that may not hold up to really rough usage so I am searching now for some type of case to alleviate that fear. I am sure that I am probably being very paranoid but I just want make sure, time will tell. Honestly, I got this tablet at such a great value that I won't be terribly heartbroken either way. My granddaughter may feel differently however. LOL
NEG 	Bought these for my sister in law and she loves them!
NEG 	Not bad for the price. Folds in and out fairly easy. The only issue with mine is that it doesn’t quite like to fold around my rear view mirror (2016 VW Passat).
NEG 	This was a gift and the recipient was pleased.
NEG 	I really like the concept of an automatic feeder and it's extremely useful to have this dispense food at regular intervals throughout the day. That being said, this implementation just seems a bit... lacking. It's the absolute opposite of intuitive, and even though I consider myself quite tech-savvy, I still have to look at the manual to figure out how to do the most basic things. Most actions require holding down two small buttons at one time and pressing repeatedly, over and over, to get the value where you want. It's as if the creators did absolutely zero user testing or didn't focus at all on the actual experience of using this device, since most interactions are far more complex than they need to be. One other fairly major issue I have with the device is that if it's unplugged, all my settings seem to reset (which, as you can guess from what I said before, is quite annoying since resetting everything to the correct settings takes forever and is an absolute pain). This happens regularly since my cats move around the area and occasionally unplug the device, or if I lose power I have to redo everything. In the short period of time I've had the device, I've had to completely redo all the settings 3 times. Other than all that, the device works as expected and dispenses food if your settings are correct, which is why I'm still giving it the stars that I am: My cats do eat from it and it's made my life a lot easier. I just really wish there were some UI/UX improvements and the device was made more simple.
NEG 	I wanted a pair of leggings that I could wear while working out as well as for an everyday look. I absolutely love the material. It is not thin to where you can see through and they are super soft. They are warm to wear outside in the cooler weather. They are great to move with your body when you move. I also like that they are high waisted to hold it all in. I ordered a size medium and they fit great. The only issue I have is that the inner leg seam (crouch area) is not reinforced very well. I like more of a wider material are rather than just a single seam.
NEG 	Will not work on all phones.
NEG 	They were perfect and stayed intact during the mad Christmas/New Years travel.
NEG 	I thought, I like hazelnuts, so why not give this a try. Well, almond Snickers taste so much better. Even regular Snickers are better than these. just an opinion / matter of taste. But the rest of my family won't eat them.
NEG 	Pretty good for the money, took out the lumbar support, because I didnt need it. Is a little small, but think that was because I wasnt used to a good chair... so far am loving it!
NEG 	I purchased this to wear at my wedding. It looks very much like the photos, except the ones showing very white pearls. The pearls are definitely cream-colored. The bracelet sparkles and is very cute. As you can see in my photos though, my sparkles band was bent. It’s not so bad as to make it unwearable, but it is noticeable in some angles. I won’t return it, because otherwise it is great. My wrist is 6 inches exactly, and the smallest link is the perfect size. It can go big enough for me to slip it over my hand as well.
NEG 	This book started off slowly. Perhaps it was because it was translated from German. But, by the half-way point was reached, I was very much caught up in the story. The true sign of a good book is that it stays with you after the last page. I thought about the narrative for days after I finished it.
NEG 	Inner plastic piece broke while trying to disassemble but I had a similar product that work well with it.
NEG 	This mimic dice bag is really neat. For a real gamer, it's a great gift. I was hoping that it would be larger, but it will easily hold a D20 dice set. If you want something that will hold all of your dice, then this is not what you are looking for. But if you want a funny/cute way of keeping a set handy....This is what you are looking for.
NEG 	Strong scent that helped to remove odor, but the scent was very chemically smelling and doesn’t need to burn for very long.
NEG 	I bought a second Kindle and downloaded my favorite All in One Solitaire game. Although the games are the same, the layout and some rules have changed. I go and forth between the two Kindles from old to new one. I guess I just need to get used to the new look and rules.
NEG 	The product is pretty but the Beverly Oaks Certificate of Authenticity didn’t come as stated in description
NEG 	Pretty good quality for the price
NEG 	leave my skin feeling clean and smooth
NEG 	I use this kettle every day and recommend it to everyone!
NEG 	We love the packing cubes. Ordered as gifts too.
NEG 	Another great read by Lee Child’s. Jack Reacher is a terrific character and Mr. Child’s spins a great tale that keeps you thirsting for more.
NEG 	Good read but a little slow for me.
NEG 	It takes some practice to get it to work properly, but when you get it down it does a pretty good job. It's much more convenient than the tape rollers that you have to continually replace.
NEG 	Comfortable and cushiony. But thick and to warm for hot days.
NEG 	This is a very sturdy and versatile edger. I am very satisfied with this product.
NEG 	If you don't want a snug fit, consider getting the size bigger.
NEG 	I guess that for the price they ok not what I expected they are super small unless your plan is to send spr small items
NEG 	The flash cards are an easy and relatively quick way to master the different kinds of LSAT questions.
NEG 	Good water very refreshing. Can’t get over the look of it though.
NEG 	This is a great feeder and it does appear to keep the squirrels away. However my squirrels can top it to the side and spill the seed out sideways. If it was pole mounted from the bottom or had some sort of way to maintain balance they wouldn’t be able to get away with it!
NEG 	Looked beautiful. Covered all the phone. I purchased it in September, it lasted 8 months. Good for the price. The top cover hinged tab broke. Would not stay on.
NEG 	Nice glasses. Fit well
NEG 	Of course, love all the stuff this came with! Doing everything is easier and faster than my old Wacom Bamboo Create. Put simply, the only thing I don't like is the calibration. I can never seem to get it on point. No matter how many times I try to calibrate according to my best assumed optimal angles, the pen to the screen will always be off somewhere. The top side is perfectly on the pen, cool. The bottom side is responding a centimeter away from the pen, oh no. I recalibrate and now it's vise versa. I got it to something sort of manageable but still kinda bugs. Oh well, the pros still heavily outweigh the cons.
NEG 	Awsome decal, was a bit difficult to remove from the backing but i will definitely buy more.
NEG 	An excellent product, good quality watch band for the price, I recommended this product.
NEG 	Good deal. It’s sharp for now. When you first get you will have to use some strength to pull it out. Be very careful, watch your hands and make sure no one is around. After that it comes out pretty good.
NEG 	Good quality supplement
NEG 	It works fine but it's not 100 stable
NEG 	Good battery, little bit bigger, but it's shape give more air to the cooler.
NEG 	These eye pads work great! So glad I purchased them! (:
NEG 	I like that it feels comfortable
NEG 	Good design, works well.
NEG 	This was an impulse buy but I am so happy to have this candle! It smells great (fresh linen) and seems very high quality. Will purchase again!
NEG 	Product smells a little different than the original Biolage but it's still a good smell. Makes my hair feel thick and full. Shampoo doesn't lather as well as other brands but still serves its purpose.
NEG 	basic coin collecting folder
NEG 	Very soft and lightweight comforter that seems to be well made but it is still early. Daughter loves it and I love the price.
NEG 	They were too long. I gave them to a friend. She loves them. Kept her warm and dry snowboarding.
NEG 	Overall stroller seems durable but some of the plastic parts seem cheap. Our baby liked the stroller and normally hates everything. The biggest issue was that one of the snaps on the bottom mesh compartment came broken (today) and I am not sure how to get that replaced.
NEG 	I love the fact that it’s vegan! And has no bad smell to it like the other brands I have tried before which was coated with gelatin. Im only giving it 4 stars because I actually counted the capsules and I have received only 112 capsules rather than 120 capsules! So that’s annoying to be honest
NEG 	Beautiful Christmas lights in time for my seasonal decorating. Might even use them later for decorating my room.
NEG 	Perfect! Just as described. Puts a beautiful chrome finish on my nails. Would recommend. Comes with 9 chrome & 9 powder brushes. The more you use the more chrome effect you’ll get
NEG 	For the money I spent, it sounds adequate. It's easy to control and it fills my space with sound with ease. It's not the best sounding thing I've ever heard, but I don't think you could find anything better at this price.
NEG 	Cheaper to buy from them directly.
NEG 	This is a great product. It folds into a nice little light weight cylinder shaped piece that is easy to store and use whenever. My bike has kind of a weird frame so it's kind of hard to set it on the bike, but I just take it with me when I go on bike rides in my back pack just in case, and luckily it comes with a couple small patches for a quick fix if need be. Another nice thing is it comes with some car and motorcycle adapters but I dont really see myself using it for that. Would recommend.
NEG 	Have not had to use it yet, but fits great in bag.
NEG 	Everything but the muffin tin fits in my standard size toaster oven.
NEG 	Shower head is good for the price. If you want something inexpensive that gets the job done this should do. It really helped with my water pressure issue.
NEG 	An inspiration to the life Yeshua lived is still going strong today in His disciples.
NEG 	Exciting and page turning.
NEG 	I really studied the reviews on these things before I made this purchase. I had a hard time finding one that wasn't filled with fake reviews. This one at least seemed to have a few real reviews. Anyway, I purchased this for a trip I will be making in September. I want to listen to music on my phone while I'm at the beach, but don't want the battery to go dead while I'm doing it. So far I've charged this all the way up using a wall charger and that went well, and tested it on my cell phone. As a regular portable charger, it works great. Increased the battery by about 1% a minute, even while the phone was in use. It's very sturdy, and the light is super bright. I've walked into a sunny room with it and the lights came on indicating it was solar charging, but I haven't actually used it in the sun yet. I will update my review after I use it on the beach.
NEG 	Although Deepak is famous in his own way, he relates a down to earth narrative that is very much to the reader. Enjoyed it.
NEG 	Not the best labels but they are CHEAP CHEAP
NEG 	Helps me better than Tums
NEG 	The scarf combo is nice and warm.
NEG 	Not quite as good as brand name, but gets the job done at a lot less cost.
NEG 	The color of this is really classy and makes the Apple Watch look more appropriate for business wear than the original plastic strap. My only complaint is that this band is really long which makes it harder to fit properly on the wrist. Overall, very impressed!
NEG 	Very comfortable and good looking shoes.
NEG 	You get bang for your buck with this box set. Some errors throughout the various stories. Annoying more than anything. Couple stories were better than the others. Definitely worth a read.
NEG 	I liked it. If you've read Janet Evanovich, you know the style. The think I disliked was that it didn't end! You're left having to read the next in the series. Most series books do at least answer the questions posed in the book.
NEG 	This is a heavy duty cover that fit my weber grill perfectly. The only downside is that it is slightly lighter in weight than my previous cover.
NEG 	He has only built the robot so far
NEG 	The frying pan, while attractive, is not as durable as I thought based on the description. It seems to scratch much easier than I expected. Other than that it's fine.
NEG 	My son loves his cool sand. He likes the physics of it all. One drawback... The container arrived with one clip missing from the top so we can't carry by the handle on the lid. I had another container at home that we swapped. I didn't feel the need to return over mfgr defect.
NEG 	Fits perfectly not tight but for some reason my straps still be rolling even though it's broader straps. Plus size ladies it will fit 400lbs + and I rock the 5x and I am broad at the top
NEG 	The medium fits my 85lb Akita fine, but the large has the same size harness, just longer straps and it is really too small for a 115 lbs Akita. Still, he wears it and seems to be comfortable.
NEG 	decent does the job in our Motor Home
NEG 	The product is fine but the way it was advertised was deceptive I thought I was getting a dent pulling machine not a bunch of Dent pulling attachments
NEG 	so funny for gag gift, the little kids like fishing in the tub. its a win win
NEG 	Being self sufficient, I enjoy doing those things some men expect their wives to do. This kit is great for sewing on lost buttons and other minor repairs.
NEG 	Lot of fun. Sympathetic, likable characters. Plenty of action. Mysteries to unravel. Good series.
NEG 	Just bought a new car and bought some new accessories with this being one. I placed my 3 keys after some assembly and used the ring for my car key fob. They give you 2 different size screws in case you have more keys which will make it too thick for the standard screw being used. The leather is nice which seems like it will hold up for some time. Since it is a screw it is wise to check it every so often and give it a quick turn to tighten it. Moving you keys days loosens it out slightly, but still firm. It’s nice because now I can place my keys in my pocket and they are all neatly placed in the key holder. If you have other things in your pocket you don’t have to worry about keys digging you in your leg.
NEG 	A good Saturday afternoon read ..maybe too simple in its plot and a not so exciting finish.nice flow to the story nevertheless
NEG 	The clock is well designed and keeps good time.
NEG 	this cushion was recommended by my pt. wish the covering fit it better. it offers excellent spinal support and is comfortable to sit in.
NEG 	I love the look - it is beautiful - and so far (I've had it a couple of weeks) it protects my phone pretty well. I need my phone protected because, due to a medical issue, I drop my phone a lot. My only complaint is, when taking the plastic sleeve on and off over the rubber sleeve, the plastic sleeve seems to be very sharp. Not sharp enough to break the skin but enough to male it feel like it may have broken the skin. The other spot that is pretty sharp is on the right top corner where, on this phone (the LG STYLO 3 plus) where stylus is. But aside from those couple of sharp places, which I filled a bit by coating the edges with just a dab of clear nail polish, this is phone case looks nice and protects the phone great.
NEG 	I'm using these as a toy box for my dog. He loves them. Perfect hight. Sturdy enough.
NEG 	Love the jacket. I work outdoors all winter in new england so it gets cold but this and a thin hoodie underneath keeps me really warm. Got plenty of compliments from people as well. Only downside IMO is its a little bit large. I'm a small guy though 5'6" 135lbs and its a little bit bulky on me. I wear a thin hoodie underneath and it fits much better. Tl;dr: Pros: Great jacket, warm, everyone loves it. Cons: Slightly larger than expected, wouldve loved the slimmer look.
NEG 	Very nice set. Perfect for our beach themed room. Material does wrinkle easily so be prepared for it not to stay perfect but overall I’m happy with the quality and style of this bedding
NEG 	Awesome material not to thin or or too thick shows your curves
NEG 	I am looking forward to using this cookbook to prepare healthy meals for my spouse and me. I would like to hear from anyone who has substituted dairy milk for alternatives, like coconut, almond, or cashew.
NEG 	This product is pretty decent. Makes for cute picture perfect lunches for my kids! The lid is a little trouble. I haven’t put it in the dishwasher like it reccomends but it seems a little pesky at times. However overall very pleased with the product.
NEG 	Loved the chair covers. They served their purpose well.
NEG 	Hard to get this filter through Sears. Great to get it through Amazon!!!
NEG 	Wish the bottom was sturdier, worry it won't hold up to time or cleaning but otherwise, great quality and so soft.
NEG 	A good copy of the same case I had before, which lasted for a long time and worked great. This one appears to be of a similar make and fits well. Too soon to say if it'll last as long or not.
NEG 	Just buy them! They don't take up too much space. They have a some look. They sound great. And they are priced great! Go, Go, Go!
NEG 	This vinyl takes a while to transfer (of all the vinyl I’ve bought I have to iron this the longest) but the color is super vibrant on dark material and I love the texture, it doesn’t have that weird shine some brands have and is nice and matte looking, like paint
NEG 	This is my second cup turner that I purchased from Amazon. Much sturdier and the foam to hold the cups is much more versatile. I would definitely recommend.
NEG 	Looks better than the pictures. Works over glasses. Lightweight but effective
NEG 	Will not ignite. Have to return it. I will order another and change my rating if the new one works. Update : the new one lights just fine after I fiddled with the adjustment (it still will not light if I follow the instructions!) Have not had a chance to use it yet but it does ignite.
NEG 	It works fine for lifting objects that are up to a few pounds, but the pulley mechanism (basically thin braided wire) breaks off when heavier objects are lifted. This is my third purchase.
NEG 	I am so happy to have read this book. I now understand and respect Senator McCain even more than before.
NEG 	WOW! Love it! The coconut smells is awesome! It looks like you have this wonderful glow! I’ve had quite a few sun cancer spots taken off my back so no sun for me! This product is so much better than a spray tan!
NEG 	I bought it to have the camera hole in the right place so I don't have to remove the tablet from its cover. I also liked the flap that held the tablet in place.
NEG 	I like good case for the money
NEG 	Would’ve given it 5 stars but the light it came with broke immediately and there was no backup
NEG 	I've been buying this model for years. My last one started leaking water into it. But I take into ocean, hot tub, shower, diving. The features are great. One look gives you time, day and date. The leather strap tends to smell after getting wet. I put on my silicone strap instead.
NEG 	Dependable, light face cream. More bang for your buck than those pricey little tubes and jars.
NEG 	Easy to install. Wanted a safe product to warm chickens in colder temps...This is a set it and forget it safe product to use. Definitely need to be right next to it to feel warmth. ...so don't get if you're thinking this will warm a large area.
NEG 	Love the size of this rice cooker. I took off a star because the recipe book contains recipes that are almost impossible to make in the rice cooker and either boil over or you make a complete mess trying to mix well ingredients into an over flowing pot
NEG 	works as expected. material is very thin compared to past herb bags i have owner. worried that will shorten life of this product.
NEG 	We love this collar, but after less than a year, the fabric loop that holds the tags broke. We lost our tags. We will be contacting the company.
NEG 	Smaller then expected, but they did say 2 inch. There was 2 styles. Didn't get the same number if each. That's why I didn't give 5 stars.
NEG 	I like it ! I’m 5’3 , 150 with 32DDD boobs and the large did me well. The bottoms come all the way to like your chest . There’s only a lil skin showing between the top and be bottom but it’s still sexy .
NEG 	Interesting concept. Well executed. Good acting. Not overly deep.
NEG 	I enjoyed the way they led you on a hunt for the real killer , I can usually figure it out which I hate ..had me going till the very end . And one surprise really got me . So yes I’d recommend it.
NEG 	The premise is good. The characters are excellent. The story was great! It just took way too long to tell it. I understand background is needed, but not so much.
NEG 	serves my purpose for using it.
NEG 	Ok, so the boots them self are amazing! So far, I think good quality, will keep my feet warm and dry. However, I have larger calves and although they lace up (fully functioning laces) they just don’t have enough ‘give’ to make it look right. They fit! I’m gonna keep them to do their job, but I’m not a fan of how they really are meant for a smaller calf.
NEG 	Works very well and shuts tight. I used it everyday to make sure I drink enough water but it cracked and leaked in my bad after about 10 months of use. I would have liked to continue using it for much longer, but it satisfied my needs. I may buy another one in the future.
NEG 	The beads were easy to install but I ran into a problem with the supplied valve cores not seating in the stem far enough. I had to reuse my old valve core to inflate my tires. I would definitely buy these again each time I change tires but get yourself a supply of valve cores and just buy the beads by themselves.
NEG 	This high chair is perfect for my little home. It fits my big chunky boy and it's easy to use.
NEG 	Was perfect for my friend
NEG 	Works like the original.
NEG 	I love the format of this book with the rule pages that explain what will be reviewed and gives examples. However, I don't feel there are enough practice pages to truly review the concepts (3 per concept) so you would have to supplement, as needed. I plan to use the Language Fundamentals books first in order to teach important concepts and then follow up with this one later on. You can never go wrong with Evan-Moor products!
NEG 	I really like this quilt! It is lightweight and the print was very pretty.
NEG 	Works as intended nothing special,good price though
NEG 	It did great love my new waist trainer
NEG 	Great case, but the rubber has already started coming off.
NEG 	does what it is meant to
NEG 	Granddaughter was happy with this for her pretty bedroom.
NEG 	The top is removable which i dislike but all together a great piece !
NEG 	I like the style and the type of fabric. I will order a bigger size, because the one that I ordered did not fit well.
NEG 	Hard to put together. Directions where non existent for the netting. It is durable though.
NEG 	This is made with soft material that makes it comfortable to wear. I wear this only in the house with my slippers or socks on. It is uncomfortable with shoes on, it is too tight for me. Overall, it does the job.
NEG 	It is really a lot bigger than I planned on (but that is not the products fault), also the inside materials catches on the zipper.
NEG 	Very well made, especially for the price. Nice quality. Runs just a bit smaller than you might expect. Size up knowing it needs to fit over other clothes.
NEG 	Doesn’t stay stretched out but does the job.
NEG 	just what i needed !!
NEG 	Ordered this ring for my soon to be husband! It's heavy and (to me) worth the price!
NEG 	These were a good bargain for the size and quantity I needed.
NEG 	It's sticky on the lips....i have to keep applying...... But forthe most part love the flavor
NEG 	Very pretty. Runs a little big but still pretty
NEG 	Nice set of tools for metal earth models. It would be better if the square bender had an open end.
NEG 	Fits on smaller desk
NEG 	This is a beautiful mirror! It brightens up my blue wall 🙂
NEG 	Not like the shavers for generations... this one cannot get a 5 star. Blades have less of what gives a good shave on women's legs, but it's better than using a disposable razor.
NEG 	Nothing the first 2 days, but trapped 3 on the third day. I would suggest tethering the traps to a structure or stake if you intend to use these outdoors as I believe a rather large critter (raccoon?) may have carried away one of the traps on a paw. Peanut butter seems to be a favorite.
NEG 	Seller easy to work with
NEG 	works well with my reels.
NEG 	Bought these to use in place of the cloth sack used for a Coffee Sock cold brew kit, since we moved into a house on septic to avoid grounds in the drain. These are good, though they are smaller than I expected. I thought I could overfill them slightly for a 64oz container of cold brew, but it didn’t quite work so now I just use two per brew. They are a little tedious to twist and tie tightly, but overall they work well.
NEG 	They are air mattresses so they are not the most comfortable thing to sleep on, even when not fully inflated. However we needed to be able to sleep a couple extra people on the camper floor and they worked great for that purpose.
NEG 	Purchased this kit for a classroom setting and I feel as though I have a good introduction for Grade 8 students. Update: I went to Haiti where this product was sent and the exercise books that came with the package were missing. That is unfortunate.
NEG 	It's nice- looks a tad cheap but it's nice for a navy ornament
NEG 	Not quite what I expected. In the front there are 12 blank monthly pages back to back, then around 150 daily pages at the back. There are stickers you use to make tabs for each month but they are difficult to align and fold. I would have to continuously hunt through all those back pages, flipping back and forth to figure out my appointments for the week and they would be nowhere near the monthly calendar pages. There aren't even enough daily pages to get through half the year. The pages are thick as described and the cover seems to be good quality, overall it's decent for the price. I'll probably just give it to my son to journal in.
NEG 	Very high-quality sox, but not designed for running/anti-sweat/breathing. I don't regret buying them for situations where I need a thicker sock; however, I was looking for more of a sport sock that is thin and breaths well. Overall a good quality product for anyone seeking a thicker sport sock.
NEG 	My dog is watching her figure. She likes these and I am hoping it will keep her happy along with not adding the pounds on.
NEG 	I like how grippy it is. Does add some bulk.
NEG 	It is alright, not special
NEG 	Does what I need it to do Only wish it charged while in the pouch.
NEG 	I bought these almost two years ago and out them away until i was ready for the holidays. I just found them this year...lol Very heavy construction. I bought two and installed the one. XMAS lights and a vacuum cleaner are no problem for this durable unit. But when I went to install the other one in the garage I realized there was no screw (you can take off the cover of the existing two outlets, and plug this one in, and then a screw holds it fast. So I'll need to find a long screw somewhere that fit it correctly.
NEG 	I have a bakers cyst it helps me get my steps in,and it's comfortable.
NEG 	Fit my door well and the display makes my hats easy to grab
NEG 	Liked the way it looked with the dress
NEG 	Purchased this product on a whim while trying to find a new skincare line. I was plesantly surprised at how soft it has made my skin feel, how light it goes on when applied, and the light scent as well. Not overpowering just the right amount. I only wish the company made a face cream with SPF in it.
NEG 	Good quality no question about it! Although they’re not clean at all!! Planning to return them because of it.
NEG 	matte lipsticks in a lot of shades, very easy to apply and stay on a long time even after kissing and drinking
NEG 	Beautiful! Very delicate. Hope it lasts.
NEG 	Good price and seems durable.
NEG 	Nice flip flops, tighter fitting. If you have wide feet go up a size, they were a just fit for me at size 10, I have a very normal/average foot.
NEG 	I needed something not to protect the floor, but to keep wooden bar stools from making a horrible screeching noise every time they are pulled out or scooted. These fit well (I measured per the chart in the pictures), and stay put. They work well in completely silencing the horrible noise the stools used to make. Because they are truly like knitted socks, they will not break or crack like so many people complained about the plastic ones, but I'm not sure how long they'll last before they wear through. For now, I'm happy with them.
NEG 	Really great information. About fish and other fishing related topics.
NEG 	I’ve been using this product for over a month. It smells wonderful and hydrates my damaged hair, but running my fingers through my hair leaves a tacky, greasy residue on my fingers.
NEG 	Fabric is really good. Nice fit. Bottom strings are too long though
NEG 	Bought these to keep in the camper for camping trips. We set them out in the sun during the day and hang them in the trees around the campsite at dusk. We love these lights for the sake of ambiance but they do not produce a whole lot of light. To anyone thinking of buying these for "glamping", I highly recommend these.
NEG 	I will start by saying that this waist trainer will definitely have your waist snatched! I put it on and I was surprised by how itty bitty my waist was. I ordered it because the image looked like it was a little bit longer in the torso than the one that I currently use, bit it looks about the same. I will definitely be using it for my next size down.
NEG 	the frontal sheds alot but the hair was good
NEG 	This lube is amazing, a little bit goes a long way and the texture and consistency is amazing. It dries a little too fast, but most lubes are like that. The smell is a little funky, kinda smells like a mix of plasitc and strawberries. But overall i would recommend, and i will buy again.
NEG 	I own 3 of these in different colors. Good binder, suits the needs for my Star Wars Destiny cards as good as the other X brand but much better price. Thicker band is nice, and just like the other brand, I can fit comfortably 2 cards each slot, front and back. They slide around slightly, but not enough for it to be an issue or even fall out of their pockets.They will also fit sleeved cards as well, will be tight and possibly stretch the pocket if you try and double them up sleeved though.
NEG 	Good quality for the price.
NEG 	Had an atomic clock for over 10 years, then it stopped working. I like that it has indoor and outdoor temps which are pretty accurate. But was very disappointed that I cannot see the date or day of the week ever from about 2-3 feet away. I did not have that issue with my previous one. I considered returning it, but decided to get a calendar and hang it below the clock so I could see day/date. I also like the moon phases .i took off one star because of the day/date issue. And it’s not the size - it’s that they are very faint.
NEG 	Great ideas. I made several projects from the book and even used the generic knot section to create my own design.
NEG 	I like that it's a 2TB but it's not compatible with my ps3
NEG 	Not messy. Feels nice. Dries quick. No sticky feeling. Ordered to replace a product they no longer make.
NEG 	I really like the Natural Chocolate flavor, I use it more than any other flavor or brand. It doesn't mix as well as some of the others, but the ingredients are better than others I have used and the taste is pretty good. Natural French Vanilla is a little too strong for my liking on the flavor, was hoping for a more subtle vanilla flavor. I have been mixing in a small amount into iced coffee to act as a french vanilla creamer, also add a little to various things. I cannot have this as standalone, just too strong.
NEG 	good quality, fits perfectly. if it only had the pen holder in the right place. it would have been perfect
NEG 	It was sturdy and did the job. It heated up fairly fast and wa easy to hang. Great for a quick outdoor shower.
NEG 	I love the feel of the case, although it is not real leather, it has a nice feel to it, feels and looks like a quality product. The only thing I do not like is that the buttons on the side of the phone are somewhat recessed now, not as easy to access as I would like. The fit is fantastic, and not too bulky for my purse.
NEG 	good colors but kind of doesnt balance so good
NEG 	Although I prefer padded envelopes, these are very tough containers.
NEG 	Great beginner carving set. I come from a long line of wood workers and wanted to try my hand at it. I ordered this set and was surprised by the quality of the blade and handle. The blade wasn’t completely smooth when I bought it but after a few passes on a wet stone and the included strop, it was in good shape. Nice set!
NEG 	My son picked this backpack out. We just received it in the mail & it’s green instead of blue. He is a little disappointed, but opted to keep it anyway. Other than that , it seems to be a well made bag.
NEG 	works great no lifting anymore
NEG 	I like the way it looks and it's very functional. However the directions for installing it were terrible. If your not savy with tools and hanging things on walls I wouldn't recommend it, or hire someone to do it for you. The directions were vague at best and left too much room for error when glass is involved.
NEG 	Decent quality and not too pricey
NEG 	This book was a Godsend. Where I use to spend countless hours doing documentation, it’s now a breeze. Would benefit from including other aspects of psychological needs but you can find nearly every diagnosis with skills to teach and work with clients on.
NEG 	First I want to point out that the one I received has a scratch down the middle. Not to happy about that because I spent 10 bucks and some odd change on it. However, with that being said, it isn't that noticeable and I highly doubt my 7 year old will care. That is the only negative I have about this binder. Everything else looks good, and I am excited for him to open it on Christmas.
NEG 	fun game for everyone
NEG 	I got this after having to replace 2 different 2DS XLs with broken screens. (Let's face it, they are pretty fragile.) As mentioned in other reviews, the cloth provided to wipe down the screen is pitiful. You'll need something else. The stickers for pulling off dust can be a little tacky, but I solved that problem by sticking it to my countertop first to take a little of the "bite" out of it. Worked great for removing little flecks of dust. Screens went on mostly bubble-free after that, I was able to use the bubble card to push out all but a couple of small ones. Usually those are caused by improper cleaning before you put on the screen protector, as was likely the case for me. Overall, the protectors fit well and there are no issues with glare/unresponsiveness. Even my 6-year-old was happy to have a little something extra to protect his new (and hopefully last) 2DS XL. I'm not sure about the protection it will provide long-term, but spending an extra $8 or so to hopefully save $150 is a worthy investment.
NEG 	First purchased the size 3T for my 3 yr old, but they were already a bit too small, so returned for the next size up. Just received them and am happy to see that they look quite balanced in their over all roominess! The cotton feels pretty soft and my FAVORITE thing so far is that they DON'T stink like harsh, toxic, factory chemicals!!! ***I recently ordered several different sets of pj's and was VERY disappointed to be so overwhelmed by such toxicity in the air!!! Esp. two different sets of Gerber brand pj's!!! -I was shocked how strong smelling they were! Of course, they are a mainstream brand and I'm sure they produce most (if not all) of their baby/children's goods over seas! :-( Ugh!
NEG 	Beautiful pillow cover. Vibrant colors. Excellent price. Extremely slow shipping from China. Took 3 months to arrive.
NEG 	I love the keyboard because it actually works and I use it day to day. The only complaint I have is not being able to put it into a case when I'm done. I use the box it came with instead but it looks tacky. I haven't had an issue with the keyboard other wise.
NEG 	Surprisingly well made, and designed. It is a bit hard to turn when you have a load on it, but that can be fixed by strapping two of the wheels so that only one on each side is in contact with the rolling surface. I cut a wood block to fit between the uprights and the upper wheels then strapped the wheels up against the wood. It works perfectly now as a two wheeler.
NEG 	I like the Honey Nut Cheerios especially since I am Gluten Free.
NEG 	These slippers are very comfortable, but I found them to have a somewhat large fit. The stitching around the top of the slipper is also a little irregular, but they are very warm and soft.
NEG 	Great fit, and for the price... cannot be beat.
NEG 	Bag is durable and well padded. It's also big enough for most of my hardware. Some hardware may be too big for the bag without completely disassembling it. It can also get difficult to carry if there's too much in it, or if the sizes of the contents allow the bag to bend. If I upgrade, I will probably go with a longer bag/case with at least one hard side and with wheels.
NEG 	I have keratosis pilaris and also other tiny zits all over my body and it seemed to help with this. Not completely eliminating them but it helped. It's kind of an odd soap though because it is like a tarry substance that has to be cut up or smeared onto the shower rag. It didn't cause me any allergic reaction though which is very good. Overall I am satisfied with it and would recommend it to others.
NEG 	I use it in my bedroom so I can get my footing get in & out of bed (I'm handicap)probably get another one in the summer
NEG 	Feel very pleased thanks you guys are awesome 👍🏼
NEG 	Easy to use Difficult to tell if one side differs from the other
NEG 	Good product for the price. It’s meant for hair that’s on the fine and dry side not for hair that needs a stronger moisturizing to it.
NEG 	I loved the slimness of the design, doesnt take up much room on the counter and the different settings for soap dispense works great. Had an issue with the first one, contacted customer service and they sent me a replacement.
NEG 	This razor does it's job. It's not as powerful as I'd hoped but it does what it's supposed to do.
NEG 	Nail quality glitter.... the foam beads will bleed as shown in the pictures the vendor shows... fimo slices are slightly lower quality than i am used to but still very good quality
NEG 	Perfect for small projects.
NEG 	These socks provide great compression. They do the job and my feet/legs feel great after the end of a 12hr shift. They are thick near the foot which provides great cushion. I have 2 complaints. 1) the foot/toe part of the socks are very wide. Which can make it difficult to fit into well-fitting tennis shoes. 2) The band are the top can be very tight. I end up having to roll it down by the ned of the day. Overall, great compression. Wide toes. Thick sock with cushion
NEG 	I bought two of this item for our office desk. They look and work great. Assembly was a little bit of a chore, but if I would have had a bench vice it would have been a breeze. The one thing that disappointed me was that The one package was missing 4 of the 3/4 inch elbow fittings. I ended up having to run to the local hardware store to get what I needed. If it wouldn’t be for the missing parts, this would have been an easy 5 stars.
NEG 	Some meat items leave residue in pan and doesn't clean up as easy as described
NEG 	Glue rolls on pretty good, cardstock holds together once you press it down. Refills are easily installed.
NEG 	They’re definitely NOT Non-stick. Even with Pam the pancake batter stuck.
NEG 	They look nice , and are an inexpensive soultion they are plastic. I wish that would have been listed in the description.
NEG 	very interesting - another good read can't wait for more books by this author
NEG 	I delayed before writing a review, because it was quite comfortable when I first tried out the set...and it still is! I use it in my truck as I drive alot. I was skeptical about how long it would last, and it's still like new. Has helped my lower back pain greatly. The gel seat cushion gets very stiff in cold weather; needs to be kept inside on cold nights. And seat strap on back support has held up nicely, although it could be a little longer.
NEG 	Easy to use and install. Happy there is no annoying sound announcing a call has been received.
NEG 	I'm a prepper. Not used these really but tested 2-3 cycles and appear good to go. Price is right, quality acceptable. If they don't puke, I'd buy more. Battery quality is really my only concern- to be seen.I consider these emergency backup equipment. Or for camping. I leave these on a window sill to charge.
NEG 	So far so good. Looks really cool. Slick design. Love bitcoin! Flat and thin
NEG 	This case is good to show off! But it doesn’t work protect your phone but it looks fancy with this case cover! If you want your phone too look good then buy this, if you want to protect your phone then I won’t recommend this case! It’s gonna break ur phone and it’s heavy!
NEG 	Very understandable and useful. I'd like more sample Tests in order to practice acquired knowledge.
NEG 	1st bottle functioned great, but stopped spraying after about 6 weeks, with only minimal use (less than once a week). We didn't drop it or use inappropriate liquids or any of that. We didn't have trouble with mold yet, or it getting dry (altho we live in the desert). Contacted the seller abt the broken mist sprayer, and they very quickly sent a working replacement. We don't know how long the replacement will work, but the customer service is outstanding and we appreciate their responsiveness. Excellent!
NEG 	It is a beautiful bamboo crafted cutting board. Large spacious compare to any of my other board. Being this big I expected to be heavier. There should be rubber pieces on four corners on both sides so it doesn't slide on my tile counter.
NEG 	At the beginning I was skeptical with the reviews of this eye cream but decided to give it a try and is worth it. This is a gentle eye cream that really helps with the puffiness this was my main concern in obtaining this eye cream and loved the dispenser that it's very convenient.
NEG 	OK, in my opinion It's not the most beautiful style or shape as some of the other diffusers I've seen on the market ..I think this one looks a little like one of the lights on top of our local bridge. But that's just me - you might like it, or see it as looking more like a cylinder candle. To me it really does look like a bridge light. Good points - It's easy to use, it works just fine, it shuts off by itself based on a few different times you can set it for, and if you are into colored lights, there is a variety of them you can choose (or rotate) to suit your mood. It does the job.
NEG 	Used in our truck for long trips. Very comfy.
NEG 	Oh yes! Lorenzo - such a hot and intriguing character. Is he a bad guy? Is he a good guy? I’m going with he’s good at being bad ;) The chemistry between him and Catalina was off the charts! Great story line. Loved this family dynamic. I can’t wait for some of the others to get a book!
NEG 	Great product, but do NOT believe the coverage estimate. Add at least another 50% if you want the job done right. Aside from that if you do your prep work, (and a lot of it!) you will have an amazing floor!
NEG 	These are a good size and shape to give a visual of the web on the map with mini figures. The webs sit loose in the base, which I wasn't expecting. The web sits on a slight angle, which I think was on purpose; however, that wasn't clear to me before purchasing them.
NEG 	This very helpful information about disease healing. The book contains many proofs and a good explanation. This book is very detailed and well explained.
NEG 	You get what you pay for. That's such a common saying and it's true for this product as well. Pros... it is inexpensive, fits the phone very well(even with the curved edges of the screen, the side buttons on the phone work perfect with he case on, the belt holster seems to be very secure and easy to attach and remove phone from. Cons... the kickstand broke and fell apart on the first use, there are a number of defects (dips, bumps, and frayed bits) on the rubberized part of the case. The cons really should only concern very pick and detail oriented consumers. Over all I like the case especially for the price. The kick stand is still usable, it just lays back a little further than it's supposed to. You can tell the design is wonderful so, in my opinion, all the flaws are production related.
NEG 	Removed laser sight because glass was cracked when it arrived. Very accurate without laser sight! Great product for the cost! Keeping rodents out of attic!
NEG 	Bought if to take photos and vedio is to my son, works good, just be careful when you take off you phones, that might bite you finger.
NEG 	The glass screen was a bit loose, but other than that the tester works great
NEG 	This pack is great, only problem is the clips that hold the breakaway base aren’t super strong so most of the time when you try to grab the bag it doesn’t unvelcro, the whole thing comes off. Not a big deal since I’m an emergency the point is to get the pack n take it to where u need it and this will do that, just that afterwards you have to reattach the Velcro vase. Overall great!
NEG 	These are great stories with witty dialog from amazing characters. However, I would rates these as moderate plus for profanity and sexual content.
NEG 	Works better then the other brand
NEG 	I like that this case is sturdy, although i’ve Just had it for two days, I hope it’s durable.
NEG 	This bag is a little bit big for a lunch bag, but I like it because I pack breakfast and lunch, plus a big water bottle. So if you want an extra large lunch bag, this is great.
NEG 	This was a gift nD I don't know much about it other than the recipient was pleased with it. It was a bit smaller than I thought though.
NEG 	The gummy has a good flavor. A little different consistency than regular vitafusion prenatal gummies.
NEG 	Works as advertised. Figured out how the charger worked.
NEG 	NICE HAIR FEELS SOFT. IT DOES SHED A LITTLE AND SINKS BUT SMELL WILL GO AWAY AFTER 3 WASH. IT IS NOT AND NEVER TRUE TO LENGTH.
NEG 	Great for our pup who played in her water cup.
NEG 	I got this book by accident, and since the blurbs suggested. it was not the sort of thing I usually like, I was quite surprised how much I enjoyed it. The pace was rapid despite a range of crimes and possibilities. The characters, even incidental ones, were interesting. I did feel the build-up to the conclusion/final crime was both too obvious and too drawn out, but of course the ending was entirely satisfactory. More books by this author will definitely be on my list.
NEG 	Seems like it's working, but whew! Tastes horrible in your mouth!
NEG 	Cool looking figure! Only issue is the head doesn't want to come off most of the time.
NEG 	I’ve usually been against flat cord designs but these seem to work great. I’ve had them for a little over a month now and I use them every day. The bass is pretty good as well but I’ve had better.
NEG 	Sturdy and comfortable. Just make sure you get the right size.
NEG 	Nice shirt. I originally ordered a medium but it was too small. Large is great, so I’d be a bit generous on choosing the size.
NEG 	it felt very stiff, which i didn’t like. and the seeming on the edges looked very cheap.
NEG 	I wish the ball was bigger but, it's a good tight ball. Just what I was after.
NEG 	Smaller scoop that what I thought it would be.
NEG 	I gave it 4 stars because I felt the beginning chapter was a bit uneven, but as I got into the story, it gripped me. The characters, location, and the twists kept me reading well into the night. After posting this review, I'm going back to purchase the next book in the series.
NEG 	helped reduce the obnoxious brightness of a clock in my bedroom - just wish there were more bigger sheets
NEG 	The best stainless steel cleaner and polish. Oil based but doesn’t leave an oily film.
NEG 	It is what I expected
NEG 	Wish the enter key was in another spot but other than that love it
NEG 	Love this massager. It's bigger than my last one but it is pretty powerful! .... As people say, you can use it for many different reasons but mainly, it is powerful enough to vibrate your whole body! I like to use it on the back of my neck, as I have daily tightness there and stress buildup. It definitely relaxes you. The reason though that I give it a 4 is because (as others have mentioned) the buttons cannot be easily located (especially at night or if you close the lights) ... You have to fumble around and try to figure it out, otherwise, you can see the ridges of the 3 buttons, when you turn on the lights. Charging is easy enough, as it comes with a wire and you just plug it in for a few hours and it's ready to go again! I only use it for a few minutes at a time, to loosen muscles so I haven't calculated how long it lasts altogether but I have owned it for weeks now and only charged it 2 times so far, so I can clearly say, it's goes a long way and still keeps the strength. The downfall, is that when it dies, it literally just stops working and doesn't slow down first so you know to charge it soon... One second it's working and the next, it stops suddenly! That might be bad for someone who wants a heads up! There's a read light that comes on, once you have turned on the main button and they stay lit, for as long as you have the massager on. It's true that the red light is NOT aligned properly with the buttons and it looks pretty sloppy that way but it's just a small little issue and doesn't really bother me. Not sure why people would want to travel with this, it's pretty big and does indefinitely look like a sexual pleasurable toy so I wouldn't want to be caught at an airport security, having to open my bags up and pulling this out of my suitcase ... I would DIE! I usually travel with a carry-on or handbag and they always inspect those, upon your security check. Wouldn't be convenient to travel, unless you a) don't care about getting caught with it b)you have checked-in luggage and won't get caught .... or for those who don't travel, and don't care either way! lol...Overall, I would say for anything under $40 bucks, this seems legit and worth the money to invest in. It has a sturdy and solid build and the head does not rotate (just vibrates) so I think it will last a very long time. I'm also happy with the overall velvety smooth finish, it glides on my skin and feels very comfortable and soft! Great buy!!
NEG 	It’s a very approachable study guide and does a good job of summarizing. Sometimes it seems to jump around a bit but overall does a great job of encapsulating an enormous amount of information. Some images or color would have made it better.
NEG 	It is a somewhat entertaining read. I hope the Dan Coast series continues. The location is better in the Keys.
NEG 	This pillow was honestly amazing for helping me (wife) get comfortable when sleeping at nights. It was a bit firm at first, so needing to be broken in for sure. But it helped so that I could sleep all night long finally! One thing I wish was different, the cover it came with was so hard to get on the pillow!
NEG 	Love that the timer helps me to save water set it and if I forget I don’t have to worry about over watering
NEG 	I ordered the grey... and I’m pretty sure I was delivered white because the picture looks nothing like the color I got.. but it’s still cute!
NEG 	A bit big..tends to fall off. Metal is nice and inscriptions are lovely.
NEG 	great price. perfect as favor
NEG 	Works well, kinda gives the tingles in your fingers. This isnt their fault but the peach mango flavor isnt great in my opinion. Its just a little too sweet and when mixed with water doesnt taste awesome. Totally could mix with juice and be good though.
NEG 	So installation is simple enough, a few youtube videos and the right tools and it's pretty easy. I did the replacement myself. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is that resolution is a bit limited compare to the original screen, max for this screen is 1366 X 768 so if your eyes are used to something higher it will feel weird, it's functional nonetheless and it just takes time to get used to it.
NEG 	nice bags, but it is ironic, and counterproductive, that they were packaged in a plastic bag.
NEG 	Perfect for yogurt and granola A little small for cereal
NEG 	These are somewhat large but the size range 0-6 months is a huge range.
NEG 	Bought this for a long car trip, the idea is awesome, but the square design does not conform to the body well so it made it a little awkward when it was in their lap. Not too mention the flap as well, just seems like there would be a better solution there. The kids didn’t use them as much as we would have hoped, so not sure if that had anything to do with it or not.
NEG 	Length and size perfect. Material a little thin but hangs very well...definitely buying more for spring here in Kansas!
NEG 	good case. Would like to see a soft case with the same functionality.
NEG 	Great value for a refurbished smart phone. No scratches and functions as new.
NEG 	Shipping made many small pieces but great taste
NEG 	I finally found an eyeliner that goes smooth and stays on the waterline! I have been looking a long time! Very nice, easy to use. The only problem, and it's not small, is that this product does not last long. What you see is what you get. Once the tip you see is down 2/3 of the way, it is unusable and you have to order another- and throw out the plastic (I am trying to decrease plastic waste so that's not good). I have had kohl pencils I bought in Istanbul that lasted for years. This is the same quality. I just wish there was more of it in the pencil.
NEG 	Love the dress it's beautiful. Got lots of compliments. Putting it on though was tricky because the zipper couldn't zip up until I zipped it up with just my waist to chest then my arms in. Thus how I got the zipper to close all the way.
NEG 	I like the deep flavor, but it is high in salt, PLUS A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY! Use sparsely!
NEG 	So nice I can extend the life of my Bose Quiet Comfort 2 headphones with these cushions.
NEG 	Actually only 1.5 liter max capacity, which is misleading. Sometimes it's hard to open the lid. Other than that, it does look good and boils quickly and I like that you can set the temp and also decide whether you have the keep warm function or not
NEG 	Shoes are flexible and comfortable
NEG 	Super cute mug just a little small tho! Great for milk and cookies 😊
NEG 	This movie was funny however some parts didnt play well
NEG 	I have not used the well advertised eraser sponges. I need these for my tiled kitchen wall behind my stove, sink, work area. They really worked well and made the job so much easier. I also used them on my white stove and they did fairly well. I am impressed they didn't fall apart at all.
NEG 	Easy to hang. Nice size. Not the prettiest shelf but serves the purpose.
NEG 	such a great book for my kids. really like telling them every night about this
NEG 	Overall I am very pleased with these curtains. The only reason I'm giving them a 4 instead of a 5 is that when light shines through the curtains, it makes the white of the curtains look beige and less bright than appears in the online picture. I was hoping to have the contrast of the stark white against my walls, but when the sun is out the white is more beige and faded.
NEG 	My truck would not start without plugging in the heater the original OEM is very small compared to the White Rodgers went out this morning at 26 degrees and truck fired right up, no more plugging in. Also, mine arrived with no new nuts or lock washers larger posts nuts are different than OEM had to go to the box store and find some that fit. Other than that my problem is fixed cranks right up.
NEG 	This is a truly inspiring Wicca Herbal Magic book. is a very helpful look at the Ultimate Encyclopedia on Wiccan Herbal . This book is recommended for highly effective! it was evidenced in the results I experienced.
NEG 	These muffin molds are okay really flimsy if your trying to fill with anything i suggest putting a backing sheet underneath. If not for sure everything will spill other than that there good.
NEG 	I have used Quicken for many years and it is extremely useful to download and track expenses, create reports, import data into Turbo Tax and much more. That said, it was very disappointing when Quicken now basically forces you to buy a new version every single year by way of subscription if you want to keep downloading information from banks, mutual funds, etc. Before you could keep that feature and just buy a new version every 2 to 3 years.
NEG 	Very nice set! The color is vivid on our wine glasses. Comes right off with water.
NEG 	This little light is pretty impressive! I was a bit hesitant on purchasing this light, but for the price, figured I could just return it if it didn’t work as advertised. 1: The install was so simple that it took me a few minutes to figure out. I assumed it was a lot harder than what it was and kept overthinking the install. 2: My eyes! This light is BRIGHT! To me, this light is perfect for your low light/no light scenarios. It’s bright, but not too bright. 3: Beam Me Up! The green laser on this light is pretty awesome, says my cat. I love the fact that I can have both the light and laser on at the same time. With minor adjustments with the provided tool, your laser and light will be as accurate as your shot. The reason for my 4 stars: The light and laser button are slightly difficult to differentiate/operate while holding your firearm with a proper grip. Maybe this is something that you just have to practice with and it becomes muscle memory. Another thing, if this is going on a firearm that you plan to carry, good luck finding a holster. You’ll have to use a universal nylon holster of some sort or have a custom holster made. If you’re using this for training or don’t require a nice IWB/OWB holster, you won’t face this issue. In summary, this light does what it’s designed to do, and it does it well. For the price, you can’t beat it! My own issues are with the buttons and the trouble finding a holster.
NEG 	Everything about this light shows good design. The diameter of the light is less than some other lights I've tried which is good. The on/off switch are fool proof to keep you from mistakenly changing the lights brightness.
NEG 	Nice set up for the cost
NEG 	works for me as a pick up. I only use 1/2 a tab and that is enough
NEG 	Product does exactly what it says. I would have hoped for something a little bit more stronger but they do what is advertised and I am satisfied
NEG 	The shoes fit as expected. Very well put together and looks real nice with jeans and casual slacks, like dockers etc. I will be coming back for different colors. Charles
NEG 	This is much bigger than I had anticipated. Exactly what I hoped for. It's a tad heavy but the weight is nothing to shout about. The only issue that I have with this, is that it did NOT come with the alen wrench that is necessary to adjust the mounts. Really a big bummer.
NEG 	It's ok for the price , I use it everyday and support heavy loads .
NEG 	I could not imagine having the life Tabitha had to go through and yet overcoming and going on to live a life dependent on the Lord. Well done, but hard to read her low points In life.
NEG 	Good simple, book on practical aspects of home wiring to the code. Recommended. This book has been revised practically since electricity was invented.
NEG 	They did the trick! I was very happy with my daughters. Wish the straps on mine were a little looser. Cheap material but perfect for a couple hours to do a photoshoot
NEG 	I am a big fan of this style cord with a flexible fabric/metal cover. They are much more durable than typical plastic cords
NEG 	Looks great but they shift out of place when door is opened.
NEG 	Works good but tube doesn't go very far. Ok for the price. A larger jug would be better and transfer to a small soap pump dispencer.
NEG 	Well written but I’m lost when she makes numerous references to astrology! She does make me think I should have a reading done, though! Looking forward to discussing at book group tonight 🙃
NEG 	Speaker produced good sound above 70% volume. But was mediocre below that. Bass wasn’t there. But a decent speaker for the value.
NEG 	Received the product damaged. One of the solders were broken so only 2 of the 4 led strips would light up. Messaged the seller and they mail a new one the next day. Happy with the product but more so with the seller.
NEG 	Very very nice, fits well, kind of hard to wear at first, but you just need to adjust the attachments properly and has a good battery life.
NEG 	Not what I expected but are peak proof and customer service is excellent!!!
NEG 	My girlfriend seems to love this stuff. I tried it and it just smelled and looked like runny orange juice.
NEG 	It fit as expected. It just seemed like it was cheaply made. I will definitely use if but it's not my favorite cover up.
NEG 	First off, yes, this fits a 2018 Colorado ZR2. On the Fab Four website it says it won't fit the ZR2 package but it did. Although, it needed some custom work done to the spare tire lowering port for the plastic to fit. This bumper is really heavy duty and I know my back end is much more protected now. Plus it has the added steps as the stock ZR2 bumper doesn't have any because they would get sheared off when rock crawling but these are thick solid steel. Besides the extra work for the spare tire port the only other nitpick is the fact that it bulges out on the sides and it is flat which is a bad thing as far as aerodynamics are concerned. Although it is probably negligible it would have been nice to have had it angled even a little to improve air flow. Besides those two small complaints I like the bumper and I would recommend it if you want a good looking, protective, and functional bumper. Also, if you're wondering why this ZR2 is so clean it is because it just got a complimentary car wash, it is usually covered in mud.
NEG 	They were nearly too small for my daughter who wears a size 7 shoe. I recommend buying one size up.
NEG 	These are kinda hard to get on tbh.. I am an intelligent, well-educated adult but sometimes these make me feel like a four-year-old when I have to put these on and can’t seem to figure out which direction it’s supposed to go. But once they’re on they work well! I’ve bought 2 other products just like this and this product has been my favorite by far. It helps to keep my AirPods in my tiny ears, whereas without this product the AirPods fall out constantly. They’re also super comfy because it’s silicone-type material which makes it very flexible and comfortable.
NEG 	They’re super cute. The oval hoops uhh metal thing or whatever it’s called where you hang it from is off center so that will be weird to hang but whatEver
NEG 	Bought this for my daughter. I love everything about it except the strong odor it has. It had to be washed before I could give it to her.
NEG 	I love the functionality of the product, however, it feels as though there's just a piece of cardboard in there. Something a little more rigid would have given the product a longer life span
NEG 	I’m giving this product four stars because it does not taste bad at all. But I cannot agree with the claim that there are no residual burping. It tastes like a light oil going down and the pineapple flavor is very light.
NEG 	Not high end equipment but works well for my intended use.
NEG 	My granddaughter likes it. I only wish it used smaller yarn because the size yarn that really works the best and makes the nicest items is not easy to find in all stores and the selections are few.
NEG 	It is just right for my intended use. The only improvement would be a pouring lip.
NEG 	Decent hat but size is not accurate.
NEG 	Very pretty colors and patterns. It's a little snug near the shoulder blades/upper back area
NEG 	this is a good product and works as advertised.
NEG 	they were lighter fabric then I expected but they will serve the purpose for Halloween
NEG 	It took a while to get these but worth it. Have made lots of jewelry with these.
NEG 	Loved this installment of the Brie series. Sir and Brie's baby is born. I love how she uses things that she's learned through her training to get thorough childbirth. Too bad that their joy was short lived as Brie's woes follow her. Can Sir make it right?
NEG 	Very good product for the money!
NEG 	It's 1.5 inches thick with my phone inside, because it's a wallet plus a removable magnetic cell phone case, it's a bit heavy BUT it's well constructed overall. My only concern is that the wrist strap eyelet will tear over time. The magnetic connection of the phone compartment escaped my attention when I selected the case but it works quite well. I'm pleased.
NEG 	I purchased this board because the one I had was shaky. This is definitely a more stable ironing board and for that I would give it a 5 star but the material and padding on the top are very thin. It would be nice if it had a thicker padding. All in all I would buy it again but i would spend a little more on a thicker pad that doesn't move around.
NEG 	A great shoe not uncomfortable. I wore the at a conference.
NEG 	This washer works great. but it's small. We are two people, we cook everday from scratch. so you still have wash big pots{they take to much room). You can't jam pack washer, so it's takes some practice to maxium amount of dishes done. It does work great
NEG 	It’s truly beat as a great 2nd bag to take for “just in case” you overload on shopping, but not good for the extended trip...the bag is sturdy, but not the easiest to manage when you’re trying to travel quickly between trains or in/out of a car.
NEG 	So good for hanging tools on. Clip could be slightly tighter to prevent it lifting up when removing tools.
NEG 	Strong magnet! I use this to hang a rubber apron up to dry and the magnet has not slipped or moved from the cabinet at all. I just wish the carabiner was one size bigger. Works great! Someone did steal mine from work but I found it and had to use a hammer to get it off the surface it was on! I’m looking for the strongest magnetic hold possible so it cannot be stolen from me again!
NEG 	One of the funniest books I’ve ever read. I laughed at loud and that so rarely happens. The writing is very clever and witty. In the beginning I thought I’d be giving this 5 stars but then... it’s a long read. Especially when the overall conflict could have been resolved sooner had the characters simply talked to each other, which is mildly frustrating.
NEG 	I've still not made the minimum so I just go on and on and on I loved the book but not this process.
NEG 	Great screen protector, other than the fact that it doesn't stick to the screen near the edge. It does its job and protects the screen, but in my opinion, it doesn't look nice.
NEG 	Upon reciving it the strap look immediately broke. I just wore it strapless. Its absolutely fabulous! I got so many compliments
NEG 	I ordered these seeds from several vendors and Many Cats has come through! Two years ago I ordered seeds from other vendors. One never arrived, one never sprouted and the final one did not survive transplanting to a bigger pot. Those seeds came from China but Many Cats seeds have come from The Phillipines. I planted them in the large pot so no transplanting will have to be done. Just wondering why these seeds come from Asia since the historical origin is Mexico. Even more curious is why they are not grown in California. The cosmos seeds have sprouted. If they actually bloom, I will make it five stars.
NEG 	These plants are great. They came packaged well and I got one of each type, no doubles. Made me happy. Only issue is that one of them seems to be dieing. Not sure what happened but half of the plant just started to wilt. The other 3 are doing great.
NEG 	Even though I did probably everything pretty much wrong ( I ended up diluting the color too much, I probably should have gotten two bottles instead of one since I have long hair) I am still very pleased with the result. The product doesn’t smell too strong and my hair definitely no longer looks yellow. If you have hair down to your waist I recommend 2 bottles instead of one so you can have enough color to avoid patchy results like me. EDIT: So I tried the product again and modified my method. Instead of one bottle I used two bottles plus approx. 4 oz of conditioner to that to dilute (NOT 4 oz per bottle but 4 oz for the whole 2 bottle mixture). Left it on for 1 hour and I am way more please with these results than the previous ones! It’s has a *slight* purple tinge the less you dilute it but it’s not too bad if you are dyeing on an ash blonde shade (my bleached hair level, the recommended shade is a platinum bleach to get a true grey color when you dye). This time it is less patchy too. Conclusion: for waist length hair, I used 2 bottles of the color and 4-5 oz of conditioner to dilute to get my desired results on my second attempt!
NEG 	Super comfortable. The sound was good but not great.
NEG 	Perfect buy I’m not sure how you thought of this but I’m mad I didn’t think of this first lol great job
NEG 	Very nice smelling bath bomb and its very moisturizing. Great customer service too. I had a problem with my order and the company responded immediately and fixed it. The earrings are way prettier than the picture shows.
NEG 	There are many other works in this area. This is a great text but definitely not the only source I would look for in this area.
NEG 	I picked these Sensor night lights over competitive similar type lights listed on Amazon, because they offer a simple turn on and off. Other brands offered only work in completely darkened rooms. These offer 6 lights in each fixture and are plenty bright. I was so satisfied with the package of 3 units, I immediately order 6 more.
NEG 	Good quality. Number of stats in the varying sizes a Plus+!!
NEG 	I really do like these pillows. They do remind me of hotel quality pillows. I purchased other pillow cases prevent it from getting too warm through the night.
NEG 	Good product, worked well
NEG 	Great little fan and easy to upgrade a standard vent. Moves much more air than the little 4" fan. But not quite as much as the larger ones. But those require complete replacement of the vent and the roof work that goes along with it.
NEG 	Works great for light jobs. Suction is OK. Nothing to dance a jig about!
NEG 	This mouse pad came in today and i was super excited because ive been going without a mouse pad for a few weeks now. First impression is that for the price, its great quality! I love the options for colors and not needing any drivers, just plug and play. My one concern is that the lighting is not very bright. With my ceiling lights off, it looks good. But with them on, its noticeable but nothing that sticks out, per say. Either way, i love this mouse pad and for the price, its a real competitor!
NEG 	I have a Pixel 3a with a Spigen Tough Armor case, and I have to remove the case to use the clamp. It doesn't open quite wide enough to fit. Other than that, the product is fine, it is stable, the fab thingy take pics and vids like it's supposed to, the legs can grab onto poles or stand up straight. It's a good product.
NEG 	I'm disappointed in the ingredients on the actual product including slot that is omitted in the ingredient list on Amazon. I've only tried the mango this far, and while good earth claims to use no artificial flavors or sweeteners, it tastes like there's an artificial sweetener in there. Kind of powdery... I drink alot of things that contain stevia, and the sweetener in the tea doesnt taste the same. I'll probably drink just because Amazon charges shipping for returns. But I wont be re ordering. I try to stay away from ingredients such as natural flavor. The mango tea lists natural flavor 2x on the packaging. I haven't tried the others yet so I hope they're better.
NEG 	Nice substitution for the very expensive other brand doll. Bought as a Christmas gift, so haven't yet seen how it will hold up to a 4-year old's handling of hair and costumes.
NEG 	I actually liked this story quite a bit. I was worried about the tentacle stuff, but the author handled it well. I liked the pace the story develops at and the relationship between the characters. I will have to go back and read the others in the series.
NEG 	It did take a long time to receive, but I am one happy customer! The clip is sturdy and I will be hard pressed to break it. This is no cheap pot metal replacement but high quality. The screws provided didn't quite want to screw into the holes but that is okay because I had the originals. The seller was very helpful and responded quickly when contacted. Glad to have my EDC knife back in action!
NEG 	Too quiet, can barely hear it if it’s not on your ear. Otherwise very nice V Tech toy.
NEG 	Overall happy. Fits small in the top but bottoms fit as expected. I’m 125lbs, 34” chest, 26” waist, 38” hips and medium fits pretty well.
NEG 	I really wanted to find a product that whitens teeth without using the standard strips, so I was looking into charcoal powder and came across this. The color is a dark gray, and looks a little freaky at first but isn't messy like the powder plus it doesn't stain your toothbrush. The consistency is a more thin, watery feeling instead of the typical paste and foam. I feel like my teeth are fresh afterwards, but as far as the whiteness, I can't tell if I see a huge difference. They definitely look nice, and mostly white, but I wouldn't expect a dramatic difference the first few times you use it.
NEG 	Good product but quality is average
NEG 	The background isn't as muted as I would like and I wish the mic were able to position closer to my mouth to control the voice level better. Otherwise, it's a good headset. The cushions are the best part!!! My head is average size (or at least I think so) and I didn't need to extend the ear pieces at all. The materials are REALLY robust so the risk of it breaking like the one this replaced are very slim. If you want a headset to last, this is the one. The cord is very sturdy as well with attention to detail on the connections to the plugs as well as the sound control knob. I am impressed so far and I use a headset daily for work.
NEG 	Wrap is a little wider than others I've tried. Not as warm either. But this is a good product.
NEG 	Bought so i could separate my car key from everything else to avoid straining the ignition switch. Works like a charm, unfortunately I found an alternative that could be more useful to me in a smaller form factor for my keys. I do however plan on using the horseshoe bar piece from this as part of my next keyring.
NEG 	Very cute and my daughter loves it. I should have paid attention to the measurements because it was smaller then I expected. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because putting it together was a pain. It took me and my husband 4 hrs to put it together. Our wrists and hands hurt after all the screws. The price should be less for all the labor we had to do ourselves.
NEG 	I was taking these 4 in the afternoon and then for the evening and had moderate results. I've been started taking 8 together under my tongue and have noticed a much better result from this. My plan is to do a NAD infusion and alternate between an infusion and then pills. I'm doing this because I had low energy. I'm definitely not bouncing off the walls, but I do find that I have long-lasting consistent energy. My sleep is deeper my dreams lately have been very Vivid and very odd but nothing too terrifying or harmful just deeper dreams for some reason. I think what I like best is that my mood is so much better and my outlook is so much more positive. I just feel a deeper sense of happiness, wholeness and completeness. Please remember though I have had a NAD infusion so I don't know if that is enhancing the pills. Either way I've made a great choice!
NEG 	They're good. Used them for door prizes in the bags for my daughters baby shower. People loved it!
NEG 	As described. Nothing more to it. Can’t complain.
NEG 	It does not operate all the functions. I was unable to find an original, but it opens the tray, plays, rewinds and fast forward. What more should I ask? Thank you
NEG 	Only complaint is that it smells too sweet, kind of like scented markers
NEG 	I love this clock. If there's anything I don't like it's setting the darn thing. When you "fall back", you have to manually adjust the hour forward - meaning you have to crank the tiny little wheel 23 times (hours) to adjust it.
NEG 	Our pug loves these, they just don't last long once he gets them, haha. They are all cute and all the squeakers work. The hamburger will last the longest because it's rubber. They are small and he plays easily with them. Will buy again in the future because he likes them so much. Would definitely recommend for your fur baby.
NEG 	Works great..price is right
NEG 	This is a page turner. The characters are believable and the story is compelling. Unfortunately, this is another of those books that leave you hanging, which to me is a cheap plot to get you to buy the next book and the next...
NEG 	Helps you understand yourself better. It does hop around a bit which may make it difficult for some top follow.
NEG 	The product itself is great. Absolutely no complaints. However, it comes in plastic. I did not notice that in the pictures, although it is as plain as day. So disappointed.
NEG 	The fit is great...love the case
NEG 	Works just like the big name brands, with the exception of the lack of yummy flavor coating. Basic care basically works. It would be nice if the manufacturer would not use excessive packaging, which is wasteful and makes you think there is a lot more product then there actually is. You will find this packaging issue even with the big name brands. Good day.
NEG 	I purchased three of these after my initial purchase, I liked it much more than other one purchased. This one stays clamped in place, it may move down depending on where you place yours. Mine is on my dash behind my steering wheel, I just don't trust the suction ones you put on your windshield or dash. It is a little hard to bend, but after where you get it where you need it, there is no reason to move it. I like this one, which is why I purchased four, two for both my vehicles and one for my sister and another for my father. Good product.
NEG 	The kids loved these, they were a bit smaller than expected but still great 🎁
NEG 	It was a little small for my Galaxy Android because I have a protective case on my Samsung
NEG 	Very nice rash guard & good fit, I do not recommend white for children. Stains do not wash out, worn 3 times now trash
NEG 	This is my second one. It's pretty thin and doesn't last longer than a year. But for the price it's really fine. The colors are nice. It's really a cute wind sock. I'm sure I'll order again next year
NEG 	What can I say about having to give yourself injections.
NEG 	Good size and nice color
NEG 	This product was handsomely packaged with good quality tools and new screen protector. Instructions/ illustrations where not a clear as they could be. Would update the steps of removing and applying stick strips of double sided tape. Illustrating: gently pulling both right and left tape strip and what side of the new stick strips are placed down in the case and which end faces the bottom of the phone. Also include steps to remove and replace screen protector.
NEG 	I bought this because I thought it would be a great way to open up some counter space. Having our towels on the fridge is very convenient and I love that aspect of this product. The magnets are very strong, we even have some other items in the top portion and have not yet had issues. We do however find when you first fill the paper towel holder its difficult to use and awkward until the roll goes down a little bit. Not a deal-breaker by any means for us, but just something noteworthy.
NEG 	Seem of good quality not happy with the brightness. I put 6 under motorcycle and its lit up but not as bright as I would like.
NEG 	Get what you pay for nothing special.
NEG 	Much better alternative to other expensive brands.
NEG 	So far I like this item. It works with my phone which has a thicker case and seems to grip well. Although I haven’t went on a long drive yet. Con: the weight of it makes the vent rotate down that even the adjustment can’t overcome. So I put a dark screw in the vent which stops the rotation. Just put it between the vent slats. This isn’t a BMW just a Ranger so I’m not looking to impress with my engineering.
NEG 	This product is exactly what they tell you to expect. It works in a small capacity. It really won’t cool off your room but does provide some cool comfort at your desk or bedside. Because of the misting feature when the cooling is on it really increases the humidity in a room. This can be great in winter but tough on a hot humid day/night.
NEG 	Highly pigmented! I love it
NEG 	I like the water pressure and the different options. But his product seemed not well made when I took it out of the package, for the cost. But so far it has worked well.
NEG 	I am very satisfied with this item. My bottle although doesn’t have the symbol on it but that’s the least of my worries.
NEG 	One tab broke in the first week, but the plastic is so hard it is sometimes a little difficult to push the tab in without using a lot of force. They don't look terrible, and except for the broken one it seems to work as advertised. I can't turn on the gas stove without opening the knob cover. I've got a GE gas stove with 6 knobs (five burners and one for the lower oven) so that's one reason I went with this product. A lot of the others come with only 5.
NEG 	I have had it a few months now no issues. The price is right. It is better than I expected based on some reviews
NEG 	very nice and reasonably priced. good value
NEG 	Doesnt come with bolts
NEG 	This is a big set for earwax remover. I’m using it couple time. It’s good. I’m try not to use it too often. So far I like it.
NEG 	This was an excellent gift for my son's birthday!
NEG 	I have probably tried four different versions of these over the past 18 years. The flow just never appealed to my cats. This one worked! Within the day both my 18 and 16 year olds were using it. They seem to like the bubble mode more than the flower. Not five stars because the cord is pretty short and I wish there was one other flow type.
NEG 	does the job and well priced .
NEG 	Great clippers they just don’t come with the comb .
NEG 	This queen frame was really well packaged. Not a scratch on it. Paint looks nice and durable. I wish they had painted the whole thing rather than just what's visible but that's fine. Only issue was two holes were off a bit so I will have to fix that with a drill but all together good buy and very sturdy.
NEG 	I had to return this micrometer because it was broken. Other than that I would been satisfied with it.
NEG 	Rated a 4 because weapon is to loose in Holster. Screws will not tighten enough. Price is good fast service, weapon fits draw is easy but can’t tighten correctly.
NEG 	Bulky and doesn’t fit in most car cup holders because of the circumference of the middle of the thermos. Otherwise, washes easy and the black color is nice & sleek.
NEG 	it is too soon to give a accurate review
NEG 	I wasn't paying any attention about the size, but it is really small. It is a gift for my grandson's 8th grade graduation and he likes it. I may order him something else larger. He likes it.
NEG 	Arrived on time, works beautifully.
NEG 	It was hard to put down and I enjoyed the unanswered questions. The characters were real and quite likable. Good read.
NEG 	Love it. Just wish the chain was a little longer and stronger.
NEG 	I’m happy with my order quality is god strong not cheat at all the only thing I didn’t realize was it didn’t have a corks but I can go to the store to buy one or online ..
NEG 	Works great for PS4 my son 14 years loves them
NEG 	pretty dress. red color runs and fades, wash separately
NEG 	Works well for a basic cycling piece of equipment. Not too much with tension adjustment, so better for longer repetitive movement.
NEG 	Product arrived missing screws and washers that were part of kit. Customer service request went unanswered. After getting missing parts, installed part worked as designed and solved issue. I recommend purchase but ensure all parts are included before you start work.
NEG 	Drain stopper is nicely made and works nicely in a tub style shower. Creates a good seal. Easy one push to open and lets water drain. I love the idea of it catching all the hair that normally clogs my shower pipe. I feel it’s a good value as it comes with 3 drain stoppers in various colors. The reason why I rate it a 4 is because it’s not compatible with a stand up shower drain (see photo).
NEG 	It's a good product. It not what I was specting. Too small, my fault.didnt read the product specifications. I can still use them.
NEG 	This product worked so well on my ring! After the first clean it looks brand new!
NEG 	These earbuds seem to work very well so far. i needed to use the smaller inserts so that they would stay in my ears. I am hoping they last for a long time. The sound quality is good. I use them with my waterproof I pod almost daily.
NEG 	I travel and have to set up a small office for about a two week period. This stand gets my laptop screen to a good level so that I am not looking down all the time. It is compact and perfect for travel.
NEG 	Amendment *** after contacting the company, they have graciously shipped replacement parts for me! I've had this thing for a month and one of the round platforms has fallen off. Cheap fake wood material. It falls over when my KITTENS jump on it!
NEG 	Sturdy little trash can! Sad it wouldn't fit in my car door but I gave it away to a good home.
NEG 	I love this! I have one in my wallet, one on my keychain, one on my dogs collar one on my cell phone and one on my TV remote. I really wish I could get a second remote for when I go out (keys wallet, dog, phone) but after I inquired I was told it was not possible so, I take the remote with me. I lost my keys once and could not find them anywhere! They had slid way , way down deep in the crevice next to my car seat (not even visible) . I went to my car with the remote and hit the button and beep! But finding the beep required me to keep pressing and, tada I found them! Without the remote I don't think I would have! It's already paid for itself!!
NEG 	These are good quality pajama and my husband seems to be very comfortable in it. One thing to keep in mind is that these does shrink a lot after you wash. We ordered a medium for my husband and it fit him perfectly until it was washed. He still wears them, but the sleeves and pants are short. I suggest to order one size up.
NEG 	Over all I love this case so much! The silicone is soft and sturdy, it doesn’t make it much bigger than the phone already is. My main issue is the condition of the case itself. The first time I purchased this case the paint was damaged and off center. Not too noticeable but still a let down. After the case got messed up by my friend’s house rabbit I decided to buy another one. The second case arrived in perfect condition. The paint wasn’t scratched or where it wasn’t supposed to be. I was extremely content. But after trying to put it on my phone I realized it didn’t fit. I’m not sure if they sent me the normal 8 version but the camera cut out cut out my camera so I’m buying the case again and hoping and praying it works this time. Third times the charm. Besides that. I’ve received so many compliments and smiles from my phone case. I think the only reason I would recommend it to someone or buy it again in this case is because of its authenticity and originality. You can’t find this case many places.
NEG 	So good! I love it. Wish it was a better price
NEG 	good quality, hood runs small
NEG 	Item was a great purchase, our 2 week old quickly adapted to the rocker sleeper and sleeps well however one of the metallic push clips that is supposed to hold together the upper and lower was pushed deep inside the rod when we received the item. I did not want to go through the hassle of returning and receiving a replacement item so a hex nut and bolt from the Home Depot resolved this issue.
NEG 	Very complicated assembly. Good quality construction.
NEG 	Easy to swallow, smells like raspberry
NEG 	I gave it as a gift, so I can't evaluate it very well. I liked the size,
NEG 	The problem with having a keurig coffee maker is most of the time you only have one choice of coffee per box. This allows you to sample some of the more popular flavors to either fine one you like or like I do have a verity.
NEG 	This is a great binoculars. The only problem I have is that the cover for the eyepiece won’t stay. It keeps on falling off because it’s loose. They should have made it the perfect size so it will stay.
NEG 	Worked decently. I have 2 turtles the size of half dollars and it keeps water clear for them for about 3 weeks. I bought a more powerful one but should work fine for fish.
NEG 	They are a very nice shoe but I have to return them cuz they're too small
NEG 	Not as light weighted as I wanted however it's a very good and easy to easy wear
NEG 	Love the cleanser, but why would I pay $10 more than I paid just 3 months ago? And at that time the price had also risen from the last time I purchased, and the bottle size was taller BUT with a significantly smaller amount. I have been buying this for over 6 years. I actually just started looking around for something new because I refuse to pay $37 for face wash. Hello?
NEG 	Cooling, helps relieve itching, softens skin.
NEG 	Such a cute book, especially for kids almost ready to quick sucking their thumb.
NEG 	It worked pretty well. I didn't see a ton of difference at first but in combination with a tablet featuring bleach it finally got rid of most of the disgusting gunk in my toilet. It still isn't clean enough to eat out of but it's much better.
NEG 	Not sure how long these will last because our 4 year old grandson moves around in the chair but so far, so good.
NEG 	It does it job. Good Buy.
NEG 	Just a few drops and it's all good.
NEG 	This is the first non Otterbox Defender phone case I’ve used. Therefore, this review might be skewed. To get started with the phone case is much thinner than my other one. That might be good I’ll update this review after I drop the phone. The construction doesn’t feel as strong as the otterbox. The clear glass piece went on fairly well. I had to fight an air bubble for a little bit. All and all for price it seems to be alright. I don’t feel that it will hold up as long as an otter box.
NEG 	Great tumbler and straws, the kids love it. It's not 100% spill proof so use caution around toddlers but overall I like it. Helps keep smoothies and drinks cold for awhile.
NEG 	These are safe for human use.
NEG 	I bought this as a replacement to one Pampered Chef used to sell but discontinued. This is easy to fill and seems to work pretty well. It is not quite as sturdy as the PC model but I love using it. If you want something that will grind out tons of pepper I would not expect this to do that. It's great for table use but I don't think it will grind fast enough for heavy use. The salt comes out fairly heavy so check yours before salting your food!
NEG 	Such a cute little gift. My wife loved it. I thought it would be a little bigger but welcome to the internet! I think it’s a great gift for a wife, mom, friend, girlfriend, or anyone you love and want to give a little gift for no reason!
NEG 	Nice shirt, picture was a little chipped but other than that a great buy
NEG 	Took me a little while to set it up, but it works well. Requires 4 D batteries and there’s no option to plug it in, but the battery has lasted long. The projection and light stay on for about 5 seconds when you tap it and when the alarm goes off so it’s not too bright.
NEG 	The casing that protects the phone if dropped. Shipped in a timely manner and the price was great!
NEG 	The dog still hates it but it works for clipping his nails!
NEG 	I was looking for some extra utensils for the holidays. I was looking for something that if I purchased and turned out bad, at least it would get me through the holiday season. I stumbled onto this item and I kept thinking the price is too good to be a good product. In the end, I bought it saying if its not as good, at least it wasn't expensive. I was thoroughly surprised. The shine, weight, and size were comparable to the more expensive utensils I already owned. If you are looking for a product that will look nice and not cost a fortune, this is good one to put on your table. I didn't give it a 5 star yet, I want to see how they make it through the holiday season.
NEG 	We are very happy with this purchase that we just bought 2 more. One for another bathroom and one for the grandparents. We are training using a potty seat instead of a potty chair. Our toilet is chair height. So, not only do I have to pick up my child to put her on the seat but then her feet dangle. This is the perfect height so she can walk up (supervised) and her feet rest flat as she is sitting. This is also the perfect height for her to wash her hands. Note: the step stool is tall so I would always suggest toddler supervision when using (even when the toddler wants to do it herself). I extend my hand so she can use me to balance as she walks up and down since the steps are a bit steep.
NEG 	When the deer started munching on my rose bush leaves at night, we ordered this fence. We were given a date, but that order was at first delayed, then it was canceled. I waited a couple of weeks and ordered again; this time it came as promised. The picture looked as though the fence was painted, or at least a primer coat. It was not painted at all. It was cost effective and does the job of deterring the deer.
NEG 	Not sure if this is for home use or not, but it tends to be a bit weak as far as chocolate favor. I have to use more than I normally do per nug of hot chocolate.
NEG 	Sometimes it cuts the pills so harshly that it flings the half into another section of the device, that when you open the lid, empties out the backside.
NEG 	Fix heater in our RV.
NEG 	bought these for my 9 year old step son, he LOVES them
NEG 	Makes my single stack undetectable. But is hell on your hands when running tap/rack drills.
NEG 	These are so cute! My daughter loves them but the elastic is way too tight.
NEG 	These were very cute, but many were bent in the package and wouldn't lay nicely as a result.
NEG 	Works great. No problems
NEG 	Working so far no problem
NEG 	The product is great for keeping your paint protected and your car clean. After the first application, I only have to wash my car with some water (I do a full wash every couple of weeks) and it is done. However applying the product is not as easy as it sounds, you have to dry your car and then buff out as it will leave streak marks if you only do a quick dry.
NEG 	Each billionaire was matched with the perfect female. The first stories had more twists and turns. The men had great friends and the upscale bar was the center.
NEG 	It's a little smaller than I expected, but maybe I should've gotten a different shape. I love the 7/8 inch, feels like pillows under the feet.
NEG 	So it took me a bit time to get the chain onto the drive notching gear... wasn't clear at first look how it's supposed to fit and the manual isn't exactly clear on that either. No big deal. Then I noticed that there's no oil in the box... hmmm. I should've thought of ordering a quart too but couldn't Amazon or the seller just put a gentle reminder (like.. batteries not included for all kids toys - oh so no reminder necessary for man toys)? So I head to the local Lowe's and get a quart of Husqvarna bar and chain oil... why is the "Oregon oil" that Amazon bundles with the tool so expensive? Anyway... once I got everything set up off I go trim the palm trees in the hot sun. Works great or as good as I expected. I could use a bit more than the 30 deg maximum head tilt angle for navigating through all the leaves and getting a good hold - instead I had to move the ladder a few more times. Not sure how one gets 14 ft total reach.. feels a bit shorter to me. Guess if it was any longer it might be too top-heavy to use. The way it is it works fine but I was at the top step of my ladder. For trimming tree leaves and branches, this seems as good as it gets. Less than 2 hours and I was done with 3 trees, including pulling cables and cleaning up. The last time I did this with a pair of loppers I got 1 and 1/2 trees done in the same time before I was too exhausted to finish it. Taking 1 star off for getting me to go get oils after putting things together.
NEG 	Runs small. They need an xxl
NEG 	This fake camera has kept the premises safe from the 'bad hombres' coming in from the south... so satisfied it works... also have a S&W to deter anyone who does think its a good idea to cross that fence.
NEG 	I will let you know the results and see in the printer doesn't reject the computer chip
NEG 	The strainer does hold water in the sink but the basket is smaller than the one I was looking to replace.
NEG 	Purchased this for my sister who is a big aroma therapy fan. The beads are lovely and very colorful. It's definitely better worn as a necklace. If your wrist is on the smaller size you'll be stuck between twice wrapped being too big but not big enough to get the 3rd wrap around.
NEG 	The range of diagonal input on the sticks is too short. Not at all good for FPS. Other than that, I like it.
NEG 	Writes smoothly and cleanly. Does not dry up and clog between uses. I use it for drawing. I have the extra fine and just ordered the medium. It arrived with the barrel snapped in three pieces. It was shipped in a flexible bubble envelope which probably got bent during shipping. This item is not returnable, but when I contacted Amazon, I did receive a refund. So I am going to order it again and hope it arrives undamaged.
NEG 	the rings are of good quality. However, they are too big for my liking. I am using them for my tragus piercing, and I feel I should have bought a smaller size. Yes, it is hard to put the closure in place, but it's doable.
NEG 	It’s a great bag, really protects my laptop and tablet. The only thing I don’t like is that it’s a bit small and it can’t expand like most laptop bags. But very good quality.it does it’s job
NEG 	The viscosity of it is a little more fluid than i would look for in s builder gel but it works well. Very self leveling.
NEG 	I'll update after using it for the week.. It's on bed now it's soft for sure.. Update later
NEG 	great at getting you pumped up. directions said one scoop and it was more than enough
NEG 	Very nice looking! One star off because the machining was off on one screw hole so i was unable to place one of the four screws. Im hoping it will not be a problem since i poured in two bags of sand
NEG 	The watch worked well for a couple of months, but then started to lose battery life quickly. I contacted customer service and they were very efficient in resolving the issue to my satisfaction.
NEG 	The first few times I used it the milk frothed but then the third or fourth time I used it, it didn't. Then I used it again for the fifth and it did froth, so I don't know what happened. Overall pretty good product.
NEG 	Great dress for a great price! Very flattering. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the length. I’m 5’8 and the dress was a bit short for me to wear with 3 inch heels.
NEG 	it looks good but get a size up unless you like some what tight shirts.
NEG 	Very cute message for kitchen decor, I like it.
NEG 	Great gate, we have an offset wall and it formed nicely, does need to be screwed into the wall and is not pressure mounted but we love it. Has a great cat door you can also lock, or for your small dog. The only downside is our daughter could crawl through the little door for a small time.
NEG 	works well and does the job it's supposed to, feels sturdy.
NEG 	Briefly said; this is a great computer fan, but the structure is too tall for my taste. This made having one hand up on the keyboard and the other one much lower on the mouse, a very uncomfortable and weird position.
NEG 	I love these cups for my 3 year old! They are leak proof and hold a decent amount of water for when she is at preschool all day. I removed one star because the last set I had, the plastic piece that holds the spout in broke when my daughter dropped her cup. I wish it was more durable to withstand little kid wear and tear.
NEG 	Product was shipped on time. I used it for ratchet wrenches fit snug at first and loosened up a little. Only thing I'd like to see on this would be rings in the top corners so you could hand on a peg board.
NEG 	Good first book. Decent story. Somewhat obvious plot. Characters need fleshing out but think that might have been not done intentionally. Future books will/would be used to finish expanding the character. Overall I would say read the book.
NEG 	The lights came well-packaged and were easy to assemble. Everything works fine, except an on-off switch was missing from one of the lights. Still, they are a great value, and I like having the option to either plug them in or hardwire.
NEG 	Exactly what i needed
NEG 	A very nice variable temperature tea kettle. As others have noted it beeps a lot and operation is not quite intuitive, but it can be figured out. Also takes a bit longer to come up to temp (in spite of smaller capacity) than my other tea kettle. Probably best feature is the pour. Very easy to direct the flow of water over the tea leaves.
NEG 	Love the collar. Color is beautiful. It does slip and has to be adjusted but I wouldn’t consider that a no deal. True to size and sturdy buckle.
NEG 	BEWARE YOU WILL NOT GET A 12 OUNCE BOTTLE!!! First, this is a great product. I use it for my 60lb lab during thunderstorms and fireworks. She is very anxious and will sit there and shake. I give her 3 treats (which she loves) and she will stop shaking and relax. What I DON'T LIKE is that this is NOT a 12 ounce bottle. The first time I ordered I recieved a bottle that was 6.5 ounces. I reordered off my previous order and was sent a smaller bottle that is 4 ounces. Both for the price stated for 12 ounces. BEWARE THAT YOU DO NOT GET AS MUCH AS THEY ADVERTISE.
NEG 	These 10 prayers are simple, easy to remember, and powerful. When these prayers are said, prepare for what God has planned for you.
NEG 	I have not had problems so far
NEG 	Good read. Like Caleb's four friends lots of future stories there. Caleb and Kira both had a lot of things to overcome but this story answered a lot of them.
NEG 	Very comfortable for what it is. My son really doesn’t like stuff on his face but seeing he like to go under water it does just the job. Doesn’t seem to fog up like most do. Doesn’t leave huge red marks on or around the face and doesn’t fill up with water.
NEG 	1st one broke at key holder ring, so I bought another then just used the case (and new battery), was easier to swap the cases (and battery) than reprogram the alarm system to delete the old and add in this new one.
NEG 	4 Star because some coffee and tea stains just do not clean up as easy as Comet but with Corian Soft Scrub is recommended.
NEG 	Since I didn’t have a set place to put coins in my car, I bought this to help with the situation. While the quality isn’t the best, it’s affordable and serves its purpose of storing and counting coins.
NEG 	I keep buying them. Bought several already, no problems at all.
NEG 	I feel like Taking this off will scratch my new phone. Also it started changing color and looking dirty within 24 hours.
NEG 	There are advantages of slow cooking and of course recipes. The book showed how Atkins low carb diet uses a powerful life-time approach to successful weight loss. The Atkins diet has been heralded as a go-to for short-term weight loss, but our panel of experts in health and nutrition say this fad diet's effect on long-term health leaves a lot to be desired. The book has what we should know before starting this diet.
NEG 	really only bought for the code that my granddaughter wanted, doll is ugly.
NEG 	The mat is well made but our bunny doesn't leave it in original condition for very long. She tosses it all over.
NEG 	A detailed explained book about blockchain technology. So much informative book. I can serve as a great introduction and in that regard it serves its purpose I may be a good place for one to get started in understanding this technology which will soon affect our lives. The book was useful for me and I learned a lot.
NEG 	works for what it's suppose to do..lol
NEG 	My kitty has food allergies so normal kidney diet food could not be used. The powder worked to bring her values back to normal but gave her diarrhea. Evidently, she was allergic to the supplement also.
NEG 	I haven’t noticed a huge difference with these and I don’t smell the scent. But I also haven’t had any clogs so I suppose they are working. Not sure I would go out of my way to buy these again.
NEG 	Not the exact match but works OK
NEG 	It’s easy to file a claim and they guide you.
NEG 	The bowls are a great clean modern color and nice design. These bowls were purchased to go to college with my daughter. I was hoping for a little larger bowls, but for her they will be great. They do seem like they could be on the fragile side.
NEG 	I would like to thank you for a very good and prompt service with my order I'm very pleased.Thank you very much and have a bless day.
NEG 	What a different twist in this, to start with- Darcy’s relationship with Anne. Darcy just grabs your heart right away with what he is going through. Sweet story. Highly recommend it!
NEG 	We rotate both Crave flavors with three other soft, highly digestible soft foods. This keeps our cats eating, not rejecting the "same old thing". My wife has trouble pulling the foil covers off even using the handy tab.
NEG 	It is soothing and may help retard the onset of cataracts. If that could be proven I would give it ten stars.
NEG 	Came with defects took two months to get here but very soft and slow rising
NEG 	Chuck and Ivy. Chuck is a Snake shifter and bartender at the Crossroads Bar. Ivy is a Swan shifter bent on avoiding a mate. Then she stumbles into her mate. Hilarity. HEA.
NEG 	I use these mop heads two times a week for my floors and they do a decent job.
NEG 	It seems to be built well enough, but unless you have used keyboards like these, then you may have a hard time figuring how things work, Took me forever a couple of times to get the keyboard to even recognize the WASD keys. Try looking for directions online without those keys...lol Very inconvenient. There are limited instruction, nothing on how to undo or do what the keyboard was intended to do. I at the moment am using it, still uncomfortable with it, yet, I am determined to make it work for me. Good luck, hope you find it easier than I did using this thing.
NEG 	It's a old school product and it works
NEG 	Wish I could turn off red light in back and had to settings for greenlight
NEG 	I enjoy word games. This one not only makes you think about where The word is but what a word could be with the titles.
NEG 	They're good glasses it does the job the only issue that I had is that it has a blue glare on the lenses other than that they're good.
NEG 	Very comfortable leggings
NEG 	Use on my Maine Coon cat. It definitely gets the mats out and deshed the undercoat. Takes a little bit to get the hang of using it. Shorter strokes works better.
NEG 	At my advancing age I found the print a little small. Not a problem, so I would have to give it a thumb's up.
NEG 	What a deal. Love these tires! Smooth ride. Great deal. We'll see how long they last, but so far so good!
NEG 	The product does its job, it's a 30lb solid bar of steel. Simple as that. However if you want your product to arrive clean and undamaged, don't take your chances.
NEG 	Seemed to work for me. I noticed an increase in alertness.
NEG 	My granddaughter loved it
NEG 	This is a nice product ans simple to use, but the opening is small so it is difficult for my cat to drink from this bowl. The opening in not deep enough.
NEG 	The product was to replace a previous unit I had and it worked just as well as the previous one. Only beef I had was the shipping was managed by Landmark Global and the delivery person just left the package outside the side door of my home - not even within the screen door of that entry, but outside on the driveway itself - very disappointed and disconcerting.
NEG 	This product arrived within the timeframe specified. The packaging was excellent. The only reason I gave 4 stars was one of the rollers plastic holder was broken. The brokenness is not enough to return the entire item because it functions well. I might have to super-glue it in place. Overall, an excellent exercise piece of equipment. I'm enjoying my routine.
NEG 	Great book. Couldn't put it down. Love to see the SS perspective of this character. True to historical Times and places
NEG 	Great book for Facebook marketing. Tips and tricks for new apps and features are what I really like from this book, also it explains everything very well.
NEG 	I like this product because it is very solid and sturdy tripod to hold heavier cameras.
NEG 	bryson is still one of the easiest reads around for those of us who are accustomed to someone who feels aggravated from time to time and wants to vent. i don't think this quite measures up to some of his earlier works when he was younger. travel takes a lot out of you. and, like all of his books, it seems like he takes in a lot of detail in the first half of the trip but sort of rushes thru the second half.
NEG 	Fit great! I Love them! They broke :( The buckle broke within minutes of trying them on. I still love them though. A minor fix with some pliers and they were back in action!
NEG 	CupShe has and will remain at the top of my list for best quality at an affordable price for swim suits. I needed last minute options for my trip to Hawaii and ended up picking up this set for one of my picks. I wanted to pack light so being that this was reversible, it covered my needs. Love the design on both sides too!
NEG 	The pillow case is great other than the black print is not crisp and clean. It has a little blur. My son absolutely love it though!
NEG 	Nice kit. It does the job.
NEG 	pricing could be lower
NEG 	Very nice sound, material and ukulele decorativo details. Only the tuner didn’t work but everything else is very good.
NEG 	Works for sure but smaller than expected. Not enough glue to use all the supplies.
NEG 	Fun and useful tool for the family. I like this brand better because it writes with less pressure needed to produce a line.
NEG 	I enjoyed it, and there were moments when the tension was a little unbelievable because two grown adults could not be that oblivious. It was, however, a good romance, enjoyable and I read it all the way through.
NEG 	A little bit bigger than we thought but it works very well.
NEG 	My husband loves the shirts I like them because they do not shrink after washing hold it shape also thanks
NEG 	havent used one of these since the Gary Fong Days. This item is just like it and performs as expected. I really like the straps to hold flashes in place. Provides a great diffused light.
NEG 	Positive: Good value for the price, fits easily with a case installed Negative: As another reviewer noted, there is more space than needed at the top after the glass is installed so scrolling isn't as smooth as desired. Also fingerprint smudges cling to this more than the bare screen.
NEG 	Good gameplay. Progression system needs major work. Very frustrating to earn in game credits to buy loot crates and either get stuff you don’t want it get duplicates. They will make it better in the next few months, if for no other reason than Disney’s insistence.
NEG 	It works great, after 1 moth still works really well with the original battery charge :- O
NEG 	The spray is not as strong as I needed it to be but it works well on other things.
NEG 	The products are good. Unfortunatly the white one is slightly stained. Pink stain maybe from the contact with the pink bracelet.
NEG 	Was a little leery about buying online but very nice shirt, soft and fits well. My one down side is there is a little shrinkage after washing so if you like loose buy up a size.
NEG 	I really liked this vest for my dog! It fits well, light weight and breathable. I got a medium size and it was a little tight but it fit well. I would recommend that if you purchase, go 1 size bigger.
NEG 	I ordered 2 of these and although the packaging looked the same, the clips were definitely not. One package had thin, flimsy clips when compared to the other pack. They both seem to be holding the pegs well, but I'm curious to see how the clips hold up in relation to each other over time.
NEG 	I really loved the case too bad it did not fit my phone! Great customer service
NEG 	So far these are pretty good. The sound quality isnt bad at all. They are pretty light which is good for working out in
NEG 	All components were immediately lost, broken or inserted into a pet. But that's not the toy maker's fault, we knew that would happen and we gave it to him anyway (not the pet). The thing worked when we opened the box. All the parts were there and it functioned as described. Some of them float when inexplicably placed in the toilet. Kid enjoyed taking it apart and putting it together. The little impact driver was a nice touch and continues to be enjoyed by everyone but the pets.
NEG 	I never know what size to order in leggings on amazon. I ordered a different pair in an XL that were super small, so I ordered these in the same size just to be safe. They’re cut very big! The print is very cute tho, and they’re comfortable!
NEG 	Was purchased for gift
NEG 	Fits as described, lightweight and comfortable, like the removable liner and that it is a full liner rather than just the center. Used it for several rides in variety of temps and has been comfortable for all. Little warm on hot days if not moving, but vents work well.
NEG 	Bought this to replace another one I had with more of a gooseneck spout, which turned out to be very breakable. Love the shape of this one, it looks nice on our condiment tray and is easy to control volume when pouring. Working well so far. We use it to hold canola oil for general purpose cooking and small pours into a skillet, dressing shaker or measuring spoon (as opposed to the whole jug of oil). My only complaint is that it's hard to prevent drips down the side, and fear of breaking it, but overall it's been a good purchase thus far!
NEG 	They look great. The reason for just 4 stars is I haven't tried them out yet, as they are hooked up to hose bibs, but it's winter here, so I have to wait until spring to give them a go. I'll probably order another couple this spring if all goes well.
NEG 	Great replacement, but was looking for a hose that could be attached to existing hose to extend reach. Have been unable to locate a product that allows this.
NEG 	Love this banner set. Only complaint was that you have to string everything together yourself, and the holes to put the string through were not fully punched through, so that caused a lot of bending in the letters. Still held up for the time needed.
NEG 	The bags were great except for a major paint flaw/paint cracking on the inner right bag. Bags showed up preassembled as advertised. The lock are sturdy and the keys work on both locks. The paint was good for the price. It had some depth to it and with a little wish and some care it will shine like factory hopefully. The bags are comparable to OEM. I will post an update after a few road trips.
NEG 	It seem like useless, I used it to find my iPad camera it doesn’t work. I’m not sure if I used it in correct way.
NEG 	The Carhartt brand makes good heavy duty products. The cotton is thick and high quality. Runs a little bit large in size. Shrinks a little in the dryer.
NEG 	I bought this a little under a year ago, and now the grinding part is stuck. Which honestly, is a great life span for a grinder. The paint just started to wear off, too. It worked really well, was pretty standard to clean, but if you actively use it, be prepared to purchase a new one in 10 months.
NEG 	Great only problem is the white gets dirty and it shows real quick I recommend getting a different color
NEG 	Sturdy for my 2 year old. No tipping so far. Most reviews said it was unsturdy and unsafe, but we haven’t experienced this. My daughter loves it. I would give it 5 stars if it would fold up for easier storage, but I liked the price of this one over the other brands that do fold up.
NEG 	It is moisturizing, but i think it's a bit pricey compared to andalou which is another brand i use.
NEG 	Very cute and the material is soft. It's short, though, so if you have a longer baby, size up. My nephew is 4 months old and only weighs 10 lbs. I don't know how long he is, but he's on the smaller side, and he'll probably only be able to wear this for a couple of weeks.
NEG 	Beautiful color but fits a little snug for size. And material is a matte finished Chiffon not much give.
NEG 	Unit works great! Unit is a bit too hard to close for proper seal(lid takes more pressure than is comfortable for older folks with arthritis).
NEG 	First off, if you were looking for a true ukulele, these aren't the droids you' re looking for. I bought these as holiday presents for my nephews, and they're going to work just fine. The nephews are almost 4 so I don't want to give them anything I didn't expect would get abused on a daily basis and probably used as weapons in some epic fantasy battle. These are fun, neat little toys that will do the job of sparking that musical interest while keeping my pockets safe until they lose interest. They will produce a sound if you tighten the strings, and I actually spent about 10 minutes this morning tuning them for the kiddos and they sound decent for a children's toy. The only issue I have thus far, is that while tuning the little suckers the plastic bridge on one pulled up a bit out of its place.
NEG 	I just audited 1,100 dice for packing into a board game production. The dice are small, but that is what I needed. The rolls seemed random and the shape, corners, and size were consistent. About 10 die were melted blobs, and about 90 had minor defects in paint, smears or not fully painted. A quick touch with fine sharpie pen took care of any paint lacking. Not worth time to fix smears. So, say about 50 out of 1,100 were not acceptable form production standards, but at this price a 5% reject is not unexpected and is an acceptable number. At the price it costs about 14 cents for rejects. I suggest adding 10% buffer to your order quantity requirements and you will be fine. Not worth shipping costs and wait time to try to cut it too close.
NEG 	I liked the high end luxury feel of these rackets. I regularly play badminton and have found that many of the rackets are not that strong. But these rackets feel like good quality made with graphite and durable. However bag does not really fit many things other than rackets. A bigger bag could have been better. Overall I like these rackets.
NEG 	The manufacturer of this product would do well by the vendors & ultimately the consumer by tightening up the quality control. I have read other reviews about the crooked nose pieces. Was true of my pair. My husband was able to manipulate it and make it satisfactory to wear comfortably. Otherwise it would sit on your face cockeyed. Not a cute look for Santa or a comfortable one. Very cute glasses, though.
NEG 	haven't seen but two locations of ground disturbance in two months. Pretty darn good!
NEG 	Nice quality and though it's too small for me to wear, I'll find a use for it. The advertisement did state they ran small, so it was a risk I took.
NEG 	They work pretty good on small hail dents
NEG 	Had a issue setting up the remote connection on my pc. Contacted through facebook and got it resolved in a matter of minutes.
NEG 	Kept me warm. No major issues. Fit pretty well. I would recommend to anyone looking for cold and wind protection without spending a ton of money.
NEG 	I absolutely love this app! It looks great visually, so it's great on the eyes 😝 At the moment I just wished there was a bigger selection for unlimited 😩
NEG 	Light and smooth. Not greasy. Expensive!
NEG 	Takes some getting use too but works as described
NEG 	Compact and included light was unexpected. Happy with purchase.
NEG 	It's what the product advertised.
NEG 	Came in a very nice box, looked great, very strong magnet, however started to come apart after 6 months. Thought it would at least last a couple of years.
NEG 	I was a little disappointed that it was smaller than I expected but the price was right for what I needed - an engraved dog tag. And it came in a reasonable time, so I'm happy with the purchase.
NEG 	Very nice, just need to show which side to place it.
NEG 	Cute bag, fits all my make up, although I don't have much at the moment (concealer, 4 or 5 lip products, mascara, a mirror, and a brush for my foundation). Bag is smaller than I thought; it's already pretty full. I might have to get another once I get a few more items.
NEG 	Have not used it yet.
NEG 	Cute! My students love them.
NEG 	This works great for photographing the custom tumblers I sell. I only wish the backdrops had magnets to stay in place. There is a notch in the plastic, but it doesn't always hold. I use this product almost daily
NEG 	I haven't had a chance to use it yet. But the remote frequency seems to be common because it fires off every once in a while. There is no way to turn off the remote receiver at the winch.
NEG 	The product is nice but the labels are terrible. I was able to create my own labels so that’s why I’m not giving it 5 stars.
NEG 	Great movie and acting. Well done to the end.
NEG 	arrived on time product as described
NEG 	The are as pictured. I haven’t run them for more than 4 hours, so can’t say how long they last.
NEG 	The stuhrling watch is very classy for the everyday life but not to showy
NEG 	Good game it is very addicting. I cant go further than level 20. I also wish there was a way to see your past levels and maybe play them again. Maybe with another update you will add more levels I'll kelp the app on my device and wait for more levels.
NEG 	Good unit, but is clearly labeled, "Made in China". I chose this one because the description included made in the USA.
NEG 	Stiff but decent quality
NEG 	Need for for replacement and the price was right.
NEG 	I like that it’s not bright white. The color is more of a beige which works better with the colors in my house. The logo is slightly off to the side and not centered but it’s not super noticeable. This does not have a lip around the butter so the lid can slide around and get a bit messy. It does fit two sticks of butter or the wider kerrygold size butter. The handle makes it easy to lift the lid, and the dish is fairly thick porcelain. This should hold up quite well.
NEG 	This is a very good backpack... the only reason why i knocked down a star is because it was a little smaller than what i read and hoped for. size goes well with females and kids.
NEG 	I think I would have just liked more to the story, it ended too soon... but I’m so happy this became a tv series and it’s becoming one of my favorite stories ever told.
NEG 	This is a beautiful bag! I only took a star off because of the way it arrived, It wasn’t even in a box! Amazon packed it in a plastic bag! It got squished. Other than that, the bag is flawless. It’s heavy, but that’s usually how Frye bags are, not an issue for me. I ordered the ice color and it is stunning. This bag will last a lifetime and always be in style. Absolutely recommend. I’ve been eyeing this bag forever and the price was finally right for me.
NEG 	It does not fit perfectly
NEG 	So far so good but it is difficult to change the time
NEG 	Works well for voice and text GPS is not as accurate as a normal phone when view on the app.
NEG 	Use at the water park and shipping was fast.
NEG 	Very pretty cover with slight sparkles. Works as advertised. I have had other ayotu covers and they have creative designs. I bought this one after my last ayotu cover was chewed by my dog! Great product.
NEG 	these are great adapters,i'm glad and happy with the purchase
NEG 	Works great. I stuck camera on top of fridge to watch my pup in his crate while I am gone.
NEG 	This book, "The Complete CBD Oil For Pain Relief: A Step-by-Step Beginners Guide to CBD Oil For Natural and Effective Pain Relief Without Medications, offers you the ultimate guide to how much CBD oil you need to take base on your body ..
NEG 	Good quality but not for male dogs due to rear strap. Straps that go around rear legs will be much better.
NEG 	These slippers are adorable but the ear fell off within 48 hours. Amazon was quick to issue a refund though, and gave me no problems :)
NEG 	It’s a very nice table. I’m disappointed that it arrived with a damaged box and a dent/scrape on the top of the table. Worst is that there’s no one to actually talk to. But otherwise it’s a really good looking table!
NEG 	I like the way it sets and reclines it is a little easy to tilt forward when closing the recliner.
NEG 	This was super easy to install and to get lined up. Even if you did it wrong and had to lift it, it's still possible to get just right. The 4 stars is due to the color. Working in a graphics shop, we never guarantee perfect color match. That does apply here, it was a minute step darker (I mean very minute, most wouldn't notice). Other than that, flawless.
NEG 	unit is working very good
NEG 	These paint pens tend to bleed when using them on wood. The color spreads where you may not want it.
NEG 	I loved how my son looked in his outfit except for the hat seemed to over lap a little bit
NEG 	Strong power and cuts easily. 4 stars because the spool broke in half after about 5 uses.
NEG 	I really like this series and I'm looking forward to the next book, however I had a hard time getting into this one. I normally get more and more hooked with each book I read in a series and this one just didn't do that to me. There were some really great scenes that made me happy but I feel like there was not much character or relationship development and most of the book was just Ariel pondering to herself over things to the point I unfortunately found myself more annoyed with her then liking her. That being said I would still definitely recommend this series and I'll be looking forward to the next book and hoping Ariel and her coven grow closer and stronger together!
NEG 	It’s very pretty. I love it so much!
NEG 	Vary nice fit . With deep wells to hold snow or water
NEG 	As in, you cant even hope to pull them apart by hand. But I used mine as a door latch for a sliding barn door and they great. Snap tight shut and takes but a small tug to slide the door open.
NEG 	Really cute design, easy to use, stretchy, and fits the baby's forehead well.
NEG 	Great desk light, NICE AND BRIGHT AND GREAT ADJUSTMENTS, but mount CLAMP could open further and the flex neck is a little short for my desk use. I bought a couple of the the floor model in the past and loved them. Out of stock when I tried to order more. Trond makes goo stuff. this one is not their best.
NEG 	A lot of compliments
NEG 	One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel yet, although no one screenplay can ever do his books justice.
NEG 	Since we don't have a dedicated mud room, our garage is where we store our non-dress shoes that include hiking, biking, running shoes. We had a limited amount of space (about 20 inches) to have a rack so vertical upright is the only way we could make it work. Pros: Great compact rack, easy to assemble, spins easily to get access to shoes, adjustable distance between each tier (great because my husband has size 12 feet, and mine are women's 5) Cons: the paint/coating on the pieces chips/flakes easily, NOT aesthetically pleasing to look at soles of shoes. Overall, we love the rack - it has greatly helped bring sanity & organization to our garage. Shoes are no longer lying all over the garage floor so we can now find them quickly and easily.
NEG 	This books consisted of a novella and a short story. The novella, as a stand alone, earns 5 stars in my opinion. I was not as interested in the short story; therefore, I gave the book as a whole only 4 stars. I will definitely look into more stories from Tessa Dare.
NEG 	These products have so far kept out mice. My only complaint is that they do not come in any other colors.
NEG 	Love it! I didn't realize how tall this thing is. It's perfect for my workspace - doesn't table up any table space and is easy to manuever.
NEG 	I bought these for my husband for work so that he can be handsfree in the car. They work great and have good sound quality on both ends.
NEG 	Nice...hope it withstands 14 hours of travel
NEG 	4 stars because it’s a little bit loose around the pelvic era but other than that it’s a great pick and can be work alone or as an under garment.
NEG 	This stuff is a life saver after a long day of nursing! The only thing that’s really not ok about this product is that it smells like a meth person’s BO
NEG 	This bottle is quite large and very well constructed. My only negative is that it doesn’t seem to hold temperature very well.
NEG 	This camera works really well! It mounts nicely to my monitor and comes with a built in mic that works well enough for computer voice commands. The image quality that comes though isn't the greatest but, it's good enough for skype phone calls.
NEG 	It is true to size & nicer than expected. I will wear it for casual but can work well for dressing up.
NEG 	Everyone of them worked. The tags are definitely hard to find on the card but nearly all are on the center.
NEG 	This fit very well in our bathroom cupboard in our RV.
NEG 	Slightly too wide, but able to wear comfortably. love the colors. Wish I could afford to buy a couple of other patterns I like!!!
NEG 	Brackets are heavy duty and perfect for my project. As represented by the seller. Very pleased.
NEG 	I received the stand in good shape but missing 2 of the leg protectors. Can company send them to me?
NEG 	good case for the price came on time and works great
NEG 	A perfect item I ever bought. Totally satisfied. Excellent little product. looks new though this set has been with me for a month now. high quality I have yet to use it but it looks very well made. I absolutely love this product
NEG 	Ample space for appointment details.
NEG 	Is a cute towel and the kids love them. I personally don't like the texture but I don't use it lol.
NEG 	Perfect size for my son to watch his DVD's. Works Good so far. Very Pleased
NEG 	So far, so good. I just assembled them into the frames. Let’s see how long they last.
NEG 	nice size, firm good buy
NEG 	I’m a licensed cosmetologist, I ordered this wax pot for my salon and love it. It heats up very fast, although the lid does not stay on the best, if you keep it in one spot I definitely recommend.
NEG 	I like the compact size and it seems to be true to 400 lumens (was just a bright, if not slightly brighter as a 300 lumen light I had). Also like the fact that it fits rather tightly on a picatinny rail. note it may scratch your polymer pistol's picatinny rail as it is tight. but I prefer tight over loose, so it's OK. it's awesome on a rifle. I gave 4 stars only because I haven't tested it's endurance yet on a gun.
NEG 	These cords are great, but they don't fit into my phone as tightly as other cords do. But they charge my phone super fast and transfers data quick to. They are really sturdy and look really good as they are braided. Much better than the in box cord and totally worth getting for the price. Super long to!
NEG 	It was as described,perhaps a little higher than expected.
NEG 	just wish it came with a few more plastic stakes....otherwise it would get a perfect 5 star review
NEG 	I bought it for my wife. Very nice and easy to hold. It arrived with additional gift, seems like Iphone holder but it was broken.
NEG 	I am using this climbing stick for a Golden Pothos. It has only been a few days but the roots have already started to attach. I am using a rubber band for the moment to keep the plant in firm contact with the pole. The roots have started to attach but it is too soon to expect them to support the plant on their own. This is a very effective way to add some vertical support for your pothos. I do not like my pothos to spill down to the floor. To me, it looks better when the plant is climbing vertically. This pole will make it easy to do that without having to nail a trellis to your living room wall! All you need do is insert the metal supports down into the soil and it is strong enough to hold itself up. That said, because the steel supports will need to dig deep into the soil, you need a deep plant pot. Do not attempt to use this on a shallow plant pot. Use a tall, deep pot that holds a large amount of soil in order to hold the metal supports firmly. Use common sense. Moisten the material but do not keep it soggy. You will need some way to hold your pothos to the pole until the roots can firmly attach themselves. Zip ties are too hard, in my opinion. They can damage the plant. I use rubber bands. The rubber will eventually deteriorate and break off. You can also use cotton threads, which will eventually rot away. Rubber bands are the easiest. My pole was slightly bent when it arrived. I do not know if it came out of the factory that way or from the shipping. It's not a big deal because the pothos will eventually cover the pole. The product came in a plastic package. The sharp ends of the metal supports were wrapped in cardboard. Please, be careful when handling the metal supports. The two metal rods do not look sharp but they can easily do damage to your eyes. You do not want to fall on your potted plant because the metal supports are sharp on both ends. Be careful with your pets. Do not stab yourself with the metal supports. I would have preferred thick plastic supports to thin metal rods for better safety. This product is excellent, but beware the two metal support rods. It would have easily gotten a five star rating if the rods had been made of plastic or some type of material that cannot poke you or your animals. I highly recommend this product. It is one of the best products of its kind on Amazon.
NEG 	Very good little RF modules. They are easy to use and work just as expected. However, two of the transmitters did not work, so I could only use four sets instead of all six.
NEG 	pretty cool, holds up well to weather. legs do not move so you know
NEG 	I used this the same day I received it. Ran it non stop for about two hours with no problems. I didn't have to change the belt (80 grit). When I do have to replace the belt, it is easy as pie. Just move a lever, move old belt, replace new one, move the lever back to the original position. There is also a tracking screw should you need to align the belt. I like the fact that it can be used inverted and attached to work bench. Clamps were include. Also included was a dust bin. However, i did have to empty the dust bin quite often. However, they do give you the option (and the adaptors) to hook it up to a shop vac. So far so good.
NEG 	It would be nice if Stanley would make a smaller set, and a larger set. Instead they try to meet many needs which adds to price. I use the small punches (along with a set of roll punches) for simple gunsmithing. I don't need punches to disassemble cars.
NEG 	This bottle brush is good to clean bottles. Has a nice spin to it. Unfortunately when I received it, I had the idea that it would look exactly like the picture. The nipple brush looks fine, but the silicone brush... it doesn't look exactly like the picture and by that I mean that from the picture it would look like the silicone strands are long and full, but the one I received, it's silicone strands are shorter than the picture but I mean it's still full all around and does its purpose. So other than that, it still a very decent bottle brush. A lot better than the bristle ones. The brushes dry up easy and not hard to use at all.
NEG 	Most of the games in this book I do not understand but boy do I love playing Trucks! I wasn’t really sure what I thought about trucks as a subject matter before but now I am pretty on board. I wouldn’t go as far to say I am now a truck enthusiast but I do now look at trucks in my everyday life through a new lens — one that appreciates trucks more. I would not recommend playing Trucks (and other games) at the workplace! I was let go because I kept playing Trucks. Though I'm not too worried about making rent this month because I’ve saved up quite a bit of cash this winter and I recently sold my set of banana slicers which brought in a chunk of change. But if you want to help, I am still selling a few other items which you can check out on my Etsy page (mostly wicker items). I did try to use the pages of the book to press and preserve some small leaves, clover petals, local dirt samples, etc but the book does not weigh enough to do the job well. Though, because this isn’t the book’s primary function I’ve only deducted one star from my review.
NEG 	A little too orchestral for my taste but overall an excellent album.
NEG 	This was a Christmas gift for my brother. He loves it and uses it almost everyday. To be honest he doesn't even use it when he cooks. He turns the timer on randomly during the day because it's the bat signal. Great to give as a fun gift if the person you're getting it for likes Batman or buy it for yourself. My only complaint is that the light could be a bit brighter.
NEG 	So if you wanna lock in moisture or freak out your ))SO(( than it'll do the job. I'm not sure if I have a small med or large face as there are no measurements but I'd say I am an oval face that's a tad over my BMI and it pulls a bit on my ears but it's not that uncomfortable so worth the few $$ for a hydrated face
NEG 	They actually make a difference and they feel good too!
NEG 	I like that it tells you verbally that is turned off or on
NEG 	Solid case. Can't get the stand to kick out and case is difficult to use volume and power buttons.
NEG 	Fits a size 2 petite very well. Nice color combo and soft, warm and well made.
NEG 	I already have them hanging in the yard. They didn't even have a full charge and were on last night. Not sure if its bright enough yet or not, as not a full charge. But they're pretty either way.
NEG 	Fair deal on backup phone batteries
NEG 	You know, I've used Pilot's G2 pens for work for about 6 months. Their black, blue, red and pink pens are beautiful to write with. I like using the ones that are not as common as the blue and red so I can distinguish between my writing and others. However, my last purchase I decided to go with the orange in hopes that they would be as vivid and bright as the pink pens but to my surprise they lack saturation. They are a very light orange that is sometimes difficult to read; depending on the light of course. 5 stars is adequate but the orange color threw me off.
NEG 	Definitely cheap feeling, but it was inexpensive, so I can't complain too much.
NEG 	I really enjoyed reading this box set. The characters and storylines where well planned. Each story kept you guessing till the end, just like a real mystery should. What I did not expect and to my delight found was that the main characters each grew and evolved into rounded individuals, a difficult feat to accomplish in shorter stories. Really worth a read if you love mystery with a paranormal twist.
NEG 	Very handy, not in close quarters though. A good time saver!
NEG 	I really like this notebook but I have noticed lately that highly rated products get immediate price increases. This will keep me from buying more. I was going to buy 10 but now I will buy another brand.
NEG 	Resourceful + clever space-saving product. Just what I needed to help manage my hanging clothes while steaming + extra storage space. TY
NEG 	It distorts every other radio station while plugged in. Otherwise it works as described. Update. Customer service is pretty awesome. After 3 star review I was contacted with a recommendation for support and the option of replacement or refund. I just haven't had time.
NEG 	very good. but some Blue jay still can get it.
NEG 	I really like the holster, giving it as a secret Santa! So I’m kind of upset I didn’t receive the bullet bottle opener with it :(
NEG 	This product came folded because of delivery.
NEG 	I contacted seller who refunded my money. Then I reordered and it came with two as shown in the photos. Very responsive customer service.
NEG 	I love raw Brazil nuts. Hands down these are the best I’ve ever purchased. They are fresh and with excellent taste. All Brazil nuts i have ever purchased always have a small percentage that have a bad taste, but these are extremely low. I rarely encounter a bad nut. Thank you for providing such a high quality product!
NEG 	The product is heavy enough to hold a blue yeti. It arrived missing a part, but when I told the sellers they immediately offered assistance. Overall works great for my set-up.
NEG 	This is a short read, and in case you're occupied with investigating what reflection brings to the table you, this is a decent place to begin. The creator gives a speedy establishing in the history and the many advantages, and rapidly proceeds onward to the different sorts of contemplation hone. There are many tips gave on the best way to give yourself a decent possibility of accomplishment in building a durable and advantageous propensity. It's entirely fundamental data, yet that is the plan.
NEG 	for price, not bad.... flimsy but for $20 it’s good
NEG 	Fast and accurate. Works great on bread, meat, and candy making. Great little tool for the price.
NEG 	Love the convenience of these wash towelettes. We use them after riding razors thru mud and dust. Will leave the skin feeling tight and dry if you do not wash with water after using them.
NEG 	I think it should have the Bluetooth selfie button included
NEG 	love the look. the fabric is a bit too flimsy but will look great over my swim suit
NEG 	To protect my hair and face while sleeping
NEG 	This certainly is a great idea, but the hose was too narrow to allow the large globs of lint balls that it was getting a hold of. It was also too flimsy. I took the advice of a few others and taped a wire coat hanger to it so I could guide it better.
NEG 	was what was ordered
NEG 	Enjoying the series. Hope there is more to come.
NEG 	Read reviews that said they ran small, ordered a size up. They in fact run a smidge large.
NEG 	Bought this for my mom she loves it. I got her the blue one hoping she had fun with it.
NEG 	This was a very cute kit. I’m a beginner and I found it relatively easy to use. That said, however, the diagram on the white background floral design was printed very thick and wide and didn’t fully disappear after so I had to go back and widen a few of my stitches. I did really love the colors and the way the threads were sorted and color coded.
NEG 	However, it does require you make some leaps in belief to follow it and calling it a horror movie is a bit of a stretch. If there’s a message in this one it’s don’t underestimate what Anna is capable of doing and how controlling she can be while camouflaging it with a little sexuality. It’s a real stretch to follow the plot-line to the point where you’re convinced that what she’s doing is the only way to achieve her goal but the ending summed it up nicely and made it the best movie of the night over three other choices.
NEG 	This dress is very comfortable. It does seem to run large. I am big busted so I got an extra large after reading other reviews. I feel I could have got a large and the rest of the dress would have fit better. It seemed very loose everywhere. Being that it was bigger than needed it did kinda look like a maternity dress. All that said, it's super comfortable and that's what I was looking for. Something I could throw on and run to the grocery store or dinner if you want to dress it up with some heels and jewelry. I like the material, it breaths.
NEG 	Does the job for cheap. You get what you pay for. The pattern doesn’t imprint in on clothes (which is great). It’s nearly impossible to find a square piece so you end up really pounding each piece together. It’s hidden in my closet so it does its job.
NEG 	I would give it a five but mine came and the top to the bottom container was split across the top.
NEG 	Fits great, looks amazing, but there was a fishy odor when I opened it. I had to wash them and air them out.
NEG 	I gave 3-4 of these to the fellows in my life. They seem to like it, as things don't spill out!
NEG 	Quality material and flattering style. I am 5'9 and 170lbs. A Large fits well and is slightly loose like the picture shows.
NEG 	quick delivery. exactly as I ordered
NEG 	Very moisturizing, and good to give a little color to the lips.
NEG 	Very nice knife. My only issue is that for a neck knife this is quite large and heavy. Would be better with a belt clip.
NEG 	Good product, but no HDMI though
NEG 	Colors are great, but the fit is small.
NEG 	A nice quality of stickers, but buyer should be aware that 50 out of the 150 I bought were illicit in some way - no nudity, but women in promiscuous poses, naked but breasts and privates covered, drug and smoking references, and middle fingers. This just means that I can't hand them out at school, or put it on my laptop, but if that's what you want then these are good for you. However, a lot of them are pretty cute, like the corgi stickers and the astronaut riding the unicorn.
NEG 	It's nice however charging is slower.
NEG 	I love this product just wish I had realized that it was testers before I bought it.
NEG 	Good feeling , the quality not really good, but acceptable.
NEG 	It's a show I can wear in the water.
NEG 	Lots of great bones and skulls! However, we did find a live maggot 😬 Kids loved what they found!
NEG 	Very nice. Collapsible. Very nice design. I love the vivid colors. And there's plenty of Room for my cats and kittens inside.
NEG 	Wanted to buy one of the new fancy dish drainers. As if it would make washing dishes more fun! None of them fit in one side of my divided sink. Funny, but I had never thought of my sink as small. Gave up my dream of fun dishwashing and bought this drainer of old reliable design. It fits and works perfectly. Some times tried and true things are best. Only thing I would change is having glass holders incorporated into sides to keep mugs and glasses from rolling over or taking too much space.
NEG 	Great phone and fast operating but screen protector needs to be glass not plastic
NEG 	Not quite as long as I had hoped. They do not cover my bum completely. But they are soft and easy access for nursing. I ordered a medium and they fit well. I am a 34D post part I’m.
NEG 	okay - did not need magnet
NEG 	Nice quality quilt. It's pretty and comfortable to sleep with.
NEG 	I love the flossing action and though it seemed big at first - it really was not hard to use. Easy to pack. I would have given a 5 but the small carrying case that came with it will not dit both the charger and the flosser. Either make the charger smaller - which would be my choice, or make travel case abit bigger. But as a flosser - it was great!
NEG 	I have a love and hate relationship with this bib. First off I absolutely love how soft and flexible this bib and the vibrant colors and the cute designs make it even better. I love how its not just one button that the neck can be looped through but there are 3 buttons in which I can loop it through in order to avoid my daughter from taking off the bib herself. Now on to why I was 1 star short of 5, this bib would be the perfect bib for going out because of how soft it is, it makes it very easy for me to put it away without having to fiddle for the necessary space for it to fit. However if you plan on using this bib with your highchair there may be a bit of a problem with the flexibility. In most cases for high chairs used at home there is a tray and depending on your high chair tray it may or may not blend the bib into a form where no food will be caught, which is exactly what happens to me. The bib folds inwards where the food cannot be caught and my daughter ends up having all the soup, food, crumbs, etc all over her legs. I don't need to worry about her getting cut from the bib but the softness of the bib causes problems where the bib is ultimately not catching anything that is falling. Given the material of the bib and how much I like it once I took it out of the box I had to give 4 stars. The pocketed bib is completely defeated in the case of the highchair tray but I'm sure when we are out and sitting in restaurant highchairs the bib will be differently seen. So keep in mind if you do end up getting this bib and you're planning on using this at home check you highchair tray first.
NEG 	it worked well for my chip bags
NEG 	This little swing looks exactly as it does in the photos and is very sturdy and easy to hang. For some reason my hummers have been avoiding it like the plague. I have five feeders set up around my porch. The only feeder they stay away from is the one next to this swing. I know they like swings because they use a different swing that I bought from a specialty feed store. They just seem to not like this one. I gave it a couple of months but took it down yesterday. This might just be my picky hummers. Yours might absolutely love it! :-)
NEG 	Great little MP3 my younger brother loves it!
NEG 	More pink than red.....not as dark as they look.....glows well
NEG 	Haven't used yet fishing season closed but feels and looks great
NEG 	I bought these with the intention to add to my Brain Flakes collection (because the Creative Kids Flakes were less expensive). Creative Kid Flakes were much thinner and not compatible with the Brain Flakes. I really like both products, just don't try to combine them. Creative Kid Flakes are thinner and less expensive than Brain Flakes. My students enjoy using them just as much as Brain Flakes. If you need to be budget conscious, Creative Kids Flakes are the way to go!
NEG 	This planner is beautiful on the outside. The colors are so bright and the paper feels soft smooth. I didn't give it the full five stars because the inside is quite boring to look at in comparison to the outside. Still, great quality and will order again next year or as gifts!
NEG 	I saw one of these in the local quilt shop for close to twice the price. I wanted one, but sure didn't like the "off the shelf" price at the shop. I've used this a couple time and it really makes pressing go quite a bit faster as the heat travels down from the iron and up from the wool mat. After using it a few times in pressing boarders for my quilts, I now wish I would have bought the rectangle one instead of the square, but since this will likely last forever (with proper care) I will learn to love this one.
NEG 	These are OK. Very small as other reviewers have noted. I cook for two so the small size works but it would be nice if larger was available.
NEG 	The graphics are very nice
NEG 	Material is great, nice and soft. Looks just like picture. Is a little on the large side.
NEG 	The holes for the shoes are a little small to get a pair of tennis shoes in but all in all it is a great product. It is thin so it doesn’t take up much room in the closet, it is very durable (this is used in my teen sons room)and the side pockets are great to put belts in.
NEG 	I bought two of these books by the same author as a gift for my great grandson. He loved the colorful pictures and especially the dog. His sister who just finished first grade also read them and enjoyed them too. They make great picture books with enjoyable themes.
NEG 	Simple device. Only complaints are too much grease from the manufacturer that needed to be cleaned up (and I do not know what kind of grease it is- which matters in case of reaction with the other substances you are working with). The jack is very precise with a tight machine screw thread count. This does mean it takes A LOT of turning to fully raise the jack- but the precision it offers is worth it. This is a rather small jack, so if you are running larger experiments, you might need to step up to a larger size. But for my backyard organic chemistry hobby, this works fine and I will probably pick up a couple more.
NEG 	Look great, fit great, no wind noise. Right mirror power went out after a week.
NEG 	Could use more newborn items.
NEG 	For the price this product had a variety to choose from. The ball gag was my favorite, but the nipple clamps and the handcuffs we're good to. Everything in this set is comfortable, adjustable, and very nice quality
NEG 	I stayed up late to finish THE MAN SHE MARRIED because I had to LOL! This romance turned into a deadly cat & mouse game. Harper is an independent woman making the best of what she has. She’s smart, kind and realistically cautious. I like Brad for his confidence and plan to make Harper his wife. He is so patient - he takes his time with Harper when he knows that’s what she needs. The meat of this story happens after they're married. He doesn’t tell her the ugly stuff about his past and that omission will put their lives and relationship in jeopardy. Harper questions whether she can live in his world. Brad will do anything to make her stay. Their wedding vows will be tested. Good supporting characters - family, friends & enemies. Passionate scenes and violence. Some small grammatical errors. There are a couple of instances when I was surprised Brad didn’t hurt someone who offended Harper. Perhaps this was an example of his self-control. I liked this story. It was more than I expected, engrossing from the beginning. Worth the price!
NEG 	Lasts 6 to 12 months before they start shutting down and having audio cut in and out. Probably just about as good as any $30-$50 product.
NEG 	Fit great but if your heavy above the knee then expect it not to stay straightened out. It will roll
NEG 	Looks good, haven't used yet.
NEG 	Sometimes you just want a pleasant read without having to overly think about the plot. This is well written and was a pleasant journey with the right amount of villains and dashing heroes.
NEG 	It doesn’t make bun smooth and round unless you have a lot of hair. But works as advertised!
NEG 	I have not used my bands yet bought the green and purple My first response thick heavy duty but worried, they maybe a bit long for the bars at the gym
NEG 	It works great and I bought three all had the same issue the prongs snag on my uniform and come out the or the flashlight button comes off other than that it did its job when I needed it to and that's what counts
NEG 	It is comfortable but the fabric is a lot thinner than I was expecting. The price was right for this product though considering.
NEG 	Nice watch a little beefier than what I am accustomed to, but fits/wears well. I am pretty rough on my watches and this one has held up so far. Easy to read in the dark with built in light. The analog hands can obscure the digital displays. The hands can be moved out of the way temporarily, but it is is not usually worth the trouble
NEG 	I need to get into a routine to get the most benefit from this but I can already see results. I alternate using an intense moisturizer one day and a wrinkle reducer the next.
NEG 	It took longer to get here and they are a little smaller than I thought they would be. The chairs were easy to assemble and are quite comfortable. Look good too.
NEG 	Easy to install looks nice I really like the finish
NEG 	I ordered the wrong size. I'll buy it again in the correct size.
NEG 	It's as expected. I like the secure belt clip.
NEG 	Good price for the amount you get. The only problem I have with these is The labels seem to come off too easily after you put them on. Not like my old roll which once you put it on it was ON. So be aware you will need to either place on center where it will not be pealed off or add clear tap to make sure it does not come off on you. FYI.
NEG 	Works awesome. I love this little chipper. I wish it would come with a putter grip, but not a deal breaker.
NEG 	I bought these with the glass reservoirs because my cheap bamboo ones with the metal cans rusted through and stained my deck. I didn't like that they held less fuel but they still last a good long time between each refill, though they are smaller than the bamboo style. I like the simplistic design and the glass gives it a nice regal look. The poles are hollow but mine screwed together fairly easily. The weld point between the spiral and the pole cap looked a bit weak but held when tightening. I was going to paint these a rubbed bronze but after my first lighting the black soot made me hold off until I buy some soot-free fuel. Two things I would suggest: 1) Trim the wick down just a bit so the cap seals against the glass better. I didn't and now my fuel is cloudy and yellowed from wicking moisture from the air. 2) Add an overall rain cap to further protect the finish. Because they are conical you can't bring them in and set them on a shelf. So, I use two 2-liter bottles with the tops cut off and painted which does a very good job sheltering them from the sun & rain.
NEG 	This is a lovely nightgown and the 4 stars in only due to the cotton quality. It is “good” however cold be softer it is was higher quality. The cotton is certainly sufficient just not the best quality ...and that being said I wear it regularly and am pleased overall.
NEG 	Work like they are supposed to
NEG 	The concept and design are really nice, it was smaller than I expected but it is compact and will store easily.
NEG 	4 stars because I was under the impression I was going to receive 2 of the invisible bras, but one was breast petals. This was my first time trying the bra and it held all night through dancing and sweating! I'm a full cup 42DD and it supported me well. If you want to reuse, Keep the plastic that covers the adhesive this will keep the bra sticky!
NEG 	I'm a paramedic that works in a high meth area. And I frequently have to restrain and or generally deal with meth heads being meth heads. I wanted some gloves both that would give me some protection from random meth-objects, or getting bitten, as well as being cleanable, and keeping my hands warm in the winter. For all of the above, the gloves worked really well and I was pleased with the purchase. My only complaints were there's a definite rubber/chemical smell, which wouldn't be a problem in itself, except the smell lingers on your hands. And the rubber started to crack and peel after about a month. But given the fair price, that isn't the end of the world, but I'd be happier if they lasted 2-3 months.
NEG 	Vibrant colors, says it's fade, weather, and mold/mildew resistant
NEG 	A true jigsaw puzzle, and a challenge for me and my grandson (the puzzlers in the family). It was too big, along with all the disparate pieces, to fit on our normal 4' x 2' puzzle table so we had to commandeer the kitchen table. This was inconvenient for us for the days it took to assemble the puzzle, but worth the experience and satisfaction of assembling 1,000 pieces into such a charming picture. The pieces fit fairly well together, although not as nicely as other puzzles made by different companies. Still, we'll most likely put it together again and again over the years.
NEG 	Very soft and comfortable but I ordered deep pockets because there's nothing I hate more than a bed without a sheet on it and unfortunately my husband always manages to have the sheets come off where he sleeps. This sheet doesn't fully cover my king mattress. The sheets have not come undone so far but I really wanted and expected that these sheets would fully cover each corner of the bed. Overall, I am pretty happy with this purchase
NEG 	Works good and love the color.
NEG 	Great product at good price
NEG 	I was disappointed that I cannot use this paper on dark fabric but further research revealed there really is none that I can use on dark fabric unless I want to pay $2 or so per sheet. I switched fabric to white shirt and I was amazed on how the image came out really nice on the Gildan white shirt. You do have to be aware that the rectangular shape of the paper can be seen a little bit on some of the shirts but not all. I used 400F and 3 minutes.
NEG 	Better than expected
NEG 	I am sad the bed frame was damaged but honestly amazon took care of me. The frame is super sturdy, like amazingly strong. It doesn’t squeak of wiggle at all. And I love it. Both the frame and the bed came the same time. The box was damaged from shipping I attached pictures. The bed was extremely easy to put together. And I love my new nector bed they are perfect together. Hope this helps.
NEG 	Longer lasting ; so many more prints are possible.
NEG 	They arrived packaged well. Worked perfectly for our buffet table.
NEG 	Beautiful piece, better quality and more beautiful than I expected. I like that it holds standard size candles.
NEG 	easy assembly, looks good, hopefully my kitty likes it
NEG 	The digital copy card was missing from the case, kind of upset about this. Otherwise it's just fine
NEG 	A little studio difficult to get m my head around in the brain in the beginning but be came excellant reading after that
NEG 	It was smaller than I expected but other than that it works great
NEG 	It is an excellent magnifying mirror. I've had it a few months now in my bathroom mounted to the tile, it fell once since then, I'm guessing due to the steam accumulating on the tile but overall good product. Does the job just fine. Would purchase again.
NEG 	I thought it was a mini urn to wear around the neck but its a beautifully personalized reminder of grandma.
NEG 	i actually LOVE this!! so comfy not to tight pretty flattering i would say.
NEG 	Fairly easy to use and move around. My only complaint is I wish I could order them in a larger size and I wish they made a raised boarder piece as well.
NEG 	XS was a little too small. Have XS collar and fits good so recommend going a size bigger because my puppy cannot put all his legs in this costume due to the size
NEG 	This seems like a good backpack . I will not know till I go to the gym and see how it holds up . Keep you up to date .
NEG 	Great, fun addition to the bedroom. My only concern is that once on they are difficult to stay in place and/or tighten to assist with that. So, at times, they fall off but are easy to replace.
NEG 	This is a short, fast, cute little book that was kind of like a backwards parent trap. I enjoyed it. It is a novella so it almost seems too short but It was really cute
NEG 	Could be studier but then they couldn’t get in as tight locations.
NEG 	Bought.this for my 15 year old. She picked it out. She's had this case almost 2 months & is still happy with it. Keep in mind she is very careful with her phone so can't say much about protection & sturdiness as I don't think she's ever dropped it or anything.
NEG 	Fits great and my daughter loves it!!
NEG 	I like that 4 were included and they work fine. The free case that comes with it is a bit flimsy but it was free (part of the combo) so cant really complain about that. Overall good value.
NEG 	Adhesive tape on the back is not the best, I had to take electrical tape and reinforce some areas. Remote is a little cheap, the power button kinda sticks but for the money it's a pretty good buy. I would definitely purchase again. They look so dope.
NEG 	The pan scratched easily. Used about 10 or so times. But it does what I need it to do.
NEG 	Very good...just the way I like this candy.
NEG 	I swear by this dry shampoo and depend on it somedays, I would always run out when I needed it most, so I decided to order in bulk from here to reduce the cost and have more on hand (win, win). The 4 star is for the fact that the only one they sold in bulk was this one and it smells funny. I feel like I'm 30 going on 60 when I spray the product, yet I will say the smell subsides some after a while. Needless to say this is a quick fix, wash your hair freshly before a date.
NEG 	We bought water filters for our refrigerator. They were much cheaper than in the store and seem to be just the same. Order was received quickly and was easy to install
NEG 	I have pets, so I love using this on my rug to freshen them up. I only gave 4 star because of the cost.
NEG 	This has not been installed yet. But I was happy to find one exactly like the one being replaced, which is almost 20 years old. Hoping to encounter no installation issues! (Waiting on a relative to help with the install).
NEG 	Well you get alot of them in different lengths and colors.Have yet to see how sturdy they are.Was hopeing for some larger heavy duty ones.
NEG 	Using these to mark our driveway. Very light, efficient and attractive.
NEG 	Doesn't stick as well as expected.
NEG 	fits good and just as descibed
NEG 	If I put it in the next year will up date
NEG 	Paid for itself in first use. I resized about 5 watches in under 2 hours and did everything from replacing spring bars to watch bands. Didn’t use battery removal tool because I read on reviews this didn’t have a piece to compress the watch backs after opening and indeed it doesn’t! But for $12 it’s worth the price. The quality of the tools is 4 stars, the 2 pronged pin punch broke on one side but other than that it’s worth it. Only one broke and I didn’t really need it so it’s a steal at this price. Do it!
NEG 	VERY bright, almost too bright.
NEG 	Lots of compliments and the design and colors are really cute which is why I give it a 4. But rather tiny on, No support in the breast area at all. Strings in the back aren't really long either.
NEG 	the toothbrush was a gift and it works very well for a 10 yr old.
NEG 	Did not like the licorice ones and seemed to be a lot of them !!
NEG 	Not a bad product for your money! I basically bought it simply for the step tracking, which seems to be accurate. Battery life seems to be a bit short. I’m charging it every 2ish days. This was a much cheaper option that buying a new Fit-bit. Overall, it’s a simple tracker with a simple app, nothing extra or fancy. So if that’s what you’re looking for, I would recommend this.
NEG 	This chair replaced one that I used to think was comfortable. But this chair makes the other seem like I was sitting on a concrete block. The chair only took about 20 minutes to assemble. Basically add the castors, the hydraulic piston, drop the seat onto it and attach the arms and seat-back. Just make sure not to fully tighten the screws until all are in. The levers to actuate the height and rocker are attached to the bottom of the seat and use cables. They're much easier to find than to search around for a lever that is floating in midair somewhere under the seat. My only complaint is that one cannot lock the rocker in any position. It's either locked on not. I like to be able to lock it halfway sometimes just to find the sweet spot. Can't do that with this one. All in all, I'm happy with this chair and hope the comfort doesn't fade away as many office chairs do after it's well worn in.
NEG 	Great for the 3 games it has. It does take some time to put together, but anything with all those pieces would and the instructions were easy to follow. Our little kiddos (ages 7, 6, and 4) LOVE this table and are playing on it constantly!
NEG 	I like the bag and the color... very usefull for my needs
NEG 	This product seems to be working well and helping with my sugar and carb cravings. It's kind of pricey so I'm trying this bottle to see if I notice any results in weight loss, energy or some other measurable means of determining if it's helping or not.
NEG 	Need to be a little more slimmer around the legs
NEG 	The outter box was a little banged up, however the inner box was in good shape and great for gift packaging. The watch is beautiful! :-)
NEG 	Nice fan but wish the controls were more of a push button type (instead of twist).
NEG 	Excellent. Worked perfectly.
NEG 	It’s quite heavy and does its job! The manual script can add more detail to be clear without wondering... However I got one defected screw, will contact tomorrow hopefully will send me a replacement screw...
NEG 	I am a Brazilian jiu jitsu practitioner, and this is my favorite rash guard. It has held up well in 2-4 days per week of training and it shows few signs of wearing out anytime soon. I love the side vents in the underarms. I cannot say if it truly makes a big difference, but it certainly feels much better. The only complain I have is that the hem of one sleeve is coming undone quite rapidly. This is no problem to me because I can fix it easily, but I would have preferred it need a bit longer before necessitating repairs.
NEG 	Had the flu and and took this and it helped get over my flu that lased about a month.
NEG 	This overall is a good case. Strong sturdy stand (after returning two with crappy stands I appreciate the the quality on this one). Only negatives; very hard to silence my phone (no long finger nails) and the volume buttons are also a bit hard to control.
NEG 	Overall, I think the quality is very good for the price. The only issue I have is that the back is quite loose on one of the studs and I'm afraid I'll lose it sooner rather than later. Tried several other backs I had here, but none helped. Kind of strange because the back fits very tight on the other earring. Otherwise beautiful earrings.
NEG 	The mask is comfortable and does not hinder sleep. It has slid off a few times, but not excessively. No light gets in.
NEG 	Nice enough pepper mill.
NEG 	This game is BEAUTIFUL. The graphics are amazing and the game lives up to its name. SO MANY COLORS. But, my only complaint is that sonic is a little hard to control at times but other than that, this game is one of the best on the wii. (I have a wii u but it still works.)
NEG 	I bought this as a gift for a friend. It showed up fast as expected, and it fit her ear perfectly. However, there was some difficulty with closing the clasp. Not that big of a deal but worth noting. Beautiful product, just like its picture!
NEG 	My wife and I take six pills a day and are very easy to swallow. I have trusted this brand for almost two years and it has the most affordable price in the market. We have been taking it by its nutritional values other than trying to cure any ailments. I the past we used the Sun Chlorella but their prices are up in the sky.
NEG 	My husband and I recently laid sheet vinyl ourselves in our kitchen. Being the complete newbies in DIY flooring we are, there were very noticable seams in the floor where a new sheet began so I wanted a rug big enough to cover them up. I wanted a 4 ft x 5 ft rug because that's how big my space was, and this was one of the only ones I could find in the material/colors I wanted in that size. Our flooring is true white & gray hexagon sheet vinyl. I read reviews that said that the rug was definitely off-white instead of true white, but i loved the print, the size and the material seemed perfect for a kitchen. Since our flooring is so stark white,by comparison it makes the rug seem even more brown than white. But, we plan to paint our lower cabinets black and install butcher block wood countertops so I'm thinking the colors of the rug will match better (the off-white/brown colors in the rug will pop with the countertops). So, to summarize, PROS: -I LOVE the pattern of the rug -the material seems very easy to clean in a kitchen (or outdoors) -it is pretty soft (not plasticy or scratchy like some rugs) considering it can be used as an outdoor rug -the size fits perfect in my space -THE PRICE IS AMAZING. BEST VALUE! CONS: -if you're putting the rug against a stark white floor or furniture, the rug will appear to be BROWN rather than off-white
NEG 	Pretty good ingredients and flavor, but not enough to justify the price. Also tends to foam up when shaken. Others I have tried don't do this. Be careful opening your shaker after a good mixing, contents under pressure.
NEG 	Just like I ordered.
NEG 	Worked great but I do not recommend using this with a zero turn mower. I couldn’t reach the lever to activate the spreading. Will pour continuously when not in motion with the lever set, unlike some spreaders. Let’s juat say I put a lot on the ground in one spot. But, very even spread and worked great. Assembled in about 25 minutes.
NEG 	A basic fan with minimum functions, but does its job. Good deal for the price and it looks nice and simple (not bulky at all)!
NEG 	Good quality; slightly smaller than specified. You should allow about 1-2 inches more or it won't fit.
NEG 	Nice case but material is a little to thin for my phone. And it does not have a side slot to put money in. And my license and credit card is hard to put in the slots they say you can put them in. I like the color.
NEG 	Look really nice. They are just a hair bigger than the stock letters.
NEG 	If you're not "handy", find someone who is to help you. My friend agreed to help me and it took us about and hour and a half to assemble. There were a couple of false starts involving using the wrong screws in the wrong places. After that our only problem was that instead of sending me a front right leg and a back right leg, both legs were identical, so we would not be able to assemble the wheels. Fortunately, my friend has a center punch and a drill press, so I wasn't forced to wait for the vendor to replace the leg I needed. As far as using the grill, it did a great job smoking a pork shoulder, cooking hamburgers and brats, and cooking a rack of baby back ribs. I did not expect the mess it makes. A lot of greasy ash is left in the bottom of the chamber. (Hint: do not use your household vacuum cleaner to get the ash out.) Having only used gas and charcoal before and having spent more for this grill than any I've ever owned, I wanted to keep it in tip top shape so I've been cleaning it after every couple of uses. Gas is cleaner, although you have the drip pan to deal with and of course the cooking grate itself. The thing is with this kind of grill, you have additional devices inside the chamber. The drip shelf is meant to be wrapped (instructions said "warp") in aluminum file and that helps somewhat, but it still needs a little cleaning. The heat dispersion thing-a-ma-jig gets covered with ash so it needs to be cleaned. Overall, the cooking's the thing and this works better than anything I've ever had. Temperature control is very easy and accurate.
NEG 	Just when I thought the book was ending, did I realize that was just setting up the rest of the story. Good pace and quality writing kept me entertained and playing along at home. Looking to read the next in the series.
NEG 	I really like this hat, and I like that it's full-coverage but still gives me the option to wear my hair in a ponytail or bun while I'll wearing it. The biggest downside is the way that the Velcro is on the hat - the "sticky" side faces in, so if you don't attach it all the way, it will snag your hair. I have a relatively large head, so I keep snagging my hair every time I take the hat off. It's not a total deal breaker for me, but it's super annoying.
NEG 	Would be better if my pop went up +1 on small houses
NEG 	I love the uniqueness of the product and I appreciate receiving it in a timely manner.
NEG 	What a Ride! Fast paced and full of unexpected twists, this ride is fun and frustratingly captures the reader with an unexpected ending.
NEG 	But still had to give 4 stars. These are super heavy and as a not-so-strong female, I have a very hard time lugging them around! But they are perfect if you're strong enough to handle them.
NEG 	I'd like give five stars to this nice bottle, I think materials and styling are good, it is one of the more aesthetic from all similar products; I love how it looks but its performance it's simply not perfect. I put some ice on cold tea at 6 am and just three hours later it had melted your drinks will not heat along the day but won't keeps as fresh as you wish either, I think the weak part of the bottle is the neck it clearly gains (o loses) temperature there, insulation seems to be defective right there.
NEG 	I have been using this product for years and have never had a problem but this most recent shipment smells like it's gone rancid. :(
NEG 	Fit on our old son's old Solo Beats now Dad has his own.
NEG 	Nice product, easy to carry
NEG 	I got this to wear as I am growing my hair out it is super cute and will look really cute on. It is a good length and comfortable to wear. Nice item.
NEG 	We purchased two of these. One brand new and one open box. The open box one was missing a ratchet strap but luckily we had some extras. Assembly was a little difficult but we figured it out eventually. The ratchet straps aren't the highest quality so if you're going long distance you'll want to stop every once in a while to check and tighten your straps.
NEG 	Easy for kids to use. I have a 5 year old and 3 year old grandkids. They were both able to toss into the air and loved playing with them. Just make sure you don't have to have them right away. Took long time for shipping!
NEG 	These work well for us and seem to be washing up well, but they don't seem like they are going to last until potty training. However, for the price, you can't go wrong!
NEG 	I love my shoes.. I need in other colors.
NEG 	This book is superb and uncommonly informative.This book is sensible for individuals of every kind conceivable! I trust is that this accumulation of sound moment pot formulas will help lead you and your friends and family to more positive way of life. These conditions are certainly not hard to make and delectable. An extensive fragment of them are appropriate for individuals in Ketogenic Die, Low carb Diet, Atkins Diet, Paleo Diet, Vegan and Vegetarian Diet. They are all things considered strong and will do unprecedented to your weight
NEG 	I got this sample size protein cookies and I really enjoyed it. It taste like chocolate chip but you also get the protein flavor in it which I don't mind. Perfect snack during the day
NEG 	Works great took the squeaking out and looks great
NEG 	Loved the book until the end. Just would have liked a different ending. Overall I enjoyed reading!
NEG 	Got it for my boyfriend's Honda Acura. It was a bitch to put on but with some work it got on.
NEG 	Look exactly as pictured. They come in 3 pieces and are easy to put together. They seem like they will hold up as well as any other toilet brush. Great value for the price
NEG 	I love the pants, however the colors aren’t the same as in the stock photo. Wish they were more like that, but they’re still ok. 🙂
NEG 	Work as advertised and easy to install. Will handle round bales of hay without issue.
NEG 	The magnifying glass, light, and UV light work great. My review is only four stars only because the magnification wasn't as good as I would have liked. I got it to view the GIA inscription on a diamond, and I could not do that with this product.
NEG 	Works as described and is very efficient!
NEG 	They told me I could get a free one as a complimentary
NEG 	Slow start but good story for a beginning to a series. I will buy more now that I’m hooked. Thanks
NEG 	I read a different author's dragon story before this one and was a little hesitant to read this one. Fortunately, this one raised the bar back to where it should be and I am looking forward to reading more by this author both in this series and the others. Only reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars is that I found the ending slightly predictable.
NEG 	If you are looking for lightweight you will like.
NEG 	Smaller than anticipated. Maybe 4" X 4". My personalization was done perfectly punctuation & all.
NEG 	They are definitely not ivory. I would say they are definitely either linen or burlap in color. The lace edges are also a linen/burlap color not white as I was expecting. I did get a good deal on these and I do think they go well with the industrial/farmhouse look I was going for. You definitely can hang them without clips on the curtain rods they have a slit for it!
NEG 	I am pre-planning my road trip to Alaska in the motorhome and am surprised with all of the camping options
NEG 	Better then average, and good KNOWN brand item..
NEG 	Easy to install but first one broke after first drop. I'd much rather that than my phone breaking though, so that's why I get multipacks
NEG 	I am not a groomer but need to clean up areas in my little dogs. These scissors worked well for my purpose.
NEG 	Beautiful hair. My only issue was that it was itchy. I guess I'm allergic. Had to take it out early.
NEG 	This is a very convenient way to carry additional credit cards and business cards.
NEG 	Product was deliver on time & kids love it
NEG 	Really do a decent rinse on the charcoal. I thought i did, still turned water very dark.
NEG 	Got it for my 16yr old. She seems to like them.
NEG 	Nice costume, overall good quality alittle to expensive
NEG 	$27 for a metal dress form was a great price. All the hardware was included. It was securely packaged for shipping without damage. The entire thing is of a thinner metal but what would you expect for $27 delivered? I couldn’t event find a used one for that price. I. Very happy with my purchase.
NEG 	Very sexy and fits well
NEG 	Fantastic cover for your bed. Installation was a breeze. Great value for the money. I do wish it had better sealing at the back of the bed, you will definitely need to get some rubber stripping to prevent rain water from leaking in. I used this for a road trip to keep all my stuff in the bed of my truck. I couldn't ask for more. I does feel thin and maybe a little flimsy, but nothing has ripped and I'm very happy with this.
NEG 	Great fit, comfortable and pretty colors
NEG 	A little bit larger than I expected, but my feet still fit in the shoe. A great shoe, and great service.
NEG 	I've read a lot of WWII history, and I only knew about the invasion of Alaska because a friend's father had served in the Navy up there during the war. This book gives a good insight into the mindset of both sides.
NEG 	Even though the boots are a little large putting paper or a sock in the toe of the boot will help and he will be able to wear the boots next year
NEG 	It was a page turner and a good mystery. I enjoyed reading it. I cant wait the read her next installment
NEG 	I bought this pan strictly to have for my evening popcorn. It is extremely light weight and is fine for this application.
NEG 	WORKS GREAT FOR THE FOOT RECOVERY
NEG 	Don't want to hear the same music almost every day....
NEG 	Timely and interesting read on todays new marketing frontier of social media . Gary tells it like it is and makes it easy to understand what your company needs to do to be effective.
NEG 	Product came in great condition. Definitely use this while standing at a desk. Walking is way too painful but sitting won't apply enough pressure. I'm happy with the product quality but is it actually helping with anything? I don't think I've used it enough to really know.
NEG 	The Saga ends. It ends on a high note but itwas difficult getting there.Jacob continues to act foolishly and he and Maggie spend most of the book arguing. Interesting she seemed to get along better with other male characters throughout the series.They are not very loving and don't seem to be able to discuss their issues. It isn't until the last few pages that decide whether they want to go back to the old homestead. Never talk about having any more children.
NEG 	Not bad if you need a holster right away. It's inexpensive and does the job. I would definitely upgrade though
NEG 	Good product- just wish the clay wouldn’t have cracked
NEG 	I ordered the S/M/L and I am 5'5" 140 lbs and they fit really well. I have not yet washed them but they are super comfortable. The fleece lining is warm but not over the top. My only issue is they come up so high on the waist, but I just fold the top down.
NEG 	Bought something to keep my internet router cool; wanted it to be able to be powered off of the actual USB port on the router itself. This thing did the trick; the 1.0A that the USB port provides was enough to power this little baby at the max setting. Speaking about settings; this thing puts out some good air. I'm really impressed! The top setting is substantially better than most AC-outlet fans and i'm not exaggerating about that. The one con I found was that it's starting to rattle a bit after only a week of use. Granted, I have it running constantly. And it's not very loud rattles, just abnormal and slightly noticeable. This won't be a problem though as long as it doesn't get any louder.
NEG 	I bought it to take to Disney with my small children and it was PERFECT! Lg. Side pockets for our theme park cups or wipes, insulated front pocket for food and drink, and a small back pocket for my ID + keys. Large inner pockets that fit diapers perfectly. The bottom back pocket was great for getting autograph books +pens out (repeatedly). I highly recommend this bag!
NEG 	so i really like these scrubs but i Mee to complain about one thing... why isn't there more room in the thigh and crotch area? scrubs are supposed to be loose and comfortable, these are more like pants. nice pants but pants none the less.
NEG 	Our guest who wore this took it off and put back on all nite... made him smile... winner winner
NEG 	Sorry for writing a bad review previously, it was the chrome ones that sucked.
NEG 	It's a good game but when you run out of power ups the only way to get more is to use real cash because the game doesn't give you more power ups i wish that you could win more power ups by playing the game.
NEG 	Loved it. I couldn't put it down until I was done.
NEG 	I gave this as a White Elephant Christmas gift. It was a hit. The titles of the recipes are hilarious.
NEG 	It is really very helpful book. This is a very useful and informative guide. This book helped me have a much better understanding of mind and anxiety disorders. The author has done an excellent job when writing. Thank you author.
NEG 	I wear these to work. Great sound quality and long lasting. Will purchase again. Last at least 8hrs of playtime.
NEG 	Should of got size down but still like and use
NEG 	I bought it for my elderly grandma, and she had shown it to everyone nearby, i am sure she loves it !
NEG 	Love it.. Smaller then expected but works well!
NEG 	The camera works very efficiently. There was some difficulty connecting to the camera from work whilst it was recording at home however the instructions manual helped fix this problem. Good quality and purchase overall!
NEG 	Gets Hot which I like but I feel like it doesn’t straighten my hair to the extent that I need it to. I have thick hair
NEG 	They are perfect. I had to use them for my dog and his formula worked smoothly in them. I definitely will be buying more.
NEG 	Super cute and good amount, wished it had better tracking
NEG 	I was looking for a good tumeric product to help with arthritis in my knees. I have just placed my second order as I am seeing results. I will continue ordering!
NEG 	I liked how sleek the air purifier looks; it fits well with the aesthetic of the room. It is pretty soft as far as noise level goes, but it certainly isn't unnoticeable. I appreciate the light indicating the 'quality of the air' of the room. Very easy to assemble and replace filters. Overall, happy with the purchase! I tried this product because Renpho is a brand I have come to find quality with excellent customer service. I can't give it a 5 because it is still pretty expensive and the noise level is noticeable, but still a great product.
NEG 	I ordered my case after I placed my order for my phone. I didn’t want to risk having no case on my phone. My phone hasn’t came in yet so I can’t say how well the case fits my phone. But I do love the colors on the case and it doesn’t look too bulky. I am pretty sure it will be a good fit. Hopefully will know soon 😃
NEG 	Who needs a working heating system in your room when you have this blanket? I actually get too hot at night, so I can't imagine what it would be like to own this in a house where your heat works! Am curious to know about how it will fare in the summer, though...
NEG 	nice set of brushes. great for plein air painting and keeping your painting supplies well organized. would recommend to others. seller was fast and efficient in getting my purchases to me.
NEG 	I'm ordering another hat I just wish they had more colors or even solid colors to choose from.
NEG 	Love the liquid chalk, but wish some of the markers were not so big and had a problem with one of the markers leaking a bit when I shook it. So...when you shake the markers, make sure you leave the lid on. Other than that, the markers work good.
NEG 	The shower chair was easy to put together and the grip bar was easy to attach to the shower wall and it didn't come off like another one that I bought and had to return. I like the chair because it it is lite and easy to carry around in the bathroom. A good deal.
NEG 	Love that you can add a headboard and footboard. Had terrible time screwing in legs, some areas seem to be cross threaded or threads damaged. Needed a frame that doesn’t roll and this one fit the bill. Very sturdy and stable.
NEG 	This does the job perfectly. I was hoping the color was more bronze but they look more like black.
NEG 	These are good quality pants and I can tell they are warm and definitely waterproof. My biggest concern was sizing. I ordered a large (5’6” 140lbs) and they fit just fine... I have plenty of room to wear another layer under for my trip since it’s going to be very cold. They don’t look very flattering though! But good enough for snow pants.
NEG 	Great size, larger than I expected so this was a great deal. Sturdy material, not flimsy that I can tell. It did come damaged a bit but it’s a trash can so whatever. Would buy again if I needed more trash cans this size.
NEG 	The tape separates from the lights so you can hang them
NEG 	Feels well made sturdy bolted right up to my ar15. For the price not bad at all. The only down side is if the legs are not fully extended and bumped the legs tend to automatically extend.
NEG 	Settings aren’t adjustable it’s pretty much all or nothing. Plays random songs such as Beethoven, happy birthday and merry christmas
NEG 	there could be more room in main pouch but overall a good backpack, comfortable to carry and very well made.
NEG 	We are using the TV as a monitor for the security cameras at our church. The picture quality for the cameras is very good. The only reason I did not rate it a 5 is because we are not using the sound so I don't know the sound quality.
NEG 	Very good tasting tea. My wife loves the cherry flavor.
NEG 	I love these mailers! They are easy to use and nice and rigid for mailing certificates.
NEG 	Lots of additional content compared to Sun and Moon, but I think they took out some important story elements. I won't say what to avoid spoilers if you haven't looked into it yet, but the story felt incomplete. Gameplay improved, but story suffered.
NEG 	The markers are very good, they came in excellent conditions. My only remark is they are little markers i would like they came with more product.
NEG 	This is a decent package. The ink doesn't print as dark as I like, but it is usable. The quantity is sufficient, The quality is not as good as the previous package I ordered, but like I said it is readable and that's what counts. It is excellent for the price. Will order again.
NEG 	excellent movie. see a new generation of Jamaican actors
NEG 	These dog toys are very durable and are a great value. My Corgi loves them. They are easy to clean when he brings them in from playing outside, we just run them through the dishwasher.
NEG 	Straws are nice and durable. However they are closer to 9.5 inches long and very thick. They will not fit through the holes in the top of your cups.
NEG 	I like the variety of colors and waterproof bags which can be used for things other than shoes. The only suggestion would be to have bags that are made from a more flexible fabric ; they were a little stiff and harder to pack in your luggage.
NEG 	Pros: Nice compact vacuum with hepa bag. Using for spring cleaning cobwebs and dust, and little messes. Like the retractable cord and variety of attachments. Light weight and not too loud. Cons: wish it had a better little nozzle brush combo. Gets a little warm with use.
NEG 	It has been over 7 years since I have had to replace the bulb in the bug catching light, and it does its job well. The light has two jobs, well, three if you count the whole unit as a night light. First, it heats up the glue pad behind it. This keeps the glue soft, and an easy trap for any bug attracted to the soft blue glow. Secondly, the light serves as the focal point for the flying pests. Hopefully this replacement will last just as long.
NEG 	Has works so far for my 75 pound dog. He tends to pull and it still works
NEG 	Bought this for my one year old grandson and he loves it. He throws it all over and after 6 months it still works. I don’t know who enjoys this toy more me and his father or my grandson. It growls, grumbles and makes fart noises what’s not to like.
NEG 	Seemed to be good quality, but ran huge.
NEG 	as of now the tube is up I will know more about it as time goes on and I have ridden the atv a little more
NEG 	Shakes a lot when going up or moving around the bed. Pretty sturdy otherwise. It’s great for utilizing small spaces. Took me and hubby about 3 hours to assemble, definitely need 2 or more people assembling, instructions are easy to follow. Hubby and I both sleep on the bed, and it’s been good so far!
NEG 	The family enjoyed it, but apparently it was too easy for them.
NEG 	I purchased this product to help relieve my hot flashes. I've only taken it for a couple weeks now, so will have to wait for another month or so before I know the results.
NEG 	I was looking for a cheap headset to use for now since my other headset broke. I went through numerous headsets on Amazon reading all the reviews, this one caught my eye. What I love about this headset is that it’s super comfy and looks great too! Also, the mic is AMAZING. It sounds better than my old Logitech and Corsair headset! However, I did have a hard time connecting the mic, kept saying not supported. Also, the wire for the headphone jack seems a bit broken. You have to move it a certain way for it to actually play in both ears which can get a little annoying but I’m sure I just got unlucky with what they sent me. I also wish the mute button was in a more convienent spot than on top of the ear piece. The USB is only for the lights. I really don’t see the point in this. I wish this was mentioned before I spent 15 minutes figuring out why the USB wasn’t working. Other than that, it’s good for its price! The USB only being for lights should be mentioned somewhere. I bought this headset because it was USB.
NEG 	Loved the fact that this fragrance formula is true to the original. The redesign on the bottle is ok, but I was happy that Amazon stocks this oldie but goodie for me to enjoy. Thanks Amazon!
NEG 	Very cute shoes. They were a bit tight on my daughter even though it was a half size smaller than what she normally wears.
NEG 	It was bigger than I expected. However good quality.
NEG 	great quality- feels great for morning inflammation and sunburned face
NEG 	Colors are a little different than the picture but I'm satisfied
NEG 	Seems to do job so far
NEG 	Yeah, its a good price and the material is nice and not heavy or stifling.
NEG 	This is exactly what i wanted! The only issue is like with any fake jewelry the gold part it comes off from the back neck area :(
NEG 	They only got a 4 because they catch more bugs than they do mice and there is no way to attract termites with a glue trap. You have to try to figure out the air route in apply the trip to it and that's about it.
NEG 	The weight is wonderful and so comforting at night. According to my fitness watch, I'm getting more sleep since I began using the blanket. My biggest complaint is that the blanket will bunch up inside the cover. I ended up just taking the cover off, but it'll be a nightmare to clean if I get something nasty on it.
NEG 	Great for placing nails in tighter spaces. Works as expected and a good little tool to have in your Tool box for household projects. I'd give it 5 stars if it was made of metal.
NEG 	Good amount for a toddler size; the containers were smaller than I imagined they would be but overall great purchase.
NEG 	These are comfortable shoes that seem well made. My only complaint is the "cut-out" around the top of the opening.... it would be better for me if they were higher around the ankle and slightly higher on the back.
NEG 	I love this little snowman. I make wreaths, and he made a cute one. I like that he is holding the sign let it snow. The only problem I had was that it took a very long time for delivery. So long, infact, that I had completely forgotten I had ordered him. I would order again, but give myself a couple of months for delivery...
NEG 	I am really liking this product. We live in a dry climate and it gets cold so I was looking for some paw protection to help with cold day walks, and this has done more then just protect, it has helped our dog's dry paws as well. The only down fall is it takes a bit to "soak" in and hes still quite young, and staying still is hard so I have paw prints, all over the floor until it works in. Not the end of the world, but it is oily so if your picky about your carpet/finished floors try and work it in really well.
NEG 	I got these to double with the microfiber inserts that came with the Alvababy diapers. They work pretty well but I still get some leaks. Overall I would definitely say they have improved the absorbency of the diapers. I love that they are grey because then there are no stains. I also haven’t noticed any lingering smells.
NEG 	These shorts were longer than I expected
NEG 	Bracelets were nice. Wish both were stretchy. One was and the other was adjustable ..a little on the big side
NEG 	Seems to be good quality and roomy enough for everything I need to carry.
NEG 	This is a great case for a 17.3 inch laptop which is my favorite size. However, the bag is not that padded. It would not protect the laptop well if it were accidentally dropped. I had one before that was well-padded, but had to get a new one. Overall, it is good, but I think it should have more padding to protect the laptop.
NEG 	Ok I got this for $85 new and it's sold out now from that seller. For $85 it's 5 stars! The only thing is that the bottom wasnt fully painted. Like they didn't do an even coat of paint. But when I put it together it does look amazing and expensive...Very very story and easy to put together. It also is a good size kinda large. I do love it would buy again at that $85 price only.
NEG 	So far it is up to par for what I'm doing. Doesn't jam and is dumb proof. The only complaint is the boxing. It comes with a set of instructions, 2 Allen wrenches and the nail gun in a box. No packing material whatsoever.
NEG 	It is so detailed! The coloring is perfect. I am giving this as a gift and feel very confident she will love it.
NEG 	For one, I wasn't aware I was buying three BLUE SAGE SMUDGE STICKS... THAT BEING SAID... They were a tad bit on the small side. They are somewhat fragile . Could be more secured. They burn well, if they were more secure they'd be perfect burning. They suit my purpose. I prefer the smell of white sage, so doubt I'll by them again. Overall not bad if you want blue sage.
NEG 	Loved this book. Storyline was wonderful. I am glad that they got their happy ever after ending. I will continue to follow this author.
NEG 	It works and everything but I didn’t like how the beats logo is a different color from the original
NEG 	Thank you to the delivery people , your an awesome delivery person i appreciate you placing the packages where they wouldnt get wet again thank you
NEG 	The hat is very warm and cozy. I was expecting it to be a little bigger but it looks good on me.
NEG 	You have to pull the drawers straight out or they get stuck.
NEG 	This flag pole is made for the wind. So far, it has held up through 50 mph winds, on numerous occasions. It is, as most poles, overpriced. However, it does what it is supposed to do.
NEG 	Love the Monkees. Great CD. Monkees still got it! But, Amazon has lost their touch when packing items. CD case was broken, as it was stuffed in an envelop and sent out to us. Every CD we have ever bought from them has been broken. :(
NEG 	Very good tasting coffee, I was in Costa Rica and this matched the flavor.
NEG 	A bit weird but seeing Eva Green in all her nude glory was a definite pleaser.
NEG 	does not relieve pain but has the fish oil supplements
NEG 	Prefer the bigger ones but these were ok for cooking
NEG 	It is a little bigger than the standard one on your mirror, but I think it will look okay. Great customer service, my original order got lost in the mail and never arrived but they responded to me promptly and sent a replacement that day.
NEG 	Packaged and shipped as advertised. Bummer that the balloons sunk overnight but we heard that there's possibly a helium shortage. Regardless we got other balloons locally and those lasted a day longer. The quality of these balloons may be lesser but for the price, it's hard to compare - thus the one less star.
NEG 	This is an exceptional hoodie. I'm blowing away if I can get that quality for the price I paid! For me the sizes ran just a little tiny bit small. Great product great price. Next time I think I'll order one size larger. But I definitely will be buying more and I encourage you to also.
NEG 	Would have given 5 stars but stone broke second use had to buy replacement
NEG 	Don’t be fooled by all the maternity shoots....this looks great on a curvy woman. 5’3” 180lbs hourglass with a big bust. It fit life a dream! I read something about the arm holes being weird. They were perfect. If you’re not shaped a certain way I’m not sure the belt would stay up. There are no loops for it. It was 90 degree weather I was wearing this in. I wanted modest, beautiful, and cool. Nailed it. I would have given it five stars if it didn’t start to fray on the first wear.
NEG 	Easy to learn. Gets repetitive after awhile but good occasional fun.
NEG 	Mom wanted this as a gift and she loves it
NEG 	Decided after 5 years of my child not sleeping I’d try something new. Item arrived on time. No complaints in flavor from my daughter. The pills are small and dissolve easily. Works like a charm. I give them to her 30 minutes before bedtime and she has been sleeping without problem.
NEG 	Seemed used and returned without proper packaging for wires. Decent massage but for people over 5'6"
NEG 	I was recommended this book in a group and, since I needed something to read and was bored, I read the blurb and was so excited to read this book. A reverse harem, with demons and a sassy heroine? Sign me right up! Although short, this story was pack full of an amazing characters, humor, darkness, and a promise for a unique series that I'm going to eat up every time they're released. I highly recommend! Again, go into this book knowing it's not a full-length novel, but that it doesn't end a cliffhanger either. It was perfect for the price and I can't wait to see what's going to happen next! I fully intend to get the next book as soon as it releases, which is in a few weeks, so I'd jump in on this series now while there's not too many books out yet.
NEG 	Works well. The connectors require a little bit of muscle when connecting to my Harbor Freight solar panel and camper battery, but a tight fit is good. I use it with my 1.5 Amp Harbor Freight solar panel. The small panel has never fully charged the battery on a camping trip. It has a yellow light indicating charging and a green one that indicates full battery. You can’t beat it for the price and ease of installation. Ready to go out of the box.
NEG 	If you need to clean out, this is the stuff. Be prepared to be near the toilet with plenty of time to use it. No cramping or discomfort but lots of action. If you still don't get relief, you should head to the clinic.
NEG 	Really nice looking in person. Keeps everything at temp.
NEG 	This battery has extended the life of my iphone. I was at the point where my phone had to basically live on a charger. However, I do not believe it holds a charge as long as the original factory battery did when it was new. Also, this battery seems to get HOT when the phone is in use. If I play an app on my phone for a while and place the phone in my pocket (there is no protective case on my phone) afterwards, I can feel the heat on my leg. It's borderline between very warm and mildly hot.
NEG 	Purchased for my husband she he can watch deer and wildlife, cant wait to try it out.
NEG 	Product arrived pretty quickly, and in good shape. Quality product, and works well. Only downside was the 2 week shopping window I was given, but it arrived in less than 5 days, so happy about that
NEG 	It's perfect for exactly what I ordered it for. I roll it up on my mat when class is finished, and it keeps the top of the mat perfectly clean. I don't stand on it during class. It's also handy if I need a rolled up bolster during class. Then it's right there! I'm glad I bought it. Price was right.
NEG 	Great value! It Is a great cover when taking notes makes it feel more like paper! I struggled with applying them but I had three so and for the price it was worth it
NEG 	The product application is easy and the detailed instructions are very helpful for a perfect application. I would not recommend this product for fair toned individuals - do a test area first!
NEG 	I like the product a lot and the container it come in
NEG 	I bought it for a gift
NEG 	I enjoyed the characters in the book and look forward to their journeys. This seems more for younger readers but I'm enjoying the story line.
NEG 	The frames are bigger than I excepted, but beautiful quality and faster shipping.
NEG 	Its very hard to get it on correctly but it does stick very good on the edges. I tried a method and it worked the best. Unfortunately it was the 3rd and last screen protector. I feel like its clearer than tempered glass. Wish it was more forgiving on the install. They need to include the best method to install this screen protector.
NEG 	To bab that lifetime maps is the lifetime of the divice. At which they rate at 3 years. Guess it dose not mean my lifetime.
NEG 	These are not quite as good as tupperware, however they are decent and do the job.
NEG 	Looks nice on exterior. Although up close from a view of the back it is very easy to tell that the material is cheap and thin. Not a solid quality product but its looks get the job done for what I needed.
NEG 	Love the style, the fit is one of the most comfortable I've had in a long time although a couple pair do seem a little on the small side.
NEG 	Great feel to the touch, a bit thick but so comfy. Well constructed.
NEG 	So cute, bought a larger size than needed to increase how long it could be worn but seems to be as large as I expected it to be
NEG 	I bought the spare bracket along with a Dual set as a Father's Day gift. My husband either rides with me or our son, but not usually both of us at the same time, so we only needed two main modules. I like the system very much, but wish it had a regular boom mic which would situate the phone button to the rear of the helmet rather than the front. It's a little awkward for me. The wiring for the mic will need to be fastened down somehow. All in all, a small price to pay for this device that creates more social time between riding buddies.
NEG 	Well made just a little disappointed in color
NEG 	Maybe ordered to small size, but felt like it ran small. Ordered specific size, received a “Medium”, very vague. Did not reorder new size as they were so vague. Returned with ease and received refund...thus the 4 stars.
NEG 	The lock is long enough to lock a few bikes. The piece that is used to secure the lock on the bike does not work. You may lose your lock by using the attachment. I did. Just wrap the lock onto the bike for easy storage.
NEG 	For the most part we didn’t use it very often, it isn’t large but it’s another thing to carry with you. You have to assemble it at the table, most places have high chairs or this exact thing at the restaurant. After buying it, we ended up just storing it.
NEG 	For the price, these lights work great. They're bright, small, and easily portable.
NEG 	First set died in about a month, but they replaced for free. Sound quality is great. Customer service is great.
NEG 	I FEEL MORE HYDRATED.
NEG 	Would like s smaller version
NEG 	look good and classy. used for my son's birthday party. everyone loved it. I gave 4 stars because after a couple days the box opens up itself because the lid is not sticking strong enough.
NEG 	Warm and comfortable, but they're about a 1/2 size too big.
NEG 	I like how it really moisturizes your lips although it can be really shiny on your lips
NEG 	Great wallet, arrived very fast and exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a wallet that holds 8 cards and does not have a picture flap. I found this and it fit the bill perfectly (pun intended). The leather is nice and soft, looks durable and the stitching is nice and straight. The pockets are a bit tight with even 1 card in each, but I assume that will loosen up over time. The width is just a touch larger than I would like (but still reasonable), it fits in a back pocket fine but just a touch smaller would be great. Overall very happy with it.
NEG 	This book had me hooked from the beginning. Can't wait to read them all. Fantasy with biblical prophecy in motion.
NEG 	This was a beautiful dress, but it ran too small. I am usually a large I wear 8 to 10. I ordered an extra large and it was still too small
NEG 	Great product and am going to live with what was sent although ordered Insignia Blue and received Grotto Blue. Won't order from them again.
NEG 	These arrived quickly and are as described. I'm knocking off a star because they are not as bright as I was hoping for. Good value, easy install.
NEG 	Really cute, a tad bit small looking, a little smaller than pictured. Very cute though!
NEG 	Allows the air to circulate in and around the bottle while drying. A hygenic place to dry and store the bottle. Can keep the rinse packets inside the stand base.
NEG 	Purchased this for my daughter. She has no complaints.
NEG 	O.K. for the price. Not so sturdy. Was broken in the first 2 days.
NEG 	The picture shows that there are 2 HDMI and 1 VGA ports. There's only 1 VGA & 1 DVI port. It DOES say that in the description, but, as the old saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words!!
NEG 	Light and shiny; a little goes a long way. Love that it’s not filled with tons of chemicals!
NEG 	Super comfortable but the waist is way too big for me. 5'6 140lbs and ordered a medium
NEG 	Lots of leaves. You need to separate them as they clump when cut. They look nice for projects. We added ours for jars with battery tea lights.
NEG 	I missed my rainbow belts from HI, so I thought I'd buy the powder and add it to EVERYTHING! Mango, pineapple, fruit strips, so ono!
NEG 	I use this caddy in my kitchen pantry rather than my bedside. Perfect for my tools I use when when I need quick access. Loving it
NEG 	I love this product and so does my son very helpful. Only downside is that whatever you put in it usually stains but so much better then the cloth version
NEG 	The insole comes lose and sometimes folds and feels uncomfortable. The sole is thin, so walking on rocks can be felt through the sole. They are lightweight, fit good and usually comfortable. The mesh breathes.
NEG 	Great Hair, Definitely 10A Grade
NEG 	My 5lb picky Yorkie will eat it, so what more can I say.
NEG 	I love the design. It is beautiful. But the cut doesn't really fit in and requires quiet a while to install. The bottom 4 corner patches leave black stains on other stuff, so just be aware.
NEG 	Wish they were a touch more rugged though I do understand they are meant to break to protect the moter!
NEG 	Great item! Just as pictured/described.
NEG 	Product was very easy to install, bright and no leakage so far. Only con is that the light doesn't illuminate the truck bed all that well.
NEG 	Not a bad product for the price. Install was 5 minutes.
NEG 	Lets see how it works
NEG 	Product works great. NFC function works great. The build quality could be a little better but all in all I am satisfied
NEG 	You get what you pay for. This is a very basic case for simple builds. I wouldn't recommend it for a serious gaming rig but for basic productivity it works well.
NEG 	Didn't realize that the cutting edge did not go all the way around. It is a beautiful die and I will use it.
NEG 	My two pups love these, but they eat them within 5 minutes. For that reason it doesn’t really help with teething.
NEG 	Works great in my HP ProBook 650 G1 when my stock battery suddenly quit working. I am thinking of selling the laptop, so I did not want to spend a lot of money on a new battery. It works perfectly, although the runtime is shorter than it was on my old battery, which I kind of expected since I had an extended life battery.
NEG 	helps pain in my feet and legs
NEG 	they are nice chains
NEG 	It is a little flimsy but it does exactly what I need it to do! This is a small alternative to larger compasses that don’t fit in my on the go art kit. I would recommend and repurchase in the future!
NEG 	While battery-life of these batteries individually may not be any better than the battery that ships with your GoPro, this bundle definitely helps with longer usage of your GoPro before needing to return back to a wall outlet to charge up your batteries. The "multi-charger" definitely helps too, but it can only charge 2 batteries at once, even though it has room for 3.
NEG 	Helps with stomach irritability, but definitely gave me an odd minty after taste about 45 minutes after ingesting. It takes some time to get used too, but does help with stomach symptoms if taken regularly.
NEG 	Good stories, when you feel like some short SK.
NEG 	We should all have a little Zane in our lives. Divorced 2 years, Dawn decides to take her therapists advice and ends up having mind blowing crazy hot afternoon delight with Zane. I really enjoyed these two as they navigate through her abusive ex, her being older than him and her basic insecurities. This well written short was lots of fun with lots of sexy times that are explosively hot. It was nice to read about a slightly older woman who I could totally relate to. Highly recommend. I received a complimentary copy of this book for voluntary review consideration
NEG 	Lots of frustration at first but then I smacked it with my hand and it started working (not joking). It got recognized and windows automatically found and installed a driver. Sound is good and 5.1. I'm using optical cable from it to my soundbar set up. Running Windows 7. Working flawlessly so far.
NEG 	I think that it is kinda strange that you put a teddy bear button on this, when it is supposed to be for grownups. That is the only thing that I see wrong. If I had known that, I would not have bought it for my grown daughter.
NEG 	Everything about these was as advertised, I was really enjoying them until, just outside the end of the return period, the audio quality coming out of my buds became tinny and fuzzy out of the blue. Nothing I have done seems to be able to restore audio quality. Don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting audiophile quality here at this price, but they sound like AM radio right now out of every device I connect them to. Unless I have a faulty unit (very possible here I guess), I'd recommend spending your money on a competitor. [edit / manufacturer graciously reached out after seeing this review and sent a replacement. the new unit is as advertised: solid budget level noise canceling. :)]
NEG 	I like the packaging and the pistol grip sprayer. Not using long enough to see results. It is a bit oily and has a distinct smell....not objectionable but not pleasant either. I am applying it to my husband’s hip for arthritis. He is okay with the feel of it. Only used for a couple of days applying at night in bed. He did not feel instant relief but did say he felt a bit better in the morning. Hence the four stars. I am hopeful that with time the results will be even better.
NEG 	only drawback is that the front and back patters don't meet up, but that's a minor gripe. For the price it's pretty cool.
NEG 	I liked these containers, although they were not made of the strongest material. They are microwave safe which is always nice. The sizing of the partitioned areas within the container are perfect for lunches. The containers themselves are much larger than I originally anticipated, but are still a great size to take lunch to work or to prep for meals. The ability to reuse them is great for anyone looking to reduce their waste.
NEG 	Very nice product for the money
NEG 	These are great however if you are using them in an area that gets humid, expect the shelves to warp. We had to replace the shelves with boards.
NEG 	it's okay the stars aren't as clear as i would have liked but it does the trick the baby loves it. Wish it had some kind of music and more colors
NEG 	Bought this globe as a gift, however the globe we received had a slightly bent frame so that it would rub against it when spinning. Novo Basics has such outstanding customer service. They emailed checking on the quality of the globe. When I told them the problem, they immediately sent a new one. So 5 stars for customer service, but I did subtract one star off because of initial problem and because the second globe I needed to tighten the base screw. The globe itself has good graphics and a clean design. In all, I would recommend this product/company if you are looking to get a decent globe. Thank you Novo for great customer service.
NEG 	It’s good but it has some level of noise.
NEG 	Everything was just as expected!
NEG 	Okay, similar to the clips in RV. I would like to see a better quality material.
NEG 	They're good envelopes, no complaints.
NEG 	The sheets are bright and colorful. It’s exactly what I needed for daily organizing. Unfortunately due to poor packaging it arrived crinkled and bent about halfway through on the top... which will drive me crazy that the Pages arent straight 🙄
NEG 	They seem rather tight, but most likely need to be broken in a bit.
NEG 	They are a little snug
NEG 	planted these one week ago and three have already popped thru the surface. If a couple of more pop up I will definitely be 5 stars happy.
NEG 	The ear piece has to be adjusted to the child’s ear.
NEG 	Some of the stuff is flimsy
NEG 	Not an easy read but great material.
NEG 	Maybe I should have bought the turn off switch rather than unplugging it from the TV. Other then that later pic update.
NEG 	My daughter loves it but I will mention that the wire throughout the tunnel hurts the knees when crawling through it.
NEG 	I have done tones of foot peels in the past. This one by far has taken the longest to finished. I started it on Feb 22. I am STILL peeling. It is working, however it seems to be taking FOREVER! I think the value of the product is great. I would certainly recommend to others. My only advice would be NOT to do this during the summer. You will regret it. Unless you plan on wearing sneakers for a few weeks straight. I would try to use this in before you decide to bring your sandals out.
NEG 	The camera itself is unique and was happy when i found the film for my camera. It was good.
NEG 	Fits more like an XL, which is my size and it's very comfortable! I would suggest ordering a size bigger than you normally wear.
NEG 	This book makes it super easy and has a great variety of recipes. The directions are easy to follow. I am very pleased with this book.
NEG 	I haven't bothered to check whether there are better pinball apps for Kindle but this one is pretty alright. Play is a little slow, so if you want to kill time, this is a good way to do it.
NEG 	Dart board very nice, darts are okay the tails keep flying off but all in all good product
NEG 	Bought to help with sleeping as I had read. I forget to take all the time so not sure how well it works but when I do take I think it may help just slightly..
NEG 	Item was as described. Slow shipping, but I didn’t need it quickly. Great price!
NEG 	Very well made but very small. Try ordering a size larger or 2 size larger is possible
NEG 	The toys are quite nice overall, though it appears the balance of a few of them is slightly off, so they, particularly the turtles, are often want to flip over and sort of do a back stroke rather than swimming forward as expected. The other toys all do swim well and look great.
NEG 	They are LARGE. They fit in a regular light bulb socket, no issues. The bulbs are much much larger than a regular bulb though. If you have a tight fit already these will not fit.
NEG 	A little small for me. but does work good
NEG 	The bag is super spacious, great for packing lunch and snacks for long days. The only reason for 4 stars is because the bag keeps the food cool but not for that long. If I take out a fruit snack at the end of the day, it is cool but not cool enough for long enough. I am therefore careful to eat any yogurt snack early in the day because I do not trust the bag.
NEG 	I read the reviews before ordering and i got them and i really like them. Not as true to color as the picture but close enough.
NEG 	Not perfect, but good. American Pie full length version, Awesome !!! Was my first 45 rpm record. I was in 5th grade at the time.
NEG 	This dress was beyond beautiful in detail. This dress was definitely a win! I wish it was a tad bit tighter on areas but realistically it fit perfect! I was constantly complimented. Im 4'9 . Weigh about 128 pounds. Size 28 waist in pants or size 4ish . Tops im s/m
NEG 	Pretty, fluffy pillows. A little overstuffed.
NEG 	It’s super cute and a great price for 2! there are endless possibilities of how to decorate it and i’m so excited to hang polaroids from it.
NEG 	Good protective case, a little heavy and hard to get off. Overall good purchase
NEG 	Nice compact speaker. Not quite enough volume for my needs. Wish it had a manual switch to toggle through the modes. Sound quality is good for a compact speaker.
NEG 	A sweet story but a bit to insecure on the female side. It didn't ruin the story but was more doubt than I like. Loved the male lead.
NEG 	The grease gun can be a little heavy to hold for long periods but it works awesome and has a long battery life! I added a grip tip to it which makes this grease gun even better! I’ve greased many machines with it so far and never lets me down
NEG 	have bought this before and will again
NEG 	It's nice to mix up your face masks it would of been alot better with one round and one square applicator instead of two square ones.
NEG 	I love having a probiotic and vitamin in one and the price is great compared to buying them separately. However, my kiddo is not a fan of the taste and they do have an odd smell. I like the Zarbees brand, so I was hopeful! We'll keep looking for a similar product though because I did notice the health benefit they had. Of course that only works if they kid is willing to take them regularly.
NEG 	I work in the HVAC business and most of my cuts happen to my fingers.
NEG 	This is a super quality cover. It did not fit my zero-turn completely. I have my ROPs folded down but the cover is not long or deep enough. It needs to be at least 12” longer and 24” deeper to fit properly on mine. Part of my deck, half my engine, and front casters are exposed. This cover is suppose to fit a zero-turn but it’s just too small for mine. It would be excellent for a standard mower or garden tractor though. Just wish they offered a larger size and I would definitely order it and use this first one on my standard mower.
NEG 	This banner was adorable!
NEG 	Not quite pro tool quality but all 4 functions are decent. I bought to put on my tractor. I bought the CTA tools and the Trades Pro brand pliers . they were equal in quality and functionality
NEG 	This is just a part of fall and Halloween time; whether mixed with peanuts and bits of chocolate for a party, or as a treat on a rainy afternoon, this is great. However, many of the pieces were broken and stuck together. That doesn't hurt the flavor but does hurt the presentation. I do appreciate the ziplock on the large bag, which helps keep it fresh.
NEG 	I got this to store shoes and slippers by my back door. Does a good job of this, but could be better if it were just a few inches wider. I can get two pairs of wide adult shoes per shelf, with room for about 1-1/2 shoes left over. That extra 3” width would allow 6 pairs instead of 4.
NEG 	The boys liked it but I was disappointed that it did not go very high.
NEG 	Seems like a good screen protector but have only had it installed a month or so. It doesn't quite cover the entire screen prefectly but it is close enough. Also, it is very reflective so I would have preferred a more matte finish. Other than that I like it so far.
NEG 	suction cup works amazingly great. cradle leaves lots of room for improvement but works well enough.
NEG 	I bought this for a causal co-Ed baby shower I was throwing for a friend. The color of the decorations were accurate to the picture. For some reason I thought “it’s a girl” was a balloon so I was disappointed it was only made of cardboard. Lost assembly is required to but it was fairly easy (husband was not happy to be tasked with this job) but the decorations turned out beautifully.
NEG 	Overall I've liked this set over the past few years but it has a few serious design flaws which for me meant that I had to reassemble it using a heavy helping of blue threadlocker after it fell apart in my bag. As a bonus I only managed to lose one of the washers! -The lock washers that are used to hold the thing together are the cut washer type which from an engineering standpoint literally do nothing once everything has been tightened. I supposed they could help in light of the next design flaw I will mention but in my case they didn't. It's truly astonishing that manufacturers have ever used these types of lock washers and completely insane that they continue to do so. -The rods that threads through each end and are responsible for tying all the individual tools together are about 1/4" too short. This means that when you tighten it down you don't tighten against the rod, you tighten against all of the tools. The effect of this is that you can't really tighten them down an effective amount because the individual tools won't be able to swing out. They did put a small dab of blue threadlocker on it but it wasn't enough to prevent mine from falling apart. I suggest that anyone who buys this disassembles it and puts a healthy helping of blue or maybe even red threadlocker on the threads. Once applying a bunch of threadlocker it seems to stay together enough for infrequent use. If you are someone who only has this for emergencies then I consider it a worthwhile tool for your pack. If you are planning on using this frequently then I suggest looking elsewhere. I see a lot of complaints about rust but unfortunately that is the nature of things. Stainless would be too heavy (and softer), aluminum would be too soft, and titanium would be too expensive. I suppose there could be a better coating on it but in the end you just need to not let it sit around wet. Keeping it slightly oiled would also help.
NEG 	I loved the feel of this phone IMMEDIATELY. However, first PAY ATTENTION if you have TMobile or the Walmart family plan TMobile ......Pay attention to the specific bands the phone picks up vs your carrier! I was unaware this phone will not pick up 4G if you habe TMobile. Otherwise phone seemed just what I was looking for.
NEG 	I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN
NEG 	My husband loved these.
NEG 	Love the food!!! HOWEVER the shipping is not so great...second shipment that had a blade slash (not on a seam) that had food spilling into the box it was shipped in. I knew this time to open it outside just in case and sure enough out poured food onto my sidewalk and i later had a possum outside in my trash and near my porch eating it. I also have had an issue 3 times with FedEx claiming they attempted to deliver it while i was home and this time they didnt even leave a door tag but i got an email stating it was undeliverable due to noone being home (yeah OK) SO i had to wait til the next day to recieve it after attempting to complain to the local Fedex office that keeps packages undelivered and has no phone # directly . Sorry to the manufacturer and seller me and my dogs love this food (seafood and chicken) and it lasts my 4 medium size dogs almost a month but the shipper and Fedex have GOT to get it together.
NEG 	I really like the awesome sound. I like that I can share one earbud with someone else while listening to music. However, the description states that incoming voice conversation is transmitted in right earbud only. If you are sharing the left earbud with someone else while listening to music, they can also hear your audio conversation. Disappointing. Also, Reception range is rather short. I do like the self-charging feature case ( I can get several charges with the case before charging the storage case itself.) The case is small enough to fit in my pocket or purse. With this being said, I am still okay with my purchase.
NEG 	I would say it is prefect and could be compatible with ring,however it is not easy for assembling if you don't have an existing doorbell,you have to use a drill to make a hole on door and connect with wire.
NEG 	Surprising very impressed with the fit and quality of these. I ordered 2 pairs in different colors. They both have a very similar fit, but a little different in the toe area (one was suede and the other was canvas though). Overall, I really like these. There was no breaking in and no blistering, which says alot in my opinion. Very comfortable too. These are my everyday shoes for work and home.
NEG 	JUST RIGHT! Sticks on and protects. Very absorbent for spills. Large coverage area.....
NEG 	Wasn't quite as big as I thought it would be. However, I take quite a few overnight trips and it's held up well. Overall I'm not disappointed
NEG 	The bad: The touch is not that sensitive The good : works great with google home
NEG 	Enjoyed the journey. I have known through hikers and the other people that call them idiots or comment "why would you ever want to do that". Simply for the fact that he could, he did. Push yourself to hike your hike in whatever facet of life you want to focus on. It was a relatable, an honest story of struggle, mistakes, little victories and finishing what he set out to do. Enjoyed it very much.
NEG 	The product looks just like the picture. I wish I could have give 3 4/5 stars. Because I am not sure I like it. I does not warm my neck like advertised. But does shut-off frequently.
NEG 	Filter is a perfect fit but the sensor was not. I was able to use the old sensor, but the sensor was a part of the reason for the purchase, so 4 stars.
NEG 	Does it whiten? Not sure but it makes my teeth feel clean.
NEG 	Just got the bag. Very cute, good quality and larger than I expected but it is labeled as a lounge fly bag. It's is not made by lounge fly. So if you are looking for a lounge fly bag this isn't it. But still worth the purchase.
NEG 	Very Comfortable and pretty but I bought a 1/2 size larger due to other reviews and they do run slightly on the smaller size
NEG 	Fits almost anything
NEG 	Its a great learning book about lean mastery. A great informative book. Learning approach. Providing proven tips and steps. Appreciating content. Recommended.
NEG 	Good for the cost. And for the first trial run. Not expecting much for the :$$ but I'm happy with it besides it could have better adhesion but I fixed that with 3m double sided tape
NEG 	I really like the magnetic calendars. They fit nicely on my fridge and will get a ton of use. I love that the eraser also had a magnet in it to stick on the fridge! The markers have magnets on them as well as eraser ends. The only minor recommendation I would have for the manufacturer is to make the background for the month white instead of black so you can actually see the written month. I would have given 5 stars if it weren’t for that.
NEG 	Great book bag used it to charge my phone and for college and work but on rainy days my stuff gets wet and the charging port is not glued in place or something which gets pushed back
NEG 	The Inn at Holiday Bay; Boxes in the Basement is the first in a new series by Kathi Daley. I really enjoyed this charming cozy mystery where everything in town is named after something related to a holiday! Abby Sullivan is ready to get on with her life after suffering a terrible loss. Buying an old house in Holiday Bay, Main turns out to be just the project she needs. As she's getting settled, a mystery starts to unfold. Helping to solve this mystery, starting to renovate the house and getting to know her new friends (including Rufus the cat and Georgia along with her dog, Ramos), gives her the push she needs to want to write again and live life to the fullest. The cast of characters are fantastic and I look forward to what happens next in Holiday Bay!
NEG 	I’d rather have the full website easier to read easier to use
NEG 	Useful information, more for beginners to the wine wold, but still some interesting facts and philosophical tenets.
NEG 	Needed something to listen to and stumbled across this book. Didn't expect to like it as much. Not bad! Ok
NEG 	I did notice that when I take this my thinking seems to be better.
NEG 	The illustrations and information offer helpful insight to animal forms, movement and structural variations. Very good - would recommend.
NEG 	Works great for your backseat. It’s not as long as a regular air mattress since it has to go perpendicular to your car. If your sears all lay flat, go with a different air mattress so you have more room to lay down. The quality of this isn’t the best but it’s worth what they are charging.
NEG 	Bought in the summer time and it’s quite thick and my baby was super hot in it. I can’t use it for when I need it.
NEG 	Super cute product for little girls room. Large enough to cover most of the wall. Would suggest buying wall paper adhesive as well because some of the leaves and branches will keep peeling.
NEG 	These fit slightly snug on me. Nothing constricting, but tighter than my other options. Be aware there is NO FLY on these. You have to drop them down to relieve yourself.
NEG 	My go to energy source.
NEG 	I got this for my daughter to use when we go for long drives. It’s soft and comfortable. Offers support for her neck when she sleeps. It is washable but I’m not sure if the padding won’t fall apart, looks like it wasn’t sewn well. Still, it does what it needs to do. My daughter likes it.
NEG 	Astounding book!! This book gripped me like no romance novel has in some time- and I read a lot! The love scenes were excellent but could be more detailed. It was emotional and really just a great read.
NEG 	Very nice material, a little tight in the chest. Perfect length to wear with leggings or jeans,
NEG 	This book is a great coffee table book, it has some amazing photographs and a lot of simple straightforward explanations of what you are looking at, it is in fact other-worldly. the 3D is best on some of the craters and canyons. Good gift for any friends or family who like astronomy or science.
NEG 	Very very loosely was the movie attached to these stories. The movies had better ideas. But these stories were fairly entertaining and keeps one thinking as to what is going to happen next.
NEG 	Cute and great case- flexible casing as well.
NEG 	Works pretty well so far. The only issue I have is the filter container doesn't seem to lock down on both sides. Seems likely an issue with the lid as it is just little plastic extrusions that hold it in place to keep it from floating around in there and one side just doesn't seem to hold, the other side does though so it keeps the grounds at the water level and function is not impaired. Makes great cold brew though with limited sediment, I could probably use a better grinder for this purpose.
NEG 	I like the hand set / speaker set so when I am off road and communicating with others in our group I can have the transceiver stationary and set the hand set / speaker nearby without having the transceiver attached to my body
NEG 	Direct readout of carbon monoxide level was the main reason for buying this particular unit. The unit works well but the instructions are not very useful. They are plainly written by someone who doesn't speak English. Specs are lacking in that they don't say at what level of CO the alarm will sound, or how long it takes for detection at various levels. Otherwise, the unit works as expected.
NEG 	An Instant Pot comes with lots of benefits. It is just a single kitchen device but it is able to cover the work of many other devices: pressure cooker, rice cooker, steamer, saute-pan, yogurt-maker etc... This book is comprehensive and will deliver some very healthy and delicious Instant Pot recipes which will be very easy and simple to cook ...
NEG 	I really loved these leggings, didn't get baggy over time but they got holes so quickly! Definitely a thinner material, wish they had lasted longer. I don't regret buying them but probably wont buy again.
NEG 	I ordered 10 of these and unfortunately, 2 of them were broken. The pieces were in the packaging. A little disappointing as I hate the hassle of dealing with this kind of stuff. Other than that, the other 8 are adorable.
NEG 	I'm a big fan of cylinders. There are a lot of cylinders in here. Too heavy for hitting kids but just right for a a childish sword fight as long as you're wearing hockey gear.
NEG 	Good product for the price
NEG 	Don’t know until I try to use it
NEG 	Has worked very well for me!
NEG 	Hey, it is Bush's Beans....and a rather tasty variant it is. Plus you don't have to go to the grocery store as often. Win Win
NEG 	Great quality! I bought 3 of these... all three look great. I thought they would have a little blank space between the edges and the letters. The letters go edge to edge. Not like typical military name tapes but great quality. They have the hook side of Velcro stick very nicely without having to worry about it coming loose. I will buy more when I need more.
NEG 	I love the fact that it came with a silicone case and a carrying case and lanyard. I love that it came with its own AAA batteries too. However, I have smaller sized hands than the average person. I'm not sure if I am getting 100% accurate readings because the clamp doesn't seem to clip hard enough on my finger. I have to lightly press it together with my other hand in order for it to be tight enough on my finger to get a reading. I'm not sure if this is normal with all finger heart rate monitors, or if I got a slightly defective one. It seems to be reading okay (eventually), but I'm just assuming.
NEG 	Good case! It’s white so your typical jean stains and what not rub on it. There is the writing on the back next to the camera.
NEG 	Good product, but directions for straps had pictures with black on black images, making it hard to determine how to put straps. Pain was improved within a few hours of wearing.
NEG 	For the price very good!
NEG 	Haven't had to use it yet, and hope I never will. I will have it handy just in case
NEG 	These have largely worked for our team. My girls complain that they smell bad, even after I washed them, but I guess that's just the material. They fit a bit bigger than I expected, but they get the job done.
NEG 	It’s fine looking, a little snug, fabric is pretty thin.
NEG 	.... need a little larger size and a little heaver material..
NEG 	It is good for the value paid. I managed to update the maps for the first time .
NEG 	Haven't used these yet. But they look exactly like advertised.
NEG 	Very firm. No give yet. In guest room so doesn't get much use.
NEG 	Small dent on one of the lips but didn’t affect anything. I have used it serval times already and works great and easy to clean.
NEG 	Pretty chain offers quiet charm and just right thickness. It is somewhat shorter than I expected however but affordable enough to purchase another for layering.
NEG 	I would have given this skirt 5 stars but both pockets had holes in them. Otherwise, nice fit (I am a size 10-12, ordered a Large) and great length.
NEG 	There are some uneven divots or pits in the metal, leaving spots for food and oil can get stuck and slightly difficult to clean. Otherwise it is fairly durable and is priced affordable. As far as versatile oh, well that depends on the chef, you're dealing with a fixed surface size and material. But if you know how to cook... You will have no problem sauteing, frying, Browning and even simmering anything you desire. I just wish it came with a matching cover
NEG 	Buy these all the time. Love them
NEG 	I have worn similar styles from Merrell for the last 7 years. they usually cost about $100, so this is a significant savings. This particular pair seems to run a tad bit small, and tight. I purchased my regular size. Because they are leather I will give them a little time to break in. So, if you decide you want these shoes you may consider purchasing a wider pair.
NEG 	This was an exciting read. My only complaint was the reluctance to address race. I am still not sure if Peter is white or black. It took awhile to acknowledge the color of other characters.I just found that disconcerting. I mean the dog's appearance was loud and clear. I don't care but like to "know" the hero.
NEG 	i love it ..but its goes dead in an hour
NEG 	First attempt in applying came out fairly well, however, all the bubbles did not disappear. Maybe my second will produce better results/
NEG 	It's to big but when you try to do a return, you find out you will get only part of your $, so I will give it away instead.
NEG 	These are the best-fitting ear buds I've ever had. My only complaint is that the wires/cables are tangle prone. Keeping them anyway.
NEG 	Got it today. For the people who write there are no instructions. Go to the description 2nd part they there. I have used different slim patches before. I hope these work for me better. I will keep you posted.
NEG 	It took me a second to get used to it. I was replacing an old timer that I knew by heart. I really like the large display
NEG 	I love almost everything about this lamp. However, it advertises 90 degree adjustable, but it does not adjust 90 degrees like you would think. 45 in each direction but not 90 in each.
NEG 	Grill cover fits nicely, it has not yet rained here so we'll see how it does once we have our first rains
NEG 	Foam yoga blocks vary in density. Some are softer and have more give; others are denser and firmer. These blocks are on the denser side. They have very little give in them. I'm happy with them. The strap, on the other hand, is not so great. It is a very thin material and when I fastened it, I could make it slip by pulling on opposite sides of the buckle. If you use a strap a lot in your practice, I would recommend investing in a different one that is thicker and more substantial. Also, the blocks and strap are not the same shade of purple. The blocks are much lighter than the strap. Personally, I don't care but that matters to some so I'm passing it along.
NEG 	They're foam tiles. Not sure what else there is to say.
NEG 	These only worked on one item.
NEG 	i would give a five-star if the weight were a bit lighter
NEG 	I will order a few more to use in place of those CRAPPY spinning reels that I hate to use .
NEG 	This organizer fits perfectly in my kitchen drawer. Bamboo looks great. Only wish the extension would lock into place- seems a little wobbly when its extended but since it fits the space completly its fine
NEG 	Umbrellas still fall over in the wind and these are filled to the brim with sand. Theyre easy to use and fill and we get some serious wind, but Ive had some that worked better in the past. I wish I could remember where I had gotten them.
NEG 	I like that this allows you to dispense much more precise amounts of food (I was feeding a Beta in a 2 gallon tank). It seemed to work perfectly well; my only complaint was that a good deal of the food stuck to the walls of the food chambers because of what appeared to be static cling. I’m not sure that’s a fault of the product, but I did choose this because I wanted to dispense small amounts of food and this affected the reliability somewhat. I was using very small pellets to feed a Beta, so flakes or larger pellets may not be affected in the same way. Overall, very pleased with the product.
NEG 	Round was not what I was expecting when I received them. But they are great and serve the same purpose!
NEG 	This has a mild chalky taste which isn't too bad, but it does leave a bad after taste in my mouth. I mix it in a little bit of grape juice. I suppose it would taste better in a full glass of juice, but I'm watching my carbs and calories. I'd rather take pills, but these really is the most economical way to go. The body can only absorb 500 mg of calcium at a time, so I need to do this 3-4 times a day for my osteoporosis. It comes with a tiny measuring spoon to measure out 500 or 1000 mg portions. Calcium Citrate is much better absorbed than calcium carbonate. Don't waste your money on calcium carbonate.
NEG 	Great idea, will definitely get you up in the morning. It's biggest drawback is that you should be able to set it over Bluetooth, it is a huge pain to take it out of it's cover and manually program it each time when it could be a simple blue tooth connection.
NEG 	As described. A good exercise tool
NEG 	I love this bed. The price is right, it turned out sturdy and it looks great! I will say that the other reviews are correct tha it’s hard to put together. My fiancé and I ended up using power tools, and it took us a couple hours. We’ve had it over a month though and it’s great. Definitely worth it for the price, just make sure you have some power tools and extra help!
NEG 	Item is as advertised. Would love an option of a finished wood item, but that this natural wood is great. Can't wait to get my record in it!
NEG 	This was a cute gift for my preteen daughter. She played with it a few times, but it was quite messy. I think it served its purpose for what we bought it for, which was a distraction from the screens for at least a little while. LOL
NEG 	This is a great little printer if you get a good one or can figure out little problems. On arrival mine wouldn't home, investigation found tie wraps inside on the bed heater tied to other wires so the bed couldn't travel far enough to home. Also the hot end arrived plugged and I had to dis-assemble to clear. After that it has worked pretty flawlessly for the first three prints..
NEG 	I purchased this to trace my sewing patterns and it's perfect. The weight of paper isn't too light or too heavy. It's really an awesome product for sewing.
NEG 	The group of stories are well put together. It is nice going through them.
NEG 	Bright happy lights. Tons of Stars lights - much more than I thought when ordered. Relieved it arrived ontime despite seller not honoring Prime commitments! Seller Waited to send two days and then put it in the mail! Not cool.
NEG 	Good for my costume-fast ship!
NEG 	Good welds, looks super clean, great if you need a Y tip for a muffler delete. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because when I got them, they had a few Knicks in the blue
NEG 	Feels and looks great, packaged safely. I used some 3m tape I had since the tape it came with wasnt enough to get it to stay smooth. Would need to remove the original emblem or shave it for it to stay flush and perfect.
NEG 	True to description arrived promptly
NEG 	Im 5’7, around 150lb, B cup size and I purchased a medium. I originally got a small based on other reviews, but it made it stretch so much that you could see my undergarments beneath the fabric. It was really easy to return and get a medium, which was much better. It comes to right above my knee cap, unless I make an effort to pull it down, then I can get it below my knees. Overall, it’s a really cute, casual dress and hugs curves nicely. I’ve washed it and it does well in the wash, too- no shrinking or damage.
NEG 	Had to return it tivo did not workout.
NEG 	I like these, just wish that the glow was a bit brighter.
NEG 	This products cleans me out every time I take it. It’s great! NOW on the label it says that it blends well with coffee but it really doesn’t. It’s oil and water they don’t mix duh! I drink black coffee and I can see the pool of oil at the top
NEG 	I help provide professional development on teaching language to students who have limited communication skills. We recommend this product in our training. I have used the Stages Learning Materials Language Builder cards for many years. This set has updated pictures, so the TV looks more like a TV students will see in their home.
NEG 	Smaller than expected but works well
NEG 	Good product, most useful that I've found, but a little flaky with monitor recognition.
NEG 	Love this product! Use it every day. Very universal and can be used for multiple purposes and ways.
NEG 	It works, but you really want to use it in a dark room. it is not very bright, but the remote control come in handy and that fact that it has youtube install already is a plus.
NEG 	The sand is ok, but I guess I should have read the details a little more. The size was so small. You can find a better deal in stores.
NEG 	Is a good quality product, easy to instal and ergonomic.
NEG 	Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this product, except for the fact that I'll have to do some modifications. The fabric super nice and thick, no need to worry about seeing through. I got the red, and it does appear a little bit lighter than the picture when in daylight, but nothing that bothers me too much. I have two very small issues with the dress. The first one is the sleeves have some holes, and they're a little bit too low for my liking, the sleeves are a perfect length for me naturally, and the some holes are a little bit higher up which stretches the fabric. I feel if you had shorter arms, this wouldn't be much of an issue but for me it was since I'm a little bit longer there. My other issues that I'm quite busty, and the corset comes too high up. It comes up about halfway up my bust, so I'm going to remove the top couple fabric eyelets. Overall, this product is perfect if you aren't super tall or busty, but even if you are, they're easy modifications! (Remember to order a size or 2 up!)
NEG 	It was a gift for my son in law. He was thrilled with it.
NEG 	They sound pretty good, considering you are just using them for sleep. They are nice and soft, and MOSTLY comfortable. The only issue I have is that the speaker distance isnt really adjustable, so they dont center on my ears very well. Battery life seems to be fairly low, but they get you through until you fall asleep either way.
NEG 	Seems to work pretty good. Pain of arthritis has been decreased from 6/10 to 3/10. Taste isn't too bad.
NEG 	I loved the first book in this new mature series but somehow Chris and Seymour ‘s story was a little flat for me. Don’t get me wrong I enjoyed it but felt something was missing and I cannot put my finger on it. Please read it for yourself I gave it 4 stars and perhaps someone somewhere can tell me what I am missing ;
NEG 	Yiu know it's a good story when you find yourself thinking about it between reads. In fact I stayed up rather late the last read just to finish the story.
NEG 	Good value for the price. Difficult to read in certain light. Easy to program.
NEG 	Nice shirt - I am usually a medium but it was too big. Requested a return and they sent me a size small for no extra money. Lovely seller interaction.
NEG 	It worked well in the door for my Toyota Sequoia. Had to do a slight adjustment to it to make it fit. But overall very happy with the product.
NEG 	Works good and moisturizes my doge skin very well
NEG 	Not the quietest of earplugs. Worked fine for small handgun and rifle calibers, but not enough for magnum handgun and rifle. However, hearing is great while wearing, which makes them perfect for hunting, or other situations where hearing protection is needed, but you would still like to hear conversational level sounds.
NEG 	The mower is excellent. I love it. It's not my first, but it's been a decade or so since I went all lawn-retro and this thing is even better than my first time...so to speak. Thing to realize about using a push-reel mower is that a) you kinda hafta have mostly bermuda grass, b) you have to have your lawn pretty much under control to begin with, and c) there's no such thing as mowing too much. Like, with a regular gas mower, you feel stupid running over stuff you mowed a couple days ago, but with a push-reel mower, that's not only a good thing, but you can probably actually see the clippings flying. Which makes you feel significantly less stupid. That being said, it's got the same problem my first one had. See, in these mowers, the cutting height is controlled by the height of the back wheels, or rollers, or whatever. Rollers, in this one. They're mounted on little plastic legs that, for reasons known only to push-reel mower designers, only have one bolt apiece to hold them on to the chassis of the mower. Basic physics will tell ya that a single bolt that isn't placed at the exact point of stress will result in sideways shear force on the plastic leg, and it does, and the manufacturer's answer is to put a little lip on the soft plastic leg, which does basically nothing after the first time you hit deep grass because the metal chassis cuts straight through the little plastic lip like that's what it was made for. The upshot is, hey, ALL these mowers have this problem. But it IS a problem. So, take my advice and invest in a couple extra 5/16 bolts, make 'em say 1 3/4 inches long, and then put a second bolt through each stupid little plastic roller leg. This will prevent it from pivoting around the first bolt, and let it deal with the sideways torque, and voila, as them French say, you will now be able to apply actual shoving force to the handle without discovering your mower suddenly defaulting to cutting at 1/2 inch when you'd set it to 2 inches. Your grass will thank you. All of that being said, I still give the sucka 4 stars. I mean, it does what it says it'll do better than gas mowers that cost twice as much. These things are awesome.
NEG 	Use this to inflate my bike tires. Works great except gauge not moving. I just fill it up tell I think its full enough with air!
NEG 	Loved everything about this brace except that it seems a little too tight on my upper arm, even though it is adjustable. It may be that I am not yet comfortable with wearing the brace and the material may actually relax a little with use. It definitely provides proper support and the material is of high quality. Yep, I'm gonna keep it!
NEG 	I've used Cetaphil for years and am happy with the product. But when I ordered this multi-pack, the face wipe package arrived dried out. The seal seems to have failed.
NEG 	Note: these carabiners are not to be used for holding weight (as in climbing)! The package contained 2 large-sized, 3 mid-sized, and 10 small-sized carabiners, plus 8 small key rings, 2 key tags, and one braided cable loop with a threaded screw closure. The larger carabiners have a locking mechanism to guard against inadvertent opening. The assortment of sizes in this package of connectors provides for many uses, such as organizing keys and providing a way to connect and "quick-release" from belts, loops, hooks, etc. The carabiners' springs are sturdy so they can be relied upon to keep your keys safe. I was happy with this purchase.
NEG 	good puzzle but we were missing one piece.
NEG 	I use this product to boost my energy, and curb my appetite around lunch time. I really like the results!
NEG 	I would've rated 5 stars, but they fit a bit smaller than expected. Maybe I have to break them in. Other than that, I love them
NEG 	Good coverage, but slides off easily.
NEG 	Amish books a always good.
NEG 	Good read. I will be interested to see how the storyline develops. I hope to see new stories but details of his personal history revealed.
NEG 	A bit weak for my taste, but the coffee is fresh and a good value
NEG 	I bought my sets individual. But you can get these with the cups and bowls. Easy to clean at the campsite and our very durable.
NEG 	Worked well for our trip to Florida. The humidity was high so they didn’t stay cool long.
NEG 	My dog loves these, but she's a bit constipated I've noticed, not sure if from this or not but I've been giving this to her for a week and thats when constipation started. Ugh i hope its good
NEG 	Bought this TV as a Christmas present since I have the 6 series 2017 version. I looked into the features and was surprised how many features where missing from last years model. Before I get into that, the picture quality and sound are fantastic. Absolutely no complaints on that. The smart hub is very easy to navigate and Samsung has by far the best smart TVs. Now for the features. It might be something small but this TV doesnt have the same amount of samsung Smart phone integration as the last year model. In the 2017 version you can use your phone as an extended speaker or if you want to listen to the TV without disturbing someone sleeping but in this one you cant. I could also watch whatever was on the TV on my phone and this was very useful if I was leaving the room and wanted to continue watching if I was in the garage, kitchen, etc. But again in this one you cant do that. The only thing yo ih can do, like any other smart TV nowadays, is stream from your phone to the TV. Every TV these days can do that so it's a shame that Samsung took that out of this version. Anyway, TV is overall great but the lack of smart phone features as compared to last years version was a slight disappointment.
NEG 	Jackson and Maya's story had my hands clenched because of all the action packed danger! I could not give it 5 Stars because it ended too abruptly for me. I wanted to witness the next day at least with them. I felt that was as taken away from us. Jackson is a PJ and Maya is Security Forces, Lieutenant. Both are Alphas in their own right. The danger and torture they go through will eat away at you as you read.
NEG 	Sounds good to me, good range of overdrive sounds. Very quiet pedal, no background hum or buzz.
NEG 	Happy with purchase - hung up my Red Hot Chili Peppers album nicely.
NEG 	I purchased these back in December about 6 months ago and they work as intended most of the time. I bought them to have my various pet tanks on a set schedule but the schedule occasionally just stops working for no apparent reason. It's only happened 2 or 3 times but it's still very annoying when it does happen.
NEG 	Seized up and not all-weather friendly
NEG 	It’s actually on photo paper, in case anyone is wanting poster Version. I love it, doesn’t take way from it at all.
NEG 	The rubber pieces eventually break off and fall off overtime but would buy again.
NEG 	Disliked that they are narrow and when wearing them they don’t feel secure like you might fall but I like the shoe itself looks like picture went with my outfit I done have anything bad to say about it I wear a 9 in USA so I always order me a nine in any heels
NEG 	Nothing really exciting
NEG 	I've tried, unsuccessfully, to make a "bujo" myself. Google, YouTube, and Pinterest aren't how I learn to do things. I'm 31, but I like having a book teach me. I'm not a fan of online learning when it comes to art projects like this. Thankfully this book exists! I read it within 3 days, and have started MY dot journal. I expect, like the book stated, I'll get better at determining my style with time and practice. I would NOT recommend this to those who can learn easily from online methods. I would recommend this for those who find learning online silly, and like to have a physical item to learn from, look back at, and hold on to.
NEG 	A surprisingly good story of love between two different types. Love between witches and warlocks, wolves and bears. Enjoyed it as a slow day in a hit summer.
NEG 	Have been watching a lot of Dr. Berg videos and recently started using this product for general detox. I have been taking these in addition to adrenal support and have seen a huge difference - much better sleep, less bloating, a sense of relaxed feeling, lesser anxiety/mood swings and overall a notch up in feeling. I believe these 2 supplements are part of Dr. Berg's daily diet which I am planning to follow soon.
NEG 	could have better hangers..
NEG 	Well made and light. Slides very well. After a month of use have had a splinter or two come from banged corners that I had to sand off
NEG 	Decoy draws doves!. I modified decoy with a staple type loop, in the back of the neck area, to be able to hoist to an overhead cable for extra visibility
NEG 	Bought this as a gift for my mom who is in a nursing home. She said her teeth never felt or looked better! Also said it worked better than the Soniccare she used to use.
NEG 	These are the next best thing to the Nespresso brand capsules.
NEG 	Nice leggings, but more like velvet than corduroy. Attracts lint and pet hair excessively.
NEG 	I thought I would get better reception with this, but what ever. It does work and it was not that bad of a price.
NEG 	Both my girlfriend & I seem to see lot better & stronger nails, they grow faster too! And our hair seem some what healthier & thicker too! We have been reordering it for the last 3 months now ! STU HS
NEG 	Simple notebook, paper quality is just ok. Good for taking disposable notes.
NEG 	These are alright. You get what you pay for and these are pretty inexpensive. They don’t look super nice but are fine to sleep on. I like that they care cotton. They are pretty small and fit my standard pillows pretty snug.
NEG 	I'm working on my BSN and my program required that we have our own BP cuff and stethoscope. Since the ratings were so high and the price was for this bundle was the same as most of the other highly rated, reasonably priced BP cuffs, I decides to go ahead and bite. I figured I might as well try to kill two birds with one stone. The cuff is amazing, I'm so pleased with the quality! In fact, all of my class mates prefer to use my cuff over theirs and the ones that are available in lab! The sound from the stethoscope is crystal clear. It is better than my littmann. The problem is that not only are the ear pieces difficult to situate in the ear, they are very painful! I would have given this set a 5 star rating if it had not been for that!
NEG 	My wife was graduating from med school and I thought it would be a good idea to pick up this lens to take pictures for her graduation ( we also hired a Photographer). The problem is, the lens are a little difficult to adjust to some phones (I use an iPhone 8 plus) and is hard to use the portrait feature of smart phones with them. So, I returned the lens. However, the lens were of solid quality, they did what they were suppose to do and it's not the companies fault that they didn't work for my situation. That is why I gave them a 4 star review.
NEG 	Age appropriate games. Just wish there was some additional explanation to the pages before we bought them and downloaded the audio. We had no idea whether they would be good for our kids until we already had them at home. Also wish there were more animations in some of the 3D books than there were
NEG 	Stones fell out it's an inconvenience please work on adhesive.
NEG 	well Worth the money
NEG 	Delivered as promised; looks like it will do the job
NEG 	Just what I ordered.
NEG 	Loaded quickly. Quick search, found what I was looking for.
NEG 	Oh I am so really to read the next book . Can't wait to find out what happens with rye and the two guys.
NEG 	I bought this tool for a Chiropractor friend in Rome. He couldn't find it in Italy. He told me that he like the tool and is very useful for his job.
NEG 	As described, received timely, works as expected.
NEG 	Product works fine . Good pic, Easy install if you have basic skills. Its pretty standard. BUT Where it separates it from the others is the company's Customer Service. Had a issue with the camera at month 11 of the 12 month warranty. The camera went on the fritz. I emailed the company and about two hours later they replied saying they were going to send me a new one. Then the next day another email stating it was on its way. Incredible. Really appreciate a company that communicates and actually cares about keeping their good reputation. Will definately do business again based on the customer service.
NEG 	I purchase the service and the card is sent to my family. They receive and use the money card on anything they desire from Amazon. It works great! ( Dion't mess it up by trying to "improve" the service, leave it alone ).
NEG 	Love my easy on, easy off men’s Crocs. I purchased a size smaller (9) than what a usually wear (10) based on reviews and the 9 fits just right. Crocs are functional footwear for around the house, beach, etc. Recommended
NEG 	Does the job, but it would make more sense for the small dongle to be the receiver so you can plug it into a projector more easily and could power it with a USB port instead of needing a wall outlet.
NEG 	Everything arrived as described, cooked some salmon and corn over some rice and came out perfect.
NEG 	Fits great I don't like that you can't put the phone with the screen facing out where you can see the display in the belt clip holsters but besides that it perfect and a awesome price
NEG 	I really like the retro styled gown . Only thing is it’s having only net/mesh over shoulder . Which doesn’t suit me so I returned this otherwise the fall of material & dosing is really beautiful .
NEG 	This is a stunning table and perfect for spring and summer patio furniture. Everything folds to store in the garage during the winter. The quality is fairly decent, especially for the price! I would not expect very large people to be comfortable in these chairs, though. The arms do not fold up and the chairs are built for small/ average weight people. Giving it 4 stars because it was a total pain in the rear to put together, and the instructions were awful (no words, and minimal photos). If you aren't good at assembling furniture then do not buy this table set.
NEG 	Great as earbuds. Noise cancelling just turns up the volume - I cannot detect any active cancellation going on, but they were refurbs, and the price was right, so...
NEG 	Perfect fit and very comfortable
NEG 	for me ok for hard worker not good
NEG 	they work, chicken lay where they are
NEG 	The plastic tip is slightly too long. I had to cut some off the end. It does come with extra tips, thank goodness.
NEG 	Beautiful shoe/boot. Stiff around ankle area. Caused discomfort while wearing for first time. Unsure if there is solution to this except to continue to wear to break in
NEG 	bought as a gift my co worker love it
NEG 	Once is full charged the battery doesn’t last very long. Other than that is useful.
NEG 	Works great! Good for scaring people
NEG 	Wonderful product with strip at the bottom to attach to the back seat! Much stable with a lot of load!
NEG 	The tip breaks down after a while so that kind of sucked other than that it was pretty good
NEG 	We have one cat who loves it. I had to thow a couple towels in there before they would stay inside. I'm not sure if it was the extra cushion or making it smell like us, but it worked. It could definitely use a little more cushion inside. One of our 2 cats spends a lot of time inside just looking out, surveying the living room. They won't use the top pillow though. At least not that we have seen. And it is strong enough to support our big boy who is 14lbs no problem.
NEG 	Unique storyline . A good tale with characters you like and that all important HEA. Wondering what happened to that email to Clay, though.
NEG 	Fast delivery and good quality part
NEG 	I would have given this review 5 stars if the plates had come with a name template card inserts. They are lightweight, and stick to glass, drywall and cubical fabric with double sided sticky tape.
NEG 	It's a very good cell for the price. Do not like that it cannot be unlocked until a year with total wireless passes.
NEG 	Overall what was expected.
NEG 	Spring mechanism gave out quicker than I would have liked but it’s a fairly durable one for the cost
NEG 	Used a 128gb model of this in my phone for the past year, bought a 64gb to go in my phone and moved the 128gb to my Nintendo Switch. Fantastic read/write speeds for the price. Switch games load quickly and no wait times when taking RAW pictures and recording 4k on my phone. My only gripe is the USB reader. It's very small, durable, good build quality, and great read/write speeds. However, getting the microSD out of the reader is a bit of a pain. Once fully inserted barely any of the microSD sticks out so it's a bit difficult to remove. Other than that, caught the 64gb microSD and reader on sale for $29 so it's a great deal.
NEG 	This Harry Potter Hedwig Wing scarf is very nice. It's an officially licensed product that has a nice wingspan and features Hedwig with a letter in his beak. My daughter loves Harry Potter and especially Hedwig, so when I saw this scarf I had to get it for her. Please note that this is a very light scarf. It won't protect you from any severely cold weather, but it's perfect for early fall evenings and during the day when the sun is out. I highly recommend this lovely scarf.
NEG 	Good toaster. Serves its purpose and fits bagels which is a plus
NEG 	Have no idea why the book has title "Dig Two Graves". Never read anything digging it graves. Good ending. A lot still left to solve.
NEG 	The top being exposed to the air makes it so that if you aren't paying attention dust and debris can get on it. Bottle sweats. Keeps things cool for like 1 hour longer than bottles without a layer of foil. Inside of bottle has dimples that make it way harder to clean.
NEG 	The quality is good. No dislikes
NEG 	4 stars because some of the used books were in worse condition than expected.
NEG 	I love these! They are so much more pigmented than Sharpie brand, and I have less bleeding issues with these being used to sign photos than I do with sharpie brand. Only downside is that they do not dry immediately on all surfaces and some.surfaces require a little wait time.
NEG 	Looks like the picture and works great !
NEG 	They work well. Wish they were softer though
NEG 	Very nice product. Saw pictures of people that had dents in there product and thought it was just maybe a few and it happens. But was bummed out mine came out like that when I unwrapped. And a dent in the front. I wouldn’t have a problem if it wasn’t in the front. Also one of the top. Other than that it’s awesome for price and what it looks like. Would like company to contact me.
NEG 	Using to clean my dogs ear, tried other products and this one works great.
NEG 	Great cups, I wanted a cup with straw for my almost 2yo that loves drinking out of straws. Wanted them attached so he could not pull straw out/off cup. Product is exactly what is shown on boxed photo. Would be great if they would offer the other colors shown.
NEG 	The front protector was missing 😕 and that is the specific reason I chose this case...
NEG 	Definitely has its moments. Stay with the film until you see the fascinating 5th Century Village. This is a beautiful documentary with a few faults and I'm sure each viewer will find their own but you might give it a try...for the scenery alone.
NEG 	They just didn't fit my granddaughter right
NEG 	convenient for the minis...but quite a bit flimsy...but then again...it is silicone
NEG 	We’ve had the item installed on the phone for over a week. So far, so good. This was the first device I ever did an installation on. I watched several How-To videos before attempting to install. Was super proud of myself when done. I found all the items included in the kit useful. Especially the Guide Stickers and the Dust-absorber sticker. The method using the Guide Stickers I employed on other family devices too, as I found it very useful. Plus the other screen protectors I ordered did not have the Guide Stickers, so these have come in very handy. I guess time will tell how durable the item is. But I’m happy with the product so far.
NEG 	A nice, heavy duty hat. Perfect for the winter. Only complaint is that the material makes my forehead itchy at times.
NEG 	Great for what i needed only complain is metal hook is a little small for my closet rod.
NEG 	Cute but flimsy.... there isn’t enough of a lip if you have a glass protector on your phone. Be prepared to have you glass scratched to bits. I gave mine away because I don’t want my expensive iPhone damaged Their customer service department is excellent and have handeled the whole situation in a very timely fashion and sent me a refund
NEG 	I always wear liners in my sandals but the right ones can be hard to find. I was excited to try these. They are well made, no seams. The pack comes with a pair of tan and a pair of black. They are about 3 1/2 inches wide and 3 inches long out of the package. Very stretchy. They are a little looser on my foot and a bit longer than I would like. I actually had to fold them over to keep them hidden. Not a bad product though.
NEG 	Excellent! It's nice to have the variety and availability
NEG 	My only small issue with this item is that you have to glue all the pieces together or else the centerpiece will not stay put together.
NEG 	Only giving 4 stars because I thought it was a little bigger. I put two small (10 1/2 oz )soup cans on top if each other so you can get an idea of the height. Very stylish and not bad for the price. The hardware isn't that durable but over all cute purse.
NEG 	Very sturdy. Comfortable for what it is (but they aren't made to be comfortable. The velcro belt keepers (supplied with belt) suck, recommend a platinum belt keeper for the outer belt and the velcro as extra security to bind the outer to inner belt. After a few accessories were slid on it has begun to fray in a few spots, recommend against moving gear around on it excessively.
NEG 	Interesting read - unexpected ending
NEG 	Does exactly what it's supposed to, clean the smell of previous owners out of the car.
NEG 	good bed time read.
NEG 	So far, so good. It takes a while to find the perfect center of gravity for a perfect balance but it’s perfect for a cell phone. I need more practice to see if a dale can handle the weight.
NEG 	Oliver has enjoyed a successful career as a model but at 27 he is finding that he is an old man in a young man’s business and that is how Book Boyfriend Inc. came to be. He is an escort who will be the perfect book boyfriend for his clients and make all their fantasies come true or at least that was the plan until he can’t forget one of his dates, Bailey. Bailey is married to William, an unfaithful politician, and she must keep up the pretense that they are happily married. When she learns about Book Boyfriends Inc., she believes it is the perfect answer for the lonely life she is leading. Oliver and Bailey become close but things become complicated not only by the death of Bailey’s husband but by Oliver having to choose between loyalty to his best friend and roommate Skye and his new love Bailey. Let the scandal begin! I enjoyed this debut story from this author and I would definitely read her future books.
NEG 	Bigger than I expected. I have carried 3 different rabbits in it, probably 5 different times and the Velcro is already losing it's firm hold. Despite the lack of firm grip of Velcro it's worked quite well!
NEG 	the screen protector that comes with the case leaves a lot of bubbles so I ended up removing it but besides that it's a great case
NEG 	They are beautiful. The only problem is that I pay 3 times more than their price to blow them.
NEG 	It arrived to big so i sent it back
NEG 	Surprisingly comfy heels (although, because I don't wear heels often, I took them off pretty quickly)- but they don't hurt. I just like flat shoes. The glitter actually stayed on the shoes and not on me. I only didn't like the glue that was showing all over it, but you can't see it when I have them on, so that's ok.
NEG 	When talk on the phone the other person on the line can not hear you but hear everything else in your background.
NEG 	I liked the size of these rings and how much extra I can put in them. My only issue is that paper does not slide on these the way they do the plastic ones. It’s a bit of a struggle to get the papers to move on them and I always feel like I’m going to rip the paper.
NEG 	Sandals are comfortable, light and look great. Ankle strap is a little too long. I normally wear size 7 but bought a size 6.5.
NEG 	Love this wallet. The color is very pretty and I love the layout of the card holders inside and the fact that it holds a lot of them. I'm not a fan of the covering on the I.D slot, but other than that it's really nice.
NEG 	We purchased for my daughter's 3rd birthday party. Kids loved it - easy to assemble & deflate. Only issue is the markings on the side (see pictures) - the main logo is upside down. At least the instructions are right-side-up!
NEG 	4 starts for overall good quality. I wish they would block more noise.
NEG 	At first I thought I would be getting myself an averaged hand-sized fan that gusts enough wind to kind of keep me cool in the summer heat. Instead, this product arrived in a very long box and I was surprised to see that the fan itself was very durable with the fan-material being some sort of durable paper (similar to card stock). The fan spanned about 8-9 inches and was much more than what I expected. Also, it was wooden, contrary to my belief of it being metallic. I suppose at the time that I wasn’t too big of a fan. However, now using this product for myself, I realize that it gusts a lot of air in small motions which makes for a fantastic manual fan. Indeed, this product does its job and is better than my mini-USB fan (if you take away the fact that I’m physically fanning myself) Although, this product may be a little too big to bring out in public, and I dropped it once which lead to a scratch on the tip of the wooden bottom (as expected). This is why I rate the product 4.2 stars, and if anything is to change by the time I submit this review then I shall go back and adjust it accordingly!
NEG 	This table is awesome!!!! So cheap, but very sturdy and beautiful. However, you do need a screwdriver to completely put it together and that isn’t in any of the information when you buy it.
NEG 	Love not having a cord to run over. Very powerful suction. Only wish the HEPA filter dried faster after rinsing. Still early to completely evaluate..
NEG 	The outside of the box was very scuffed up and crushed when it delivered so I was worried after reading some reviews, but the inside was packed well and no damage to the unit. It assembled easily enough, only one side didn't match up perfectly but the mattress covered it up so not a big deal. I added felt tabs on all the bottoms to make it easy to change the sheets. My 11 year old is happy with it and it does look nice.
NEG 	Easy set up and placement, and if facing in the right direction and high enough up you get an incredibly good picture with a wide range of channels in the NYC area.
NEG 	The product arrived on time, packed well, and matched the product description. I actually love having this little fan on my desk. My one complaint is it will occasionally make a clicking sound and requires me to shake it to stop the sound. Almost a perfect product.
NEG 	Its great just wish it came in more colors
NEG 	Smaller than I expected but it works and its cute.
NEG 	Although it's a shame that it won't lock the Joy Cons in place, still a good product to go for.
NEG 	These feel a little flimsy and don't really lock down on a light stand, but for the price you really can't complain.
NEG 	Needed it and any thing to reduced prep time in the kitchen.
NEG 	Love love love. Good quality, I’ve had better but I got this on sale and can’t complain the scent is fresh and light plus it’s going to last.
NEG 	I saw these at Sam's club , they are cheaper on here !
NEG 	I'm a recreational user and for that use this scope is pretty good. Have taken it to my local park a couple of times and had fun learning how to use it. The phone mount is a bit fiddly but usable. Focusing at high zoom seems hit or miss. I’m guessing that it’s some combination of my old eyes and the phone camera trying to focus on the object image at the eyepiece. Need more time to sort that out. Probably could have spent a lot more $ but for me that was unnecessary. Excuse the focus in some of my images as it was my first time out using the scope and phone mount.
NEG 	Very good book didn’t like the end where you have to wonder until you get the next book. Not patient. I love the story line and the characters
NEG 	Only problem I have is that if your watching a a video on the headset the sound is a little delayed
NEG 	Works, but something about it is smaller than my otoscope. We fixed this problem by folding a small piece of aluminum foil for the base. Now it works perfectly.
NEG 	Fair case for a fair price. Not the sturdiest but well built and reliable. Perfect for housing my podcast mic, cords, whiskey bottle and 4 shot.glasses all set for travel.
NEG 	I had a size 8.5 witch was fitting too big and I bought this pair witch feel kinda small around the toe
NEG 	These are great speaker mounts. I recommend these even in the face of the following [somewhat questionable] complaints: They were very easy for me to put together, but I have a great concept of three-dimensional manipulation and am quite dexterous. There are a lot of things you have to hold in place with your fingers before being able to bolt it all together. They're heavy for their size and an odd shape, which may make assembly annoying for some. The plastic plates which cover the mounting bracket aren't affixed to the frame in any way. Bass frequencies cause these to slide along the frame, and thus off the wall, very frequently. Even when just listening to spoken word. I'm sure some sticky tack will fix this, but I have none on hand. The second picture in this review highlights this issue. There are holes in the frame through which one can run speaker wire. This is a great feature, but unfortunately while these holes are large enough for speaker wire, they are too small for speaker cables and power cables. I am using powered speakers, so these holes serve me no purpose. The acorn nuts protruding from the base of the mounts lend an industrial aesthetic; which is not in my favor, but only a concern now that I am inspecting the items for this review. They're not horrendous, just make sure you don't scratch the black paint off of them. I wish they had a higher range of motion. In the first picture for this review, they are tilted down as far as they go. Due to the size of my monitor, and wall studs being 16" on-center, this was the only place I could install them. They are aimed slightly above my head; which is not ideal for music production, but works perfectly fine. All in all, this is a great product. Even though there are certainly better options out there, I would recommend these to anyone simply for the price and build quality.
NEG 	Nice quality for your money.
NEG 	This is a nice thin, strong, metal football holder that is perfect for displaying collectors footballs. It was easy to install as well.
NEG 	Love the bag... pockets are much bigger than they look! My 8month old GSD weighs about 50 lbs right now and he bag is a bit too big for her. My only complaint (and reason for 4 stars) is that the straps do not stay tight. If we go for a walk or run the straps end up loosening and then the bag starts sliding off her. I am hoping when she fills out a bit more we won’t have a problem with having to have the straps so tight.
NEG 	a bit larger than expected. top lid is rubber and is a bit of an awkward fit. loved it for a place for lots of water colors!
NEG 	works with my garage opener.
NEG 	Works great. I used it on some headphones.
NEG 	The table was delivered with a small chip on the edge of the table. I needed the table for a function so didnt have time to send it back but still happy with the it overall.
NEG 	They were a little thick and kept my bathroom door from closing. But I decided to put them on a closet door and it works fine.
NEG 	This a great idea. The feel and touch of this is really nice....super premium. I love this in my truck. My only complaint is that it adds a layer of fabric to the feet of the lid, so closing the lid is now a tighter latch connection....almost too tight.
NEG 	It was very easy to use
NEG 	Easy to use. 3 brushes to choose from is nice. Charger works great. My only reservation is that the brush only holds a charge for about 3 uses. Not a problem, just put it on the charger for a little while after using.
NEG 	I always fall forward when trying to sleep on an airplane. This product is effective of preventing me falling. Still not necessary the most comfortable position to fall asleep, but in combination with a neck brace, works fairly well.
NEG 	Felt like I was discovering everything with our heroine. Lovely story
NEG 	I reordered this recently, and had not taken it for a couple weeks, and my hip hurt a lot more the last few days. So I am starting the pills again, will report in a few weeks, while this time I will take them every day! But so far so good!
NEG 	My kids had seen this elsewhere (9 & 12) and insisted we watch again. Was a cute movie. Fairly predictable in terms of humor/etc when you consider the cast, but enjoyable overall.
NEG 	Quiet and ideal for a bedroom. Not great for long durations of full darkness. Nicely visible if there is some minimal ambient light and early in the night.
NEG 	Item came bent in the package. Cover had visible indentations along the width of the book.
NEG 	Pretty good for the money. It is cheaper than renting one for a few hrs or day. Gets the job done.
NEG 	Not as sturdy as it should be for a device that cleans carpets, but if you hold the handle gently it works great.
NEG 	Very cute and good material!! Top was a bit small... I’m bigger on the top so it’s hard to move a lot without exposing myself but it’s super cute so I make it work!
NEG 	I had to watch this film for a class I was taking in which we watched a film about disturbing, lurid, and/or violent content every week and then wrote our critique of it. It's extremely unsettling and disgusting. I had a very hard time sitting through it, and I was angry through most of it. It's not a film you watch for entertainment unless you're some kind of sicko. However, it is a very well-made film. The ending didn't really feel like an ending, but I was glad that it didn't entirely miss the point of the novel and try to make it into a romance (because that's disgusting). I give credit where credit is due, but I definitely would never willingly sit through this film again.
NEG 	I like the case but it won't work with my wireless charger.
NEG 	This is my 4th Kindle. Before I bought the Voyage, I borrowed the Oasis, Voyage, and Paperwhite from my local library. I kept renewing the Voyage for 4 months before I bought it. Pros: Lightweight, lighting is not overpowering, advance pages using light-touch buttons or touch screen swipe, power button is on the back (not the bottom), and adding books from email links is simple. Cons: It’s pretty pricey as compared to the Paperwhite and occasionally I hold the button too long or too hard and the Voyage goes forward two pages rather than one.
NEG 	The shocks work great. All i do is press the button to open the glass window and the shocks do the rest. The window opens by itself. The shocks were easy to install and appear to be very strong. I would recommend them.
NEG 	Right price. Sizing little large. If you wear XL get large. Love breathability.
NEG 	These work great but they are not white. Really would like to see them correct this color choice. They are beige or almond. I have four of these and I need white so I have to order another brand! Really wish they would make these in true white.
NEG 	smells great and my heels are smoother
NEG 	Very nice case. Would give 5 stars if it covered the front.
NEG 	So far so good. Seems to be good quality
NEG 	Exactly what I was looking for. I use one for olive oil and one for canola oil. Very pleased.
NEG 	Good product. As expected.
NEG 	Loved this book. You can always count on hilary to give ya a hot read with amazing characters. Always wanting more
NEG 	Durable cord and great bulbs. Very appealing appearance.
NEG 	So far so good! These have been a great replacement battery for my Dewalt drill. Much better than paying almost $100 per battery for the name brand. I use these on an almost daily basis and it's been great.
NEG 	When I received my monitor it was not working. Finally a friend told me to change the battery and it worked. They sent it to me with a dead battery!!
NEG 	Just received this necklace which I had purchased for my 4 year-old granddaughter's birthday. I had looked at this design for awhile before deciding on this one from this company. It is absolutely beautiful and I know she will love it. All that said I was extremely disappointed in the packaging/shipping. It was in a tiny plastic bag which was dropped randomly into a shipping box with several larger and heavier items. A comparable necklace appears to have been presented in a small box suitable for gifting. I guess I chose the wrong one (and it was a few cents less).
NEG 	Some of the balloons had holes in them so I would recommend ordering extra.
NEG 	About an inch shorter than I'm used to my boxers, but decently quality and they look good. I suppose shorter ain't bad...easier access eh? It was kind annoying but I had black link all over my goods till after about two washes (of the boxers and my goods). You have that to look forward to.
NEG 	Once you figure out how to install these (there are some user made instructions in the Amazon reviews for this item - use them!, they work pretty well. The instructions that come with the set are terribly translated. I would suggest assuming that these hinges will hold about 60% of the weight they state in the product description. They are working for now, but I believe they will wear out fairly quickly with prolonged use, if you go anywhere near their maximum product load.
NEG 	Haven't had a chance to use it much but it seems to be a reliable product.
NEG 	Great quality. Don’t stretch out over time. Worn all 3 and get compliments every time. I am 5’2” about 160lbs and found they fit well.
NEG 	Color is off from picture other than that great
NEG 	Chair looks good, comes pretty well assembled, seems to be decent. There is no real head support, I am 6'3" and the back of the chair stops below my shoulders. The foot rest doesn't go up very high but it goes up enough and I can lay the chair back completely when reclined. The chair will spin even when reclined which I wanted. Overall I'm satisfied with the purchase, I would imagine I'll get a few years use out of it. I probably would not buy this model again as a bigger guy but overall it seems acceptable.
NEG 	I bought this mainly because it holds Large amount of water. Goal is to drink a whole bottle each day. The cap shuts tightly and easy to drink water out of. I have no problem using it. However when I hold the water bottle upside down water does leak and drip out. It does not bother me because I never hold it upside down. Does not leak when drinking.
NEG 	They are really nice but u had issues getting the zipper to zip up. Frustrating if your down under a desk or something and trying to keep cables together and zip them in
NEG 	Very happy with purchase. Only complaint is the colors are not very Brite. Otherwise, these placemats look good. Seems well made.
NEG 	A little bit big if your child is thin.I had to get it alterations to fit him for a wedding.
NEG 	The last two bags I've purchased have come without the scoop even though it states there is one. Can you send me a scoop? Also, why has the cost increased so much?
NEG 	LOVELY FRAGRANCE BUT TOO EXPENSIVE
NEG 	Disliked that it burned when in contact with mucous membrane, use for adhesion not lube.
NEG 	Hard to find color here. A wonderful product and good service in its purchase.
NEG 	A good product for the price. Some of the perforations could be stamped a little better for easier separating of the 12”x12” sheets. For the low price I can deal with this small issue.
NEG 	My Daughter loves the book..Now getting her boyfriend to read it...
NEG 	The book had a good storyline and exciting Characters. I would enjoy reading the entire series. Excellent story settings and destinations.
NEG 	Works well but hard to fit in a shoe.
NEG 	I thought it would be smaller, but I have more stuff to put into it than I thought. It's a nice weight and carries a lot more than you would.
NEG 	I've used this twice, with no visible difference so far. First time was after a shower but I didn't exfoliate my feet in the shower. Second time, today, I did exfoliate and used this right out of the shower so I'm hoping to see a significant softness to my feet. I will edit this in coming days with more information as it becomes visible and available. My rating will change after that point.
NEG 	I will have to let you know when our grandaughter opens it at Christmas. It was one thing on her list.
NEG 	I think the sofa is great value for the price. I can't figure out whether its bonded or "real" leather but it looks nice. It does mark easy though but I think that adds to the character of the furniture so it doesn't bother me. The seat cushions are held on by velcro and they do stay. The sear cushions start to relax after being used for a while (started off quite hard) but you'll need some cushions for your back unless you like sitting bolt upright. I liked this sofa so much that I went and bought two of the armchairs as well!
NEG 	lens cover was cracked on camera.
NEG 	Good quality, good price
NEG 	Only 3 of the 5 worked when I received them, however the company was quick to send 5 more to resolve this issue. Overall, I am happy with this purchase.
NEG 	I bought these for my husband. He likes them a lot and they work well. Keeps his beer nice and cold!
NEG 	The girls had a blast with the tattoos. Easy to use for age appropriate kids.
NEG 	Good game with mini games and tasks to complete
NEG 	Works great for calming
NEG 	There is not as much curvature to the spoon and fork as I would like. They are really shallow. I do not recommend using the knife to cut tough meat, but it works ok for softer foods. I keep these in my office to use when eating lunch instead of disposable utensils.
NEG 	I bought this for the garden. I would have given the bag 5 stars but its a little small. Bag is well made.
NEG 	Nice backpack for exercise
NEG 	This thing is awesome. I drive a lot for work and use my tablet as GPS. It has been in multiple vehicles, been used on extremely cold days, extremely hot days, and has not fallen off once. Still working even after months of use, but has started to loosen from the suction cup so it moves side to side a bit now.
NEG 	As advertised. Mine is clearly issued and used, but still plenty useable, which i expected. These are not new, so if you want it new, look elsewhere.
NEG 	If do you want to Increase Retention and Be More Productive with Beginners and Advanced Techniques then must read this book.An excellent guide on photographic memory.Author really did a great job by writing this book.Still reading and want to read this again and again.
NEG 	I having try them yet but pretty sure they fit.
NEG 	Good item but I do not really use it. Not needed at all.
NEG 	This little lamp works wonderful! Its battery operated and its very bright... oh and it’s censored
NEG 	Originally my sprayers were defective, but the seller immediately reached out and replaced with new ones. I love the sprayer, and that it's not just a single spray. I bought the amber color set for my essential oils. My only complaint is that they are fragile. I accidentally dropped one of the large bottles the first day & it shattered.
NEG 	Very cute and great grip but large. Best fit for size 9 or higher, I’d imagine.
NEG 	This water hose would get 5 stars if the 2 attachments they send would work with the submersible pump I ordered. This hose was recommended. The 2 plastic threaded connectors do not fit the pump. Only connection that does work is the one that is already on the pump when you order it, which is the water hose connection. You need a threaded collar in order to use the others.
NEG 	The nickel finish is very nice and it holds the extra towel well. You will need a solid door or a wall joist to support the weight imo
NEG 	Great continuation of the Logan family story! New characters to get attached to. Looking forward to the next one!
NEG 	Not very cold. Ice works better. I guess 5 minutes of cool is better than nothing (if you have no true Ice pack)
NEG 	Fits my Blaze frame perfectly. Is a handsome color and style, but even the large size feels a bit small compared to the original band. That said, it still fits well with some room for adjustment in either direction.
NEG 	Great characters and action. Events plausible and heartwarming. The story moved along. I finished the book in a few hours
NEG 	My favorite. Great for travelling.
NEG 	Super cute, the white seems a little see through as we could see what the wearer had on under it. Other than that they loved it
NEG 	Received a day earlier than promised, and have already used it for beets and corn. The first try didn't work as the steam float valve wasn't set properly. There is a tiny solid cover that was partially covering it, but after I washed the lid and seal, it opened up. If I wasn't already experienced in using a pressure pot though, I would have been frustrated with the directions. Wish such a small pot, I find the steamer tray a bit on the high side so will probably use something different. But I love the stainless steel pot and easy to read face. I did two ears of corn by cutting them in half and trimming to sit in the pot upright, with 1 cup of water for steam and 4 minutes cook time. Did Quick Release after a couple of minutes to let things settle. Since it is a companion pressure pot to a larger one, it fills the bill for me.
NEG 	The screen protector works great! It can be a little difficult to install, but if done correctly, it works great! Air bubbles go away after a day or two if any are left. Just make sure to follow the instructions. They act as good protection for your device!
NEG 	Great protection. Hard to assemble but worth it.
NEG 	Cute but cane dirty and that’s gross
NEG 	Well written. Very few editing errors. Nice twist. But a little too much over the top treasure find. I also didn't appreciate the plugs for the author's other books in the middle of the story line.
NEG 	Great hand feel on the case. Only complaint is there is no "lip" over the front screen that would protect the screen like most other cases have. Had to add an additional screen protector to keep the screen from getting all scratched up.
NEG 	I am pleased with this floor fan. Especially like that it blows out cool air, rather than just circulating hot air around. The assembly was easy once I realized I had to remove screws, then rescrew parts to hold together. Also the remote to the fan was very difficult for me to open so I could insert battery (which was included). My neighbor was familiar with the type of remote and showed me the trick to opening. I love thar the fan is quieter than other less exspensive fans and that I am able to adjust the strength of the air flow. I get hot at night, and with selecting a lower setting, I can get a cool, quiet, breeze effect. I would give 5 stars but the instructions for assembly could have been clearer. I've never paid this much for a fan but I am pleased and would purchase again.
NEG 	A bit tight at the waist for the size I got, but otherwise perfect.
NEG 	Is very comfortable. Small but good
NEG 	This is a nice set. Bought it to organize my desk stuff (duh). The only thing I'm not crazy about is the size of the holder for the post-its. It's a bit larger than the actual notes. Otherwise, it serves it's purpose.
NEG 	My wife had sensitive teeth, so these worked great for her. Nice minty taste that isn't too overpowering.
NEG 	Super cute, lightweight, soft and comfy! Perfect size for my 11 year old niece. This was a Christmas gift. It did take a while to arrive. Would purchase again.
NEG 	For $55 bucks cant really complain that much . But If I had to : 1)The bracelet was impossible for me to size because the pins wouldnt push through ( i even broke 2 of my tools !) . And 2 , Accuracy is - 10 seconds per day . Ive had worse but I will always prefer my watches to run slightly fast. Still cant go wrong for a 50 dollar automatic watch
NEG 	This screen is pretty much what we expected. It is very light which makes it easy to move around, especially since it's so large. The set-up, however, was a bit challenging. It requires you to snap the screen into place on the frame, but it took us two strong people to pull it tight enough to fit to the snaps. We eventually got it, but are worried about how long it would take to put it back up. If you are purchasing for an event, make sure you leave enough time allotted to assemble the screen. Otherwise, just as expected.
NEG 	I am currently using this phone case. It's really pretty. But its thin. The back has shown some wear already. It's also very slick.
NEG 	Was very pleased with the weight of the utensils. The fork was used this afternoon and it worked to reduce the shaking.
NEG 	The top sheet was much too large for a queen sheet. Had to cut 12” off one side. There is a tremendous amount of lint in the dryer filter even after 3 washes. They do feel good, though.
NEG 	as far as In know they fit. and wear well
NEG 	fast service have not let dog try yet
NEG 	Loses one star because you need to turn the whole machine over and tap on it a lot to get spices out. Otherwise a great product.
NEG 	Display is great and all readings are accurate. My only issue is that the frost alarm goes off even though we don't have it set...we live in Minnesota...so it goes off too much. We had to bring the outdoor sensor in for the winter... frustrating.
NEG 	Used this lens for many many years and it's a really good lens for everyday and even for travel when you don't want to take many lenses with you.
NEG 	Bought this when my original clip busted. Only difference is this clip does not swivel.
NEG 	A bit large for a size 8. But it shines so nice!! Looks great. It’s a tad brighter and lighter than my real diamonds but perhaps with wear it’ll settle in. Looks great with my real diamonds! Love it.
NEG 	These work great, will order more. Saves money on buying a bigger bra.
NEG 	These headphones are cheap. Which is the best part about them! Ive had the same pair for 8 months and they still work flawlessly. The sound quality is the best bang for your buck. The only issue is it might speak Chinese and the buttons are kinda cheep. But these are great for school, work, and the gym.
NEG 	Love it. Want to order again.
NEG 	I ended up returning. The high setting didn't work as high. More like low. Easy return. It looks soft but too bad it doesn't work properly.
NEG 	I really like having these keto magnets. I have tried several times to follow the keto diet but it has been so hard for me to figure out what I should stock up on. With these I can make a list of foods to have in the house so I don't cheat. They are made of a very strong material allowing them to stick to my fridge and not fall off. I would have liked a few more food items listed instead of the spices and condiments.
NEG 	A little hard to get the hang of with the straps, but still super cute. The fabric is a bit thin, but I still really like the print and will be keeping it. Fit perfect as well.
NEG 	Recommend to mystery buffs. The action was good but wanted Megan to go away she was a total clueless idiot in the story
NEG 	Great quality, design, thickness, and weight, this four stars. One star lost because it isn’t the easiest to take off or put on. It gets easier over time but lining up the wholes with one hand is a pain, at first I would just clasp it then slide the watch connection in, but I got used to it and don’t have a big issue anymore. Overall, it is a good product.
NEG 	I give this product a 4 star because there were no instructions provided in the box. My 18 year old son was initially perplexed because he had never dealt with one of these before. The product is sturdy and fits great. You can't beat the price with a stick. Side Note: This bi-pod could work on many different caliber guns.
NEG 	I've only had these for a couple days, but they've been good so far and the price was right. The lights are bright and the colors vibrant. I clip one to me and one to my black lab when walking at dusk/night. Unfortunately, the yellow one arrived and doesn't work.
NEG 	I enjoyed reading this book. It was just pretty predictable
NEG 	On time, good Fit Good Shoe
NEG 	Unfortunately I didn’t receive the yellow pot and bears. I received two green pots/bears and no yellow in the box and I didn’t realize it until I opened the other pots so I can’t return it. A little upset about it. I’m just glad I bought this for my own use and didn’t give it a gift for someone..other than that the product is nice.
NEG 	I actually bought this by mistake since I have the B&D Matrix Drill/Driver. I could have just bought the impact attachment. But I decided to keep this since I got it at a great price (increased by almost $25 right after I bought it) and since some reviewers have stated that it works better than the attachment. I have a more powerful, expensive impact driver but I don't like taking that on smaller jobs such as putting something together at a craft fair. So I take this one instead. It does the job and seems to have ample power, even for the bigger jobs. Four things where I think this tool might not stack up to my more powerful, more expensive impact driver. My other driver has a bright LED light, battery level indicator, auto loading quick release, and a bigger, but light Lithium battery. Still this is a great tool and I'm glad I kept it!
NEG 	Good value for the price. The glove doesn’t exactly look like the picture but it has enough sequins that you know it’s a MJ glove.
NEG 	Good book. Story moved along pretty well. Ready for the next book in this story. A b c d e
NEG 	I bought these for our vacation in florida. We were going to spend a lot of time at water parks and the beach. I like how light weight they are and how they roll up to save space.
NEG 	Is great for clipping on to things. Mine came fully assembled. Only problem was my camera didnt like to stay on (granted it was upside down) so I hot glued the front down and that fixed it from coming unstuck at the front. The pieces of tape that come with it are not very sticky.
NEG 	These lamps are the perfect size for a small corner. I placed them on either side of my dresser. They are bright even without turning them on. I have yet to get the bulbs for them. Can't wait to see how they light up my antique bureau. Very please with them.
NEG 	Have you seen the price of regular old flowerpots lately?!? This is a set of 3 cute little pots, ceramic but not too heavy, saucers are attached, check the measurements and you won't be disappointed that they are bigger or smaller than you expected. My set came with the largest pot defective: the saucer was sealed to the pot rather off-center. Amazon shipped a replacement (thank you Amazon) and hopefully it won't be a repeat issue.
NEG 	I was impressed that I could purchase this in a large qty and have it delivered to me so quickly. Already made several batches of bath bombs and they fizz perfectly. I was surprised however when the bucket arrived not in a box. No cracks and the seal wasn't broken. Thank goodness.
NEG 	Awesome product and I will order again. Works great and the braided cable seems to hold up better than the one that came with my phone. This stuff is STRONG and you can't beat the price. Excellent product and excellent delivery service. Work as advertised!
NEG 	We love the light chocolate flavor with a dash of salt on the peanuts. The little can is great for travel when you need a protein pick-me-up, that tastes like dessert. They taste best when eaten at one sitting or within a couple days.
NEG 	This is a lovely, fragrance free oil which leaves your skin very soft. However, when the order arrived it was missing a pump and a top that opens and closes. There was no way I could use it without running the risk of spilling a ton of oil since it only had a screw on top. Amazon refunded me the purchase and I re-ordered the oil. The next order came with the necessary pump and top that will open and close. Perhaps more attention to shipping is needed. That's why I gave it four rather than five stars.
NEG 	One of the best kitchen talk bags on the market. Very sturdy and many have pleasant scents. Used to use Glad, but tried Hefty and haven't gone back.
NEG 	It’s a nice piece but it does say 2-6 years. It’s definitely too big for a toddler. My daughter just turned 5 this fits large on her. Good for 5-8 year olds.
NEG 	Clothes for American Girl dolls perfectly. Enough for two dolls to have a couple outfits with panties
NEG 	Its awesome for fidgeters like me. It does relieve some anxiety when using it. Only 4 stars because i was expecting some instruction manual inside it but no, i had to discover how to use it by myself but then again its fairy simple, its sturdy and worth the price.
NEG 	This Item Came A Little Different From The Picture But Was Still Very Cute. The Colors Were The Same. I Love It!!!
NEG 	My son really likes this night light. It is a cool gift to get someone. It comes with a charging cord that can plug into a computer, but not into the wall outlet. You would need use your own cube if you wanted to plug it into the outlet.
NEG 	Product as advertised
NEG 	Nice quality outfit. XL is really what a XXL or XXXL would be.
NEG 	I haven't washed them yet, but so far these bras fit well and provide comfortable support. I also haven't done anything strenuous, so I can't rate them for performance. Maybe one day I'll get back to the gym and they can show me what they can really do.
NEG 	Toddy filter replacements seem to work fine. You can tell they were not quite as dense as the original however the price just can’t be beat. If I owned a coffee house I might go a step above but for my home they are an economical choice.
NEG 	This was a gift for family member. Attractive blue color, easy to read. Recipient uses it daily and has had no problems.
NEG 	Looks good. Not very bulky. Seems to resist dirt better than previous cases I have tried. It’s kind of bland and boring but it certainly gets the job done. I have dropped my phone several times to no ill effect.
NEG 	Great for making roll cakes
NEG 	Not sure why Amazon asks for noise cancelation rating bc I don't think that's the point of these curtains. They're pretty well made and block out light very well. However, I was hoping for a little better heat blocking.
NEG 	I would have liked the outside of the case to be just a little stiffer and the inside a little heavier duty. I do like it though and everything fits perfectly
NEG 	I got the splitter and extended cord so I could use my Xbox head set and mic on my com. Was nice that I got a 10% discount when I purchased them at the same time. They can be a little hard to get them to connect the first time but they have not slipped out
NEG 	Packaging was great, nothing spilled out. I’m pretty impressed with this product! Have used many more expensive brands & this one is actually better! Only gave 4 stars bc it can “ ball up” on your skin after a while if you don’t rub it in enough. Otherwise it’s great!
NEG 	Gave one star. Only one pen works. Waiting to see if issue resolved. Update: Few days later received email saying would refund half of money.
NEG 	Really great shoe - well made for the inexpensive price! Pleasantly surprised! Not sure about how they wear over time since I had to return then due to too small fit. The bottom sole has a nice non-slip silicone sewn into it and the toe box is perfectly wide for chubby toddler feet. Unfortunately I gave it one less star because the size runs a bit smaller than any of the other 12-18 size shoes and sandals I’ve purchased. My 1 year old fits 4-4.5 and his toes just about touched the front of the shoe.
NEG 	I feel like the story was only an opener. I could have stayed with all the characters longer! Thanks!
NEG 	Great quality,handles make it easy to move,exactly as described.
NEG 	I was looking for something that would work for me....I am a heavy sleeper and traditional alarms don’t wake me in the morning. I appreciate that I can choose 4 different sounds to accompany the light alarm in the morning. I get the functions of the three buttons on top mixed up at times but that’s me.... my grandchildren like the night light function as well.
NEG 	My newly found series obsession
NEG 	I sort of became an instant fan of Kylie Scott after reading Trust and I was super stoked to see what else she had to offer. Chaser was definitely not a disappointment, though to be honest, it was pretty much a home run when I saw that the heroine was pregnant when she meets the hero. I'm basically trash for stories where the male lead is an unapologetic man slut (but not in a bad way), then fights tooth and nail when confronted with the one woman that makes him actually FEEL, and proceeds to fall head over heels for her. That's definitely the case with Eric and Jean and it has the added bonus of him falling in love with her baby as well! The tension that was created because of the contentious relationship between Eric and Nell (which totally made me want/need to read the first two books in the series to get the background on all of that) and between Jean and her parents elevated the book above standard romance fluff. I loved Jean and Eric as characters and their chemistry was just delicious! I can't wait to devour more from Kylie Scott and I hope we get more in the Dive Bar series. 4 out of 5 wine glasses.
NEG 	Very comfy and sturdy.
NEG 	My grandson is very interested in science so I ordered these. These are so cute. I took off one star because the names (label) are not specific enough.
NEG 	The dark chocolate truffles are amazing! The milk chocolate ones aren't as good as the ones that come out for Valentine's Day. There is a greater amount of chocolate in these than in the truffle hearts, which makes the milk chocolate a bit more overwhelming than I would like. I would order a tin of just the dark chocolate, or stick to the hearts in the future.
NEG 	As advertised. However one of the first did not work. It was promptly replaced.
NEG 	Lacking in durability.... one bin is already caved in.
NEG 	reinforce area that draw string goes through son pulled string thru both holes now cant use drawstring due to no place to attach
NEG 	I give it #4, starts bc it holds creams and shampoo great but not oils :( so don't do oil specially if you are flying. Love it bc it can go in your carrying on. Bc of the wide mouth, it's easy to clean. Love the colors. It comes with labels so thats helpful. I do recommend this product. For what you pay and what you get, it's worth it.
NEG 	I like it’s many pockets. I would like it better with a bungee cord.
NEG 	I bought the 5 color set and tested all of them. I was a bit puzzled as to why they made a dark pink and a light pink one - personally. I would have preferred subbing out the light pink set for a purple or red. The colors and sparkle show up well enough on black and white paper with one layer, but on dark paper look much better with at least 2 layers (be careful though because multiple pass-throughs will start soaking through the papers and I noticed particularly with the light pink marker that it picked up black paper fibers). Overall, these are fun markers and I will enjoy having them in my collection, but if you are looking for the best sparkle pens, my first recommendation is the Uniball Signo brand. I also have the Sakura Gelly sparkles, and I would consider those second - they both have way more colors and don't soak through the paper. I see the advantage of the sharpie ones in that their uses will extend beyond paper but that's about it.
NEG 	This was very pretty only con i have is a couple of the latex balloons had holes in them
NEG 	I love both polishes. The matte is a little streaky but I still like it
NEG 	Dogs love them. Good price.
NEG 	Works great. The door to VHS player does not close properly, but it doesn't hurt anything.
NEG 	The bulbs are great but 2 were damaged. I ordered enough to have 2 in reserve so I had enough working bulbs to replace all of my non-working bulbs. I would order again.
NEG 	The hose for sawdust removal is pretty flexible and sturdy. Bag has ties to cinch to hose. You will need Teflon tape to complete assembly. Can’t really beat the price on this- sure it won’t be the same quality as the high quality brands but unless you’re using this constantly I’d say it’ll do the job. So long story short, if you’re a finish carpenter maybe go with a bigger badder orbital but if you’re a weekend warrior go ahead and purchase it.
NEG 	Like the sound of the head phones. Ear piece a little funny but all in all a good pair!
NEG 	Oh my goodness! Love the colors in this eyeshadow kit. It goes on very easy and washes off very well. I love the assortment of colors. You can mix and match or even blend the shades together to create a masterpiece. Getting another definitely once this is finished.
NEG 	Good product. I am a professional landscaper and have been doing lawn care for over 20 years, I have never seen anything as easy to use as this machine. First impressions is that this equipment is light enough for anyone to use and easy to operate, though it does lack some power. Will cut through some thick vegetation with relative ease, but long grass tends to wrap around the head and shaft, especially if you take it too fast. The line that come with the unit does ok but takes a lot of power to use it. I changed the line worth desert vortex trimmer line and the cut was much better and allowed the engine to be used at about half throttle while doing normal trimming. Great product for anyone with a back injury like me as you do not have to carry the unit just push. I really like that I can trim under objects and that I never seem to have any grass on my legs when I am done. This machine will come in handy allowing me to do some trimming now rather than just mowing all the time, all while saving my back! Once I get used to how it handles, it will be a great addition to my fleet of equipment.
NEG 	So far so good the first one I got just stopped working the second time I turned it on, Amazon took it back refunded my money and send me a new one.
NEG 	I have read a lot of books about business and also on how to achieve success, and if you've been reading my reviews you'd know I normally rave about how these books have used real-life experiences to back up their ideas. This book is different though, because the author's ideas were backed up by scientific evidences! How tremendously cool is that? I love how short and seemingly concise this book is, it gave me a good sense of fulfillment that I was able to finish reading another book. CEOs and businessmen, who I believe is the main target audience of this book, are busy people and they don't have much time for themselves so I think this is a great book for them to read. But let me also point out that this book didn't disappoint, the author's unique approach to achieving success is quite fascinating, especially that part where he implies something about karma - the idea that you will get in whatever shape and form anything that you've done. I highly recommend this book to those who are looking for a different approach, or unique ideas when it comes to achieving success. I wish to read more books like this.
NEG 	works great for me, feels good quality. Took one star because it's expensive for plastic piece.
NEG 	The shoe is a lot more flimsy than expected. To get the support that I would expect around the foot, you need to more multiple pairs of socks. However, I do like the color.
NEG 	Easy and safe way to transport my elderly pup. Some of the threading came undone on the underside of the bottom after just one use. I kept the packaging that it came it to store it when not in use but it would be really nice if it came with some kind of sack or pouch or something more permanent to store it.
NEG 	Way better than I expected! mixes really well with just water. I use a eletric blender however I believe it could mix well on a shake bottle as well. I purchased the chocolate flavor it has a dark chocolate taste, which I personally appreciate. Slightly weird after taste but nothing that will make you gag. I will definitely purchase again!
NEG 	Can’t beat the price! Definitely worth it. They do feel like they will probably get faded quick here in Los Angeles during the summer though. UPDATE: one of the shirts came with a hole in the armpit area
NEG 	like the bag... no issues
NEG 	I've been using it for more than 6 months, and it has been working as expected. However, the plastic filter that comes with the set doesn't change the top water flavor that much. Because of that, I decided to use the filtered water for cooking or coffee, which tasted better. There are better cylindrical filters to replace the default one, though.
NEG 	Great looking phone case. Beautiful leather and masculine looking. Quality throughout.
NEG 	Good looking rubber mats. Also fits over factory inserts nicely.
NEG 	The price for Green was a premium over black, blue, and red. What's that all about ?
NEG 	It was a funny surprise on our anniversary to wake up to this toilet paper! It was also way over priced. It’s one roll of tp for $12 definitely a one time buy. It’s like Scott tp
NEG 	I use these in an automotive shop in Maine where we constantly have air hammers and impacts banging around. They are an ear saver and comfortable for the most part. Nothing fancy about them but they work for me.
NEG 	It helps to moisturize and keeps it hydrated as sleeping pack but it has some artificial scent to it!
NEG 	Bought this to wear to a Vikings game. Didn't make it to the game but I looked good watching the TV. lol
NEG 	I like this clock/radio because it has all the features I was looking for. It has dual alarms so I can leave both alarms set with out changing the alarm for another time. Great reception on the stations I want to wake up to. Setting the radio presets is a little hard but I finally got them set. Overall a good product and what I needed.
NEG 	This product is very nice. It is light weight, has a lot of compartments for various items. The only problem that I have is that the black is really dark and hard to find things. I think the zippers on the inside should have little tags to indicate there is a compartment.
NEG 	This is the best all natural gum I've found. It tastes good and lasts a decent amount of time. Highly recommend PUR products when opting to get away from all the dangerous chemicals used in traditional gum manufactures.
NEG 	I liked the quality of the material. It fits small to large. They stretch to fit any hand size.
NEG 	Be very careful with this, it made all my clothes tight on me.
NEG 	The chain is very short for standard adult but still looks beautiful. Only problem I have found so far, is when is arrived it was knotted in the back.
NEG 	Nice tablecloth, but mine had some minor sewing imperfections. Perhaps other would not have even noticed, but I'm very picky. I decided to return it.
NEG 	Full charge did't last long as I hope it would, but it work just fine.
NEG 	Was hoping for something a little more adjustable. Great product if it’s going to stay in a fixed location. Kinda hard to see out the back window so I loosen the straps when the pup’s not in the hatch. The straps are obnoxiously long which may be needed with some car attachments/configurations. Not sure exactly how long, but feels like 6ft when all I needed was 6in.
NEG 	Works great with my Samsung g7 edge. Use it on my desk at work and at the end of the day, my phone is always still at 100 percent. The only con is that it does produce a slight whistling sound but nothing too loud that some low music can't cover up.
NEG 	Looks Real Not much heat
NEG 	This is a nice mirror for my teenage girl
NEG 	the history is okay.
NEG 	I like the shower head.
NEG 	Very cool but not exactly the same color I was expecting something more brown looking, as on the picture, but it is more yellowish/greenish
NEG 	These lamps were exactly what I was looking for. Very affordable. Very minimalist. And very simple to install. I purchased Edison bulbs to 'spruce' them up and give a nice amber glow to the room. The lighting creates such a cozy glow and I love that they don't take up table space like a traditional lamp would. I have ordered more since my first purchase.
NEG 	I like that is glossy and very light weight. It does seems to protect but if you drop your phone a lot I woudl recommend something heavier. It’s very good looking..
NEG 	Good product. Loved how both sides had choices to work with
NEG 	Good book on Custer and the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Would recommend.
NEG 	This is a product I purchased before and it is consistent with my last purchase
NEG 	Looks good and solid construction. Should do just fine!
NEG 	This is a terrific dramatization of a lovely book... But please note that it is an abridged version of the original text. I am listening to this Radio Theater version with my 9-year-old son. Each character is played by a different actor which makes it easier for my son to understand the dialogue. For those who are passionate about the original text I recommend the unabridged audiobook performed by Canadian actress, Rachel McAdams. This recording is so enjoyable that I will definitely purchase more stories from Focus on the Family Radio Theater.
NEG 	It is sooo adorable but I find it a bit small. I have to pack lunch, 2 snacks and water and sometimes it doesn't fit too comfortably. But overall it works!
NEG 	Soft and good quality yarn, but a bit small for a man’s head, the moustache part goes into the mouth
NEG 	I like the product for the purpose I need it for, my outdoor Christmas decorations. It is light weight, and I think the plastic will hold up well enough in the weather.
NEG 	This product would interfere with my vision to the point I had to stop using it.
NEG 	Nice smell, indeed as some reviewers said more masculine than lavender or espresso. Coffee? Not at all. Hands feel smooth after use, but using it since few days regularly and no visible change of dried skin
NEG 	I had gotten the DC Vintage calendar the past two years, but it was on backorder forever this year and I saw they had shrunk the dimensions for no good reason. This one has good art choices but the design has the fold going through the picture, so it's less aesthetically pleasing, especially if you want to keep a picture to hang. For the price, a good calendar
NEG 	Took three of us to assemble it but it’s a sturdy item and works well.
NEG 	Packaging was solid. Solid case for storage. Has everything you need to get started. Everything was in good shape, and I’ve got no complaints so far after the first few times I’ve had it out
NEG 	Beautiful picture and fun to do, the only thing I didn’t like was that they never got back to me about a bag of diamonds that was missing from the order.
NEG 	In the photo, the colors look more green. In person, it’s more aqua/turquoise. Still super cute and fits perfectly, but just not my preferred color palette.
NEG 	I almost returned this! I thought it wasn't compatible with my Arlo but it ended up fine. However, we had to cut away some of the rubber on the end so it would fit into the Arlo plug. It wasn't quite reaching and it wouldn't charge. Once we did this, it was fine.
NEG 	This is a cute castle that the kids love playing with. The only down fall is that they didn't make enough secure connecting pieces that attach the top parts to the bottom section so the top tier falls off easily. I'm constantly having to help rebuild.
NEG 	I have only ever owned 2 booklights. I think this one works just fine. Sometimes I have to adjust it depending on which part of the page I'm reading but so far it works as intended.
NEG 	I compete in Cowboy Action Shooting and needed protection that would let me ear what I need to hear with good noise protection I have only been able to use mine once because of cold weather but it did what I wanted. It allowed me to carry on conversations while others were shooting, listen to instruction, hear the timer beep and respond to any commands. I needed to increase the volume to accomplish this which does reduce the noise protections somewhat. Because of the increased volume I was hearing funny sound when others were shooting but I did not have wind noise. I talked to the Walkers Company and indicated the increase sound level was probably causing the strange noises. What I was using before cut off all hearing so this was a great upgrade. I look forward to playing to see if I can get what I need but possible reduce the strange noises. I just wish I had bought one of these sooner. Not sure I would want to try it in an enclosed area.
NEG 	Super cute top that looks just like the picture. I thought this would be longer but still fits.
NEG 	Works well and looks nice. But cheaply made and cheap material. You get what you pay for. Washes well and does the job though.
NEG 	Although I was able to fix it with basic carpentry, the wood base where the metal pole connects broke the first time someone sat on the couch. That was quite a disappointment. Fortunately, no one was hurt. You get what you pay for?
NEG 	I only have 4 stars because I'm not using it like I should but from the first use I've seen a change. Will try to keep up
NEG 	I haven't used yet. I bought this for an up coming trip to the Dominican. It appears to be built very well but I have not used yet.
NEG 	Very cute top. Looks just as pic. However the sizing seems to run small. I think this looks like either it’s a Youth size or a fitted tee top. I ordered a XL but usually am a L.
NEG 	i really liked this rack, however it did not work on my bike because i don't have enough seat post available to attach it to. I will need to get a frame mounted rack instead. i am returning it.
NEG 	Nice set.... Very complete.... Tight case!
NEG 	My kids and I loved these. They were perfect prizes for a birthday party! The guests loved them as well. Only downside was there was one less pikachu than expected and one extra pikachu ear lol. I have a 1yr old and 5 yr old and none of the toys have broke on us yet.
NEG 	Very nice and easy to use. The scents are wonderful.
NEG 	They fit very tight I was surprised it's never happened to me before
NEG 	I do like it. It's a little thinner than I thought it would be, but it has a nozzle with several settings so it works well for me to rinse off the mower, car and driveway.
NEG 	I like the organization included in the bag and insert -- and wish it had more! For example, I wish the insert that holds brushes had pouches for brushes on both sides instead of one side only. On another note, I am a bit concerned that the foundation compact I placed in the pocket on the inside of the lid had cracked the first time I pulled it out to use it. I'm not sure what happened to crack it. :( The mirror inside the compact was fine, so perhaps it's a problem with the makeup rather than the storage. Overall, I'm very pleased with this bag and recommend this to hold and carry makeup.
NEG 	I like the size and the beauty of each stone was given to me. I can also feel their energies that they are radiating off. The only thing that would have given this review a 5 star is because the Clear Quartz is missing from this set of 8 stones. EIGHT. E-I-G-H-T. Not seven or six, but eight.
NEG 	I bought this to hold my reading glasses and it performs well for that. No issues.
NEG 	I think it’s ok, it’s the price she be less, or the bottle should be bigger, that’s just my opinion, I’m trying some other ones to see which one I like the best
NEG 	I bought this for my apartment. Previously, I used an antenna I bought from Best Buy that was supposed to be an upgraded model. I get many more channels with the boosted antenna, and everything comes in clearer with better sound. There's only one station I want, but can't receive. It barely came in with the old one, but doesn't come in at all with the new one. Overall, I'm very satisfied.
NEG 	Decent read with good ideas.
NEG 	Pretty good for the price. A little too sticky compared to Bubbles Salon's Sticky Rice pomade (I think they're only in the DC area.), but this is half the cost. Not sure how this was one of the top listings for 'natural' pomade though from looking at the 5 lines of ingredients.
NEG 	Case was very supportive and did the job.
NEG 	Very long for residential use. Better suited or commercial use.
NEG 	This was one of my book club books and sometimes I read them and sometimes I don't. I read this one, and I've ordered the sequel and I'm halfway through that and I understand that there is another one still. This was a rich story. It is told with emotion and character and excellent descriptions of the territory and the issues of the historic time. I live in Texas, so I am familiar with some of the territory addressed in this novel and the descriptions are comfortably accurate. I am unfamiliar with the people that moved from Texas to Arizona so this was a vibrant telling of their adventure. As a student of genealogy and history, this gives me such a colorful concept of the issues of the early settlers in this territory. I am the grandchild and great-grandchild of farmers and ranchers. Country people had particular issues and needed tremendous strengths. The fact that I exist is because of hearty people such as the ones described in this story.
NEG 	Seems to be a high quality purse for the price. All the separate pockets are what I look for in a purse
NEG 	This tv stand is beautiful, only thing is it is a little bit smaller than what you see in the pictures.
NEG 	Lots of color options, the software is slowly improving so the product works better now than when initially released. Lots of freaking wires involved though. The color novelty wears off rather fast. The fact that it requires multiple connectors that cost an additional amount on top of the rgb products themselves if you want to use multiple products from their rgb line makes it rather expensive just for some fancy lights.
NEG 	I was skeptical about these light bars at first so I ran my own silicone around the lenses and where the wiring enters the housing and so far they work great, I have two behind the grill of my pickup and I live in an area with high moisture.
NEG 	The bearing kit worked well but the dust caps did not fit so I reused the old ones. The cotter keys were a bit long but usable.
NEG 	Love it and results!! Only thing is it was pretty messy
NEG 	Good item . Would buy again. As described !
NEG 	Pretty good product for the price. The tools are great for adjusting the band, should work with other bands as well. The replacement pins did rust a bit, but that’s not a big deal to me.
NEG 	Nice part,fast shipping, knob feels a little loose but works ok.
NEG 	An enlightenment for anyone involved in a toxic relationship, not just a partner. This book helped me understand and maneuver my future relations with my narcissistic and sociopathic sister.
NEG 	Perfect cover but the rubber does not fit that tight.
NEG 	I like that the radar detector came in just a couple days. Very happy with it. Just wish the speaker on the radar detector was a little better not that it’s bad but it could come out a little clearer and be a little louder. Over all am very happy with this product.
NEG 	Could you make this? Probably. Do you want to spend the time to make it? Probably not. That being said. These are exactly as advertised. They are felt coasters but are a bit thicker than just regular felt. It has firm support underneath so it is not extremely flimsy. If you are expecting some rock hard coasters, look elsewhere. This works well with my glass table since it is not heavy or hard. They look exactly like the photos/description.
NEG 	Simple to use and appears of good quality.
NEG 	Good story, kept me reading all day instead of getting my laundry and yard work done, much to my dismay.
NEG 	Feels sturdier than previous models. Good light duty scanner. Use it a few times a day.
NEG 	Colors are nice. Like it. Comes with remote. But no stand
NEG 	This is a product that I have bought before and I just bought another set due to the fact that I lost my older ones. Out of all the TSA approved ones I have tried, I have like these the best even though they are sometimes a pain to use.
NEG 	Very nice. The set I received is not quite as brilliant as the photos but still quite pretty. My wife likes them.
NEG 	Sheets felt very good not cheap material. Deep pockets so they fit my Queen size mattress vey good without constantly tucking in again
NEG 	Love the basket. But it does not completely.
NEG 	Was a bit snug around my thigh but served it's purpose.
NEG 	It's light weight and fairly comfortable. Tight on checks and a little loose in other places. Helmet lift at higher speeds
NEG 	This chair is great for the price. I use it daily and it’s a bit uncomfortable after sitting in it for more than 4 hours. But very happy with the purchase
NEG 	The silicone cups and stirrers are great! The tweezers aren’t really very sturdy and bend easily but they are usable. The finger cots are too small and hurt to wear. Still a good deal.
NEG 	They're soft, which is nice. But that also means they don't hide lumps. Still cute, though.
NEG 	Nice shades. Only draw back are that the arms scratch my head when I put them on.
NEG 	Nice case overall. Put this on my tmobile J3 prime and the fit is perfect. I'm docking a start just because the volume buttons are difficult to push compared to some other UAG cases I've owned.
NEG 	The swivel doesn't hold had three the swivels were the first to go even if you leave it in the same position over all it's a good case a little glue fixed it.
NEG 	I love this bag. The only drawback for me is that I can’t fit my large water bottle in it.
NEG 	Love the final product. Written instructions are horrible. My advice is to go to YouTube for instructions. Wishing for different colors/designs.
NEG 	Soft and comfortable! They do seem to shrink a bit if you dry them in a clothes dryer.
NEG 	ok for camping tapestry, will work to help block out sun. material is raw cut on edges, kinda just like cut off bolt of fabric. for price it is as expected. colors are not exactly like in photo but again you get what you paid for
NEG 	They were good as far as communicating at a timely manner. However, they did not send me the correct shower curtain design I requested. I had sent them one example of what I wanted and then I changed my mind and edited it accordingly. The sent me a curtain with the original design on it. Colors were perfect, etc. I let them know it was wrong and they offered my money back. I requested them to keep my money and to just send me a curtain of the 2nd design I asked for. When I received that one, the colors changed and did not match my bathroom decor. They gave me a refund.
NEG 	good product at a good price
NEG 	i needed a cheap dress shoe, and these were it. wore them several times now, still look nice, only minimal wear showing. doubt they will hold up after 6-12 months of constant use but for the price i'm very happy.
NEG 	Its cool but it's not very loud
NEG 	Love this type of hanger for an adult however for little ones pieces of clothing it would be a quicker on/off using regular cheap smaller plastic hangers 😕
NEG 	This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and I have liked these a lot. Great sound- nice that u can adjust the bass with the app. Material feels a little brittle and seems like it would scratch but it has held up well and 1 small scratch. Comfortable but after 45 min my ears get sweaty. Streaming movies I notice occasional sound lag. Not sure if this is true for all bluetooth headphones. Not much flex when u put them on but adjust well to my head. Hard to tell whem batt is low although app does show u. Very good overall--a little overpriced you pay for brand name I guess.
NEG 	Nice condom but same feel as their standard condom.
NEG 	Love the music. Great collection. Disappointed that this music did not download to My Music on Amazon music.
NEG 	This was not the best study bible I have purchased, and i have purchased several. The commentary seemed wordy and did not break down the scripture as I expected.
NEG 	This was a gift for a medical student just beginning a surgical rotation. The kit is great! It was difficult to access the e-book. I had to convert it to a word document and I noticed there were some typos in it (nothing major!). Suturing is definitely challenging, and perhaps if a video were included with the e-book that would be helpful. But there is always YouTube. All of that said, the equipment is great, and it's a great starter kit! Would recommend.
NEG 	After about four times washing the MASH logo started disappearing. Can barely see now.
NEG 	My father loved the socks, fit perfect.
NEG 	They were really thin.
NEG 	Super cute journal!! Love the unicorn. Very popular right now. My daughter looooves the light up feature on here. There is an ink pen with secret ink. It's not that strong but I can see it a little bit. Cute idea for a stocking stuffer!!
NEG 	This is my go to lotion for eczema flare ups for my toddler. I ordered it through Amazon for the convenience and would give 5 stars if it were priced to match the actual company's (Melaleuca Wellness Company) price for the product. It was convienent to receive it so quickly though. As with most products from Melaleuca Wellness Company, the longer you use it, the less of the product you have to use the next time. That only equals great value to their amazing products!
NEG 	The darts work fine but they don’t really glow very well.
NEG 	I bought it for my daughter who loves knock knock jokes. It is very thin book it took her less than 15 min to read. Some jokes are hilarious and some are not. Overpriced for what you get. But still cute.
NEG 	Great mystery, successful twist, engaging characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I need to get my hands on the next one soon.
NEG 	Looks great on the wife.
NEG 	A high quality product product is compatible with things the seller said But I found cheaper price
NEG 	Compact and easy to carry. Was shorter in length than I expected.
NEG 	A fast paced, action filled, thriller. Enters with Lady Catherine's visit to Longbourn and it starts with a bang. After Lady Catherine's visit, Elizabeth immediately fell violently ill. Muscle cramps and unable to keep anything down, she was hauled off to the servants quarters not to inflict the rest of the family with her ailment. Mrs Bennet showed her lack of maternal skills, in every way possible and her manners was no better... Mr Darcy enters the fray and takes action to save Elizabeth's life most admirably while he stumbled upon a possible culprit. The hunt to find the guilty as well as finding a fitting punishment, was a major part of the book. Ends in a HEA. Would have loved to see a bit more interaction between ODC but I loved the plot. Recommend.
NEG 	They run small and tight. Love the shoe but my pinky toe was slightly raw after 18. I wouldn't walk in these unless they fit well.
NEG 	Absolutely love our Eureka!! We have now had it for 3 years and it is still running as good as new. Easy to clean and maintain. It pulls so much dirt and filth from the carpets.
NEG 	It was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it. All of her friends want to purchase one.
NEG 	I’m allergic and this lotion calmed my allergies. It’s a great alternative to Vick’s and it’s pretty mild so I even used for my two year old when he had the sniffles. The directions say to put on bottom of feet, chest and temples. Works nicely.
NEG 	Was looking for a truly plush Santa hat. This one was exactly it. Made with quality materials. Thick fabric and soft fuzzy white trim. Highly recommend!
NEG 	Moving, dramatic, and ends on a happy note. Overall quality of writing was good. Characters and plot were well thought out and kept the attention from first to last page. Would have liked to see more once Abigail and Liam reconnected before jumping into the epilogue.
NEG 	Love it so far. Feels sturdy and blocks the sun from a big area but that's more to do with the type of sunglasses. Haven't had time to test out polarized part but will see.😎
NEG 	I bought this tablet a while back and I absolutely love it. My only issue is that when I'm drawing it just stops working and won't start again until I restart the computer. Anyone have any idea how to fix it?
NEG 	I needed this because my original band holder had torn. A new band was simply too costly, and I was skeptical of the cheaper replacement bands. This pack of 10 holders is excellent value. It fits slightly different from the original, which was a bit more pliable. This feels like a harder rubber, but does not really affect how it fits/works on the original band. It has the inner tab to help secure the watchband.
NEG 	Great protection but dropped it once and it chipped. I bought a case in the Apple store and dropped it 10+ times and never chipped.
NEG 	I bought for 6 years old son. Enough capacity and durability.
NEG 	I enjoyed the story line and the fact that I could not stop reading. I liked how each character had their own chapter.
NEG 	I suffer from fibromyalgia. My doctor suggested zinc to help with my memory issues. I have seen a slight improvement. I love that is non-gmo, vegan, and gluten-free. There is also no mast flavor or bad aftertaste
NEG 	It's not bad. Pretty handy for a small thing. Will bring this for travel!
NEG 	It's nice and all just a bit awkward to lock it in place by your self but it does look great!
NEG 	I thought this worked quite well and it certainly sped things up. The shaft has a hex shape so it doesn’t slip in the drill. We have pretty heavy soil and I didn’t have any trouble but you also have to hold the drill firmly like you would for any job or, yes, it is likely to give your wrist a jerk.
NEG 	Gave as a gift to an outdoorsman. It was enjoyed.
NEG 	This is the 2nd one I've purchased and considering the first one lasted 3 years I would say it's decent quality! The closing strap gets a little worn but that's to be expected.
NEG 	Asked for black got brown instead. Not terribly upset so I won’t go through the hassle of getting another one. It seems pretty decent though
NEG 	I used this for my mobile cb as a base power supply works perfect no air noise typical of cheaper supply's
NEG 	Great product structurally. I bought the white one and probably should have known better. It has stained like crazy and look dingy/dirty even after trying to clean it. I suggest product just make sure you go with another color other than white.
NEG 	A beautiful read that delicately addresses a dark moment post ww2. I enjoyed this book and look forward to more by the author.
NEG 	We used these for around our banister during the holidays. They are perfect with all the controls for the settings. Recommend.
NEG 	Giving this a 4 star based on the intensity of the Color. I love how these covers add a pop of just the right accent tone to make it all work.
NEG 	They’re super cute! Hopefully ther person I got them for will love them!
NEG 	Frankly, I bought this because my niece is an artist and loves these kinds of graphic novels. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is the artwork very nice but the story is actually good! The plot is strong and moves quickly and is not good for young kids, making it much more interesting for adults.
NEG 	What happens if someone stole your phone??
NEG 	The size of the bottles are great for hot oil mixtures, but the bottles do not come with holes at the top. The little red caps snap on very nicely, but a person could be extra careful when sitting the tops down, because it seems that because they are so small and not tethered to the nozzle, it seems that the red caps could get misplaced easily.
NEG 	I love David's War Gods Own series and while this starts a new series, it still has some of the characters from the War God's Own. I am happy to have this on my Kindle and will definitely be buying the rest of the series when it comes out.
NEG 	Love this product! Mascara is now optional! My only complaint is that it doesn’t last 90 days, but more like 30 days for me.
NEG 	so full of wonderful stretch ideas as well as the "whys" and what it will help with. I like that it also offers complimentary stretches. as a side note- this has nothing to do with the book but how Amazon ships the book. Putting a book in a soft envelope does NOT work. The corners get all mangled and bent. This is the second book this has happened with in the last week. The replacement was bent up a little as well but nothing like the first. I only post this here because I don't see a place to review packaging or leave comments. Amazon- customers pay new book price and expect a book not all bent up and crumbled.
NEG 	Love it. Only problem is that it is a little hard to put in. Love that you can adjust the size. My wrists are so tiny and took off 2 hooks and fits perfect. Easy to switch out the bands and actually stays on
NEG 	I like these for the price but they have some issues they flicker some times n when they are just normal not dark they are green n like kinda dark to begin with so I cant wear em inside all day like I wish they were clear then go dark but for the price they work fine n if ya just throw em on for 10 min here n there for spot welding there perfect or in my case plasma burning they wrk
NEG 	They're great, I only wish the had the big number 2 on the side of the nipple instead of the rim, it's hard to tell the size without searching for it
NEG 	Wanted the inline nose pieces but no longer available. Seller tried to resolve but desired parts no longer available.
NEG 	They are hard, flat, and brown!
NEG 	Fits good looks good to wear it often.
NEG 	I really liked this book. Sweet not too over the top with the sex scenes. It was heart reaching and loving at the same time. Although I could have already predicted who did what I still couldn't put down this book. I eager to finish it.
NEG 	Small, easy to handle. Down side is wishing they were sharper.
NEG 	So far, my cats really enjoy this laser toy. We usually run it in the dark as we go upstairs to bed, that way the cats can get some energy out for the night. We've had other laser toys in the past and they always broke after a while. We like this one because it's mounted up high with no chance of our cat accidentally knocking it over. I like that it has a suction cup to attach to things like glass or a mirror. It runs for several minutes and has a large area of play. The only thing I wish it had was a remote start or a timed start. So you could have it run on its own without you pressing a button to get it going. But other than that it's been great.
NEG 	Love this mask! So elegant. The eye part is a tad bit smaller than what i wanted overall just what i wanted
NEG 	My 2nd grader is reading in bed every night now. Wish the neck would move easier.
NEG 	Great product so far, especially for the price. My only complaint is that the edges aren't entirely flush with the screen.
NEG 	This is the 2nd stand purchased & we hope to get more than 1 year and 11 mos. out of this one. The photo is of the 1st one & my husband & I were in it when we crashed to the ground! The end grazed the side of my head & slammed him on the wrist & knee leaving bruises. We were playing with our cat & if he had been under when we fell it would have killed him! Overall we have been happy with the stand...until it broke! There were o visible signs of rust or wear when it was assembled. I would suggest inspecting frequently to avoid injury.
NEG 	First one arrived broken. This one worked fine only it was the thermal fuse that was my problem
NEG 	They have to come rolled up to ship, but they are hard to flatten out. I left them straightened out and under heavy books for 2 weeks and they still have a definite curvy. Other than that they are great! I will be ordering them again.
NEG 	Not exactly same model that came on my mower but it works like it.. Only reason down one star.
NEG 	I held off on giving 5 stars until I accidental drop it. With the raised ends, I don't think the screen will ever crack. Was easy to install, it took all of a minute. I bought the blue for my blue Note9, it highlights the blue phone well. I'm typing this with dragon swype and am not having any issues. Enjoy, it's well worth the money so far!
NEG 	Pretty nice but I wish it wasn’t paper underneath. Seems kind of flammable for being inside a sauna.
NEG 	Does the job. Had to return the first one because it randomly stopped working. Replacement seems to be slaying bugs so far
NEG 	I wear a small in tops. As other reviews I ordered 1 size up and the medium fits perfect. The only issue I have is the threading is thin at bottom and on 1 tank the thread broke after 1 wash and started to unravel.
NEG 	Arrived on time. Present. I was actually disappointed in the size. It's about the size of a baseball. I probably didn't really pay too much attention to the product size in the details (if it's even in there). I don't know if he likes it, but will update as soon as I find out.
NEG 	Quality is actually better than I expected and delivery was right on time as I have come to expect from Amazon. Price for value at this point looks extremely good. I have not used this item yet but will update when I do.
NEG 	Perfect. Great laughs but they do have an app for Mad libs that I was unaware of.
NEG 	Was a cute way to send a gift card.
NEG 	Use this with my mom who has fragile skin that tear open. Great to protect and heal. Only thing is price, but it is a great product
NEG 	Bought this as my personal item for flight to Alaska. Have a ton of things in there including purse, jacket, snacks, extra set of clothes, few toiletries, iPad, etc. Plenty of room.
NEG 	This is a beautiful flag and we had it up all of April! Exactly as described and came in as expected.
NEG 	High quality belt. Performs as expected. Easy to trim and use. I like the fact that it can be easily laundered if desired. It seems to be very durable. Lastly, it doesn’t look at all like some kind of an odd belt - it blends in nicely with normal attire.
NEG 	Dislike the color it was not as expected. Used them for a Halloween costume
NEG 	Bought this for my son, he loves it, he says it was easy to follow and understand.
NEG 	Was looking for a pouch that can protect my keys out in public and bag does the job 100%. My personal problem is the bag feeling too large and tough for me to have in my pocket or dangling from my belt.
NEG 	nice colors and fabric
NEG 	Product looks well made but the only down side is that no butane comes with the lighter
NEG 	Then poles were great, they came with no damage, and they were the correct length. Only issue was that the ending poles were not specified, they were not correct, couldn’t fit the poles around the tent peice.
NEG 	This mattress is super comfortable and works well for my daughter's room. She loves it and is eager to go to bed each night, which is a huge plus in my book! Shipping took a few extra days, even though I bought it as a Prime purchase. Also, its definitely not 10 inches thick, maybe 8 inches at most. It took about 2 & 1/2 days to fully shape up.
NEG 	Some material is already separating. The measurements and size are right on the money.
NEG 	I have been wanting this style of necklace for a while, but was looking for an affordable one. This one fit the bill and I got to customize it with the amount of discs I wanted on it. I love it and get complements on it all the time. I love it so much I hate taking it off!
NEG 	I love this for work! It hold quite a bit and the proportions of each section are just right.
NEG 	The "jacket" was good for winter-time walks....sadly, our dog really didn't like it much and preferred to just take walks in "her fur" rather than with the jacket so we didn't use it much. No problem with the jacket...just the dog's preference.
NEG 	The package is a little shabby but the opener itself is good
NEG 	Comfortable fit. They fit ok with over the ear hearing protection. The main drawback is the neck cord that comes off a little too easily. You really have to jam them on far.
NEG 	Great pkging . Very secured. Fools everyone who looks at it. A bit larger than expected and that’s a good thing.
NEG 	The cut doesn’t look like the pic but I’m not built like that model either
NEG 	Fun game! Not too hard. Great to play to pass the time, not too complicated.
NEG 	I'm not a fan of the scent and it burns my eyes when trying to remove mascara and eye makeup. Or really around the eye area. But it gets other makeup off fine.
NEG 	I only received one shaker in the basket...
NEG 	This arrived earlier than I thought, great. Went together extremely easy, packaged well, arrived in great shape. Being made of hard plastic, it is a bit light, so when not using or on windy days may have to bungee cord it around the grills of my deck. You get what you pay for and this will do just fine... I recommend it.
NEG 	Wished these came in 20 ounce size.
NEG 	Feels like the real thing suction works good too doesn’t have a smell to it when first opened and feels soft and smooth! Worth the money
NEG 	Professional Carpet cleaning company.
NEG 	Stretch wrap set arrived as expected Used the stretch wrap roll to wrap my luggage to protect them. Stretch wrap is useful for protecting the luggage from the baggage handlers. Handle is easy to use and roll around.
NEG 	these are okay. too high up the ankle for me. also made my feet stink really bad. not good at eliminating odor.
NEG 	It works good. I wish it had a hinge to adjust the angle. If you use a bulkier case your phone wont sit quite right on here. I use a Note 8 and my case is a heavier durable case. I need the charger to be able to lean back a little more so the phone sits on it better.
NEG 	This sound bar is really good for the price. It has nice bass and sound. It does not have a subwoofer or an input for it. But its sounds quilty is better than a lot out there
NEG 	Came early and fits good!
NEG 	I like this journal but I took a point because the useable paper is a bit narrower than I prefer for a sketchbook. The paper quality and the price are excellent. While I do not think this will replace my go to travel watercolor sketchbook, I would not hesitate to pick it up again in a pinch.
NEG 	It's a great phone case, except it partially covers the camera lens, so I had to take a drill bit to it to create a bigger hole.
NEG 	I had surgery on my leg and used saran wrap with this tape to keep water away from surgical area. I know this isn't meant for a shower and water, but it did great! It seems like once water penetrated, it would all loosen up very quickly. Again it is not meant for water, but i was very impressed. So if any of you want to take a shower and recently had surgery, I would recommend this. I had used other tapes claiming they were waterproof and did horrible. If I were using this as intended, I would have rated 5 stars.
NEG 	Great looking headlights. They are very clear and greatly increased my sight distance. The fitment is slightly off from the OEM and it took quite a bit of work to get them in place and to a spot where I could adjust them. Installed on 2004 Chevy Tahoe 5.3.
NEG 	The author created an interesting fantasy world and interesting characters to fill it. There's a lot of great imagination in this story.
NEG 	I am a college student who's hair falls our and it extremely dandruff prone due to stress. I have tried a lot of products but this one works the best. I have been using for over a month and my dandruff is nearly gone. I started using it every time I washed my hair and now I use it once a week along with my regular conditioner.
NEG 	Came on time, two in a box, worked well from the start, the alarm is loud enough to hear in another room. Read the manual to learn how to quickly re-set - otherwise it is easy to use right out of the box.
NEG 	good band for the price, I can tell it will not last a long time though.
NEG 	A better sound and higher volume.
NEG 	Great curler. Still trying to get used to the handles. I'm used to putting my thumb and middle finger through the holes, but, since this doesn't have that, it's a little hard getting used to. Other than that, it's a pretty good curler.
NEG 	I will say I was expecting something cheaply made but I really like this product! It's very soft and comfortable! The color is perfect and the fit is true to size! Definitely would be perfect with a pair of leggings!
NEG 	I wear it everyday an it’s been longer then 2weeks an it’s still hasn’t turned
NEG 	Belt is too short. Looks expensive. Fabric frays a lot
NEG 	I bought this to test it out as an item to keep in the vehicle for emergencies, I guess i will come back and do an update when I actually use it.
NEG 	Amazing pictures from the movie. The numbers are a little small though.
NEG 	These have been very helpful during our move. I do wish they were more durable though.
NEG 	This was a fun one! I love puzzles and this puzzle had all kinds of interesting shaped pieces. Some were so odd that I had no idea where they went. One of the border pieces had an edge so tiny that I didn't even know it was an edge. That drove me crazy for the entire time I worked the puzzle since I was worried a piece was missing (hence the four stars). The pieces were just a touch thin for my taste, but that's purely personal preference. They were plenty sturdy and I didn't have any issues with bending or tearing. Oh, and the picture was adorable!
NEG 	Good communication only received 1 of the 2 I ordered. They sent out 2 more and never received them. Such a shame
NEG 	....Fantastic Beasts Was entertaining but to me lacked the overall charm of Harry Potter movies ... But if you were a Harry Potter fan you should check this out ...
NEG 	Try these as wall jack adapters, good company with even better ones available that have two connecters the same size as one receptical.
NEG 	This rug is very thin. Feels like an indoor/outdoor rug. The colors are nice and true to the photo online. If you sit a table or something on it, it won't slide. Otherwise, you would need a pad.
NEG 	Some of the bags ripped bc I think I added too much stuff so be careful, so just added tape Lol Another thing is that some of the bags don't work well but others do. Sooo within this bag not all of them keep the air out over time, that doesn't mean they aren't all bad though. I'm a student that has limited closet space since I live with a roommate so these were overall helpful when I had to move.
NEG 	Clean reception and great sound quality. The mic picks up everything so be sure to use these in a quiet room when making calls. Easy to pair - make certain you read the instructions. Fairly comfortable and affordable.
NEG 	So far, it's a great little camera. Easy to operate without even looking at the manual. The video card isn't included, but they're cheap enough.
NEG 	Any dust will make installation difficult! I found that my problem was dust I never noticed under the glass protector. You can put the paperlike on top of the glass protector. Take the advice of a YouTuber too. Use scotch tape and not the bitty positioning stickers they send. My installation isn't perfect, but it is much nicer to draw on the Ipad even with dust bubbles. The negatives do not cancel out the positive, but I had to mention them.
NEG 	I like the fact it is wide enough and made of stainless steel. I do wish it had a rubber backing on the bottom though, just to protect my counter tops.
NEG 	I like these highlighters, only thing is the outside casing is made of cheap plastic so they do crack easily. One of mine came with a crack in it and it was dried out when I received it.
NEG 	Works fine, but not as well as I was hoping it would. It does get between the grates well. We’ll see how well it holds up.
NEG 	I little bit too sheer and thin but VERY pretty. I ended up purchased a total of 3 packs to make (6 panels).
NEG 	Seems very sturdy and a no brainer to set up but one of the levelers was missing.
NEG 	My daughter really loves these. She's allergic to down and feather pillows but the typical poly FIL pillows are too high or too flat or don't give enough to make her comfy. These were perfect and affordable. Well done here!!
NEG 	This is very warm and comfortable. Pocket allows for cat or small dog. There is a pocket for your hands and thumb hold design for comfort.
NEG 	Heats well, muted but audible whistle, holds a reasonable amount of water. Watch for steam getting under the handle, but otherwise it's great. Also, I love the color. :) We drink a LOT of tea, and also use it to boil water for rinsing out the drain.
NEG 	Nice looking got but loses one star for lack of instructions. I actually returned the first one of these I bought because I thought it was broken You have to unscrew the entire front all the way off and remove the little black piece of paper between the battery and the light. It would be nice if that was in the package information somewhere.
NEG 	Amazing Product for the price! I feel like im lying on the softest Alpaca fur. Only downside is its already starting to malt a bit but thats to be expected.
NEG 	It does what we needed it to!
NEG 	It is what it is. A decent water dish. I purchased it for my baby sulcata tortoises. It looks like they'll be able to drink from the lower parts of the dish. The bottle isn't big. Maybe 8oz. When you fill it, and turn it upside down, half the bottle is empty. The bottle doesn't screw in... It just sits in the opening, so I think I can use a 20oz bottle of I need to. Overall better than my flat dishes I was using before.
NEG 	Product arrived in good condition. My only disappointment was on how late it finally arrived. Amazon notified me around 10am or 11am my product arrived. It wasn't delivered until the evening. At that point, I no longer needed it. I did decide to keep the decorations for possible future use.
NEG 	Giving this review 4 stars because the battery life is not as stated. We feel like we have to charge it more frequently even if we have not used it in a while, the battery charge does not stay.
NEG 	NO COMMENT.... PRODUCT SERVE AS PURPOSE.....
NEG 	First one broke they sent me another very quickly I use it all the time
NEG 	These are great for my grandson - he is nearly three and virtually non-verbal so it is so much easier to use these when working on crafts with him than cups of water. The flow rate is great and they avoid mess. He finds them easy to use.
NEG 	DOES NOT FIT 07 CHEVROLET TRAILBLAZER AT ALL , ONLY THING THAT FIT IS THE HEAD REST COVERS WHICH ARE NO USE TO ME.
NEG 	It’s fine, fairly good quality, seems well made. Only problem, the watches kinda knock around in the case. They’re safe in there, but loose.
NEG 	Kitty get a lot of use out of this; she even likes to sit on it!
NEG 	Haven't used it long enough to see a huge difference in the amount of savings gained by not using so much chlorine.
NEG 	It is messy but I attribute that to the tin it comes in. Mine was not smooth to take the lid on or off. The powder is really fine so it tends to fly everywhere. I think it is worth it though. It did leave some black on my tongue and along my gum line even after I rinsed three times. I am using it at night so it didn’t bother me too much and I know it’s safe to digest. This is my first time using it so we’ll see how it goes. I’m planning on transferring it to a different container to reduce messes. I can already tell that this is going to last me for a long time.
NEG 	just a little hard to unscrew
NEG 	It serves its purpose
NEG 	I like everything about this case...
NEG 	It's not the moves in your life that count, it's the life in your movies. This movie was quite enjoyable.
NEG 	Gave to mmy grandson, he loves it.
NEG 	This thing has the power but it is really slow I knew that but wen you use it very time consuming even with the sharpest drill bit good for boron steel on new cars but my adapter that screws into the plastic handle keeps coming loose the threads are pulling out so my drill may be dun for soon I think 550 rpm would be better
NEG 	like I​ said before, great buy
NEG 	I really wanted to give this one a five star but certain aspects of the travel bag was an inconvenience. But to start... I loved the color especially being I have to match everything. And the thought of a rotational hook was great. The downside. The hook is really thin and seems a little cheep. It won’t last long. The side pockets are nice but too small to fit travel size items.
NEG 	Love this book. I felt the boxes were a bit to small but there is just a chance I am using this for a younger writer than its intended purpose. It really helps explain spacing and letter shapes
NEG 	Beautiful, well made dress. The lace has a little stretch to it, and is very durable. I wish the back wasn't pure lace to make it a little more modest, but we bought a white shirt sleeve leotard to go under it and it's perfect! My 7 year old LOVES this dress!!!! (Mom does too)
NEG 	Love these candies. I checked prices after the purchase & feel I overpaid.
NEG 	What a cool toy, personally the powder flavors are gross and don’t work the way They describe. But that’s easy enough to replace. My daughter has and does ice this toy.
NEG 	Good Product. Looks nice; however, the ring they put to open the box is a little to big for me. Overall good product.
NEG 	I found this book sweet and a fun read. Persuasion is my favorite Austen and I find it interesting to read such JAFF.
NEG 	This fits as expected. My princess really loves this outfit. This outfit waa constructed from fine material. Arrived on time, packaging intact.
NEG 	Bought many face mask over the past two yrs and so far this one is the best that I have found. If u we're glasses it's vented nice and your glasses don't fog up.
NEG 	I have a 5 Gal community tank, I bought this to extend my current filter tub to the bottom of my tank. One feature I like is this filter can help filter out plant leave and roots that often caught in the motor.
NEG 	Ordered these for a family cruise vacation to hold IDs and sail cards. Works very well. Cheaper than buying on the ship.
NEG 	Love this this work perfect for the dry skin that I have only a couple uses and I could tell a difference
NEG 	Does the job and my son liked the owl picture. However, the owl does rub off. We’ve only had it for a few days and the owl is nearly gone.
NEG 	This jacket is great for around the house when it is cool. Be sure to check the size my husband is a size small he is very thin and I purchased an XL and it fit him like a small.
NEG 	Highly visible, but reflective material on palm wears quickly. Great if you don't handle objects. Great for traffic control.
NEG 	It would be better if the lid would stay up. Its hard to hold the lid open and pour in the gravy at the same time. Works great to keep gravy warm.
NEG 	They stay in place with vigorous exercise. Sound quality is below average, but for the price it is well worth it.
NEG 	I love everything about the box but it didn't have a lining which was expected and it didn't say what tune it was playing. The reason that I bought it was because it had a key. Otherwise, I would have bought one of the more elegant ones without the key.
NEG 	Really great a hidden zipper in front so you do not have to fool with the buttons, really close as a replica WWII GI shirt. Replicas are almost 150.00. I ordered a large and that is what I got. Fits just fine. It is not cotton but I did not want cotton. It also has some hidden items hon it like the zipper and some Velcro holding down the shirt pockets.
NEG 	For bigger sized squares this is perfect. Easy to use and keeps your squares in place
NEG 	It works, but it does take muscle. If you don't have strong fingers, you will struggle with it.
NEG 	These socks are great, specifically if your feet will get wet.
NEG 	Very good to use off grid. I used this on deployment, and use every fruit the mess deck have to supply fiber to my diet. I have fun making smoothie because I burn more calorie to make it than consume it.
NEG 	I really do think these have helped regrow the hair I lost after having a baby and nursing for a year. They are nice to take, almost like a little snack or after dinner dessert because they are sweet like a gummy candy. They do have a bit of a funny aftertaste, but I can easily look past that for their benefits.
NEG 	I like one of them it’s really nice looking but out of the 4 piece I ordered one of them start tearing its fabric within 2 days. I just hope the rest doesn’t start doing the same
NEG 	Some of the chocolates fell out.
NEG 	They work. At first dogs dislike them, but ignore them soon after. No hiking is worth it.
NEG 	These run LARGE. I got one size smaller than I thought I needed, based on the measuring instructions in the ad. But they are still a bit large for my liking. Not insurmountable, but when I replace them, I will go two sizes smaller than the measurements indicate. They do a good job of protecting the hands during weight-lifting, both of free weights and machines. For the first several times I wore them, I noticed that my palms were black after I took them off. I have not washed them yet, so maybe that will help. The stain came off my hands relatively easily, I just don't like the thought of what my skin may be absorbing in the meanwhile. I got the hot pink and they are attractive.
NEG 	I was reluctant to order because of the sizing. I typically wear a small or medium. Ordered a large due to sizing. It will work (and it’s gorgeous!) but it’s a tad roomier (I ordered an XL).
NEG 	These are great stretch workout shorts, they do run small. I should’ve ordered the extra large instead of the large
NEG 	setting up instructions were a little difficult, but once I got it installed I love it. I programmed one of the smart plugs for the master bedroom lights and it works great.Plug does what it says.
NEG 	This is an update, before I said it was a good product. It’s not the same thing happened to the replacement that happened to the first one. There is something wrong with the Bluetooth transmitters in these products. But the customer relation is great even though they won’t admit that something is wrong with their product. Update: I emailed the company and they emailed me back. The person I talked to is a really caring person. The customer relation part of this company is awesome. I would definitely buy from this company again. Just because I trust the people who represent the company.
NEG 	Scent is pretty overwhelming. Effectiveness is moderate at best. Bands are comfortable and fit adults and kids.
NEG 	I love Karen Rose. I have read all her books some i have absolutely loved others not quite so much. This is one of those. Characters were good but again not my favorite, I liked Sasha and her family a lot. Maybe I'll like it better after a reread.
NEG 	Works fine as a life jacket with a lot of pockets.
NEG 	Stronger than I thought so I have adapted the dosage for my needs. You will have to test it for yourself. To much puts me to sleep. I use it a lot at bedtime. Directions say to turn the top one way to open, but my bottle opens the other way. It took me 4 days trying to open the bottle until I tried the other way. I will probably purchase again.
NEG 	It was a gift. Great grandson probably busted it already!
NEG 	Very pretty dress, very long
NEG 	Have not installed them yet. I will in the next 30 days. Ask again later .
NEG 	Lead Couple were two Nerds that fell in love but took a long time to get together. Enjoyed the glimpse of there thoughts and motivations. It surprised me in several areas. Will be reading others in series.
NEG 	My husband has put them to the test and we just got them
NEG 	Quits sending in Florida summer heat. Once cooled off starts working again. Other than the heat problem it works fine when temps are moderated.
NEG 	This was my first Robert Crais novel and I read two more after it. Loved the introspection.
NEG 	Attractive, fast electric kettle, love the different temperature settings, but the "keep warm" light stopped working after a week. Not a huge deal as otherwise it still works great.
NEG 	These work great for one of my dogs. My other dog however is a Houdini and some how figured out how to unhook it from the car. After the park it works fantastic but before it’s about 50/50 with whether or not she’ll unhook it.
NEG 	Did it’s job, will use for a long time.
NEG 	Really good quality. And it really works.
NEG 	Nice book for Instant Pot. Easy-access and helpful recipes!
NEG 	What a wonderful set for the price. Well made. Durable.
NEG 	These are not the small vanity lights I thought they were. These are the same size bulb as your average home light fixture. They still worked great in my entryway chandelier.
NEG 	This product keeps my 6mth old baby occupied and engaged.
NEG 	This is okay but have learned eying it is much easier
NEG 	I have used this on my cat because the nubs are softer and do not hurt his skin and fur as much. It can remove fur easily and also can easily be pushed out for easy disposable. The tool works most of the time and has a nice grip to it.
NEG 	The holster cracked in the weakest point.
NEG 	I loved this case. The stand broke yesterday though and it's kinda sad. It was perfect. Kids are rough..
NEG 	So far so good. I have not had a problem connecting my phone to the speaker. I received the speaker on the 14th. Today is the 19th and the first time I had to charge the speaker since the original charge. I have been using every day for about 8 hrs. a day while painting. I'm very surprised about the sound quality that comes out of it. I like the fact I can move from room to room with it and not have to worry about plugging it in to an outlet.
NEG 	I love the scent and it's very soothing, but it does seem to fade quickly.
NEG 	I really like that you can turn the head of the brush. It makes it so much easier to brush my babies. My kids have 2 different kinds of hair, one has straight and one has curley q's.
NEG 	Worked perfect for fixing my non working pressure washer!
NEG 	Like for our homeless packs
NEG 	The battery fit the drill and charger very well, and held charge as the original,
NEG 	Amazing product for working hands
NEG 	I did order up since I wanted the loose fit. It’s thin, like a T-shirt, wasn’t sure what to expect, but not meant to be worn solo in this weather.
NEG 	With this being my first PAK figure, as well as my first posable figure. It's pretty good except for one thing, the right ankle joint is loose. Causing him to have a hard time standing up on his own, other than that it's good. The details are nice, especially on the wing. You are going to need some room if you're going to pose him with the sword because the sword is about 14in long. The joints are not that obvious unless you view it up close, unlike some other figures that I've seen. All in all it's a good figure, even though I have to play around with weight distribution when posing him.
NEG 	Very good product and well priced. Looks good and gets the job done.
NEG 	Size fits god. Very comfortable. Reduced swelling in coast to coast flights.
NEG 	This was very easy to set up and has clear pictures. I will purchase again.
NEG 	What can I say - it's a glass pie dish which showed up unbroken -- even tho it was only in a shipping box with paper padding.
NEG 	So cute! A little difficult to get her in it but it’s worth how cute and protected she is!
NEG 	I've gotten some pretty good use out of these they are worth the money. They look good too.
NEG 	Perfect size for my long hair chihuahua. At first she seemed to not like it, but after introducing it slowing and mixing with her other food, and gradually decreased the old and more of the new, she's now on all Royal Canin. She likes it now, and I'm happy with it.
NEG 	It is really nice and does what it is suppose to. The only problem is that the arms that go under the mattress do not stay put or attach anywhere so when you try and hide away and re-pull out.
NEG 	Needs about 1 inch more space in between shelves. No way I'm actually getting 166 bottles in this guy.....but it's quiet, looks good and I'm essentially happy.
NEG 	I should have looked at the fabric (it's polyester) that makes this garment hold in body heat. very uncomfortable for me. But this caftan is well made. It has nice stitching. maybe I will re-gift it.
NEG 	Gorgeous on my black cat. I'm only going to put it on her for special occasions though...because the "velvet/suede" is already starting to tear and she's only worn it twice.
NEG 	good earbuds...wish they didn't fall off when doing sit ups though.....
NEG 	For the price you cant really beat it. Its taller then the ones in wallyworld. I would have given it a 5 star but it's a little flimsy. I would recommend.
NEG 	They work well but they are just a little too long/large.
NEG 	Surprisingly perfect size for two six month rabbits. But the top part does NOT fit with the bottom litter pan - there is a loose gap in between which is okay for rabbit litter which is paper-ish, but I can see why it’s not good for cat litter sand
NEG 	This is my favorite mint gum of all time. Flavor stays long and strong. Kind of pricey though.
NEG 	The plot was average but very topical with the current opioid abuse, not as much action as in previous Reacher adventures. It takes along time to build up speed and characters could have been more thoroughly described.
NEG 	Couldn't wait to start the next one. Twists and turns. Great characters. Well developed. Thankfully there is more since I dressed finishing the book.
NEG 	I like the feel of this gel.
NEG 	Worked, instructions sucked
NEG 	So far we really like this attenna and it works well.
NEG 	I like the simplicity and sleek, sophisticated look of the watch. However, the lack of features compared to other watches makes it just okay
NEG 	I enjoyed this book very much. It is full of violence. A little self sacrifice and lots of love. But what else do you need?
NEG 	It works every bit as advertised... I just wish It came with a larger bowl to enjoy a bit more coffee...
NEG 	Great game! But I wish it came in a game box, the game is in a plastic bag in a shipping box but there is no actual game box. The game did work well and we had fun playing.
NEG 	I had to purchase $5.00 gifts for some outdoor enthusiasts. I took a chance on these since two came in the package. The young men who received them seemed to be very interested in them and actually put them on right away. It became a group discussion as they looked for all the features and felt it was well worth the price.
NEG 	I purchased these for my three-year-old twin daughters who just got their ears pierced, because I like the idea of the screw back. However, the post is just barely long enough to make it through the ear lobes, and so the backs are constantly falling off because there’s pressure on them. They seem good quality and nicely made, just not long enough for that purpose. These are probably better for cartilage or other piercing areas.
NEG 	Very handy, but quite tricky to get the hang of. It takes a lot of practice to not pull the lib back off when removing the vacuum cap.
NEG 	Earphones could be a little bigger (since I have big ears, and one size doesn't fit all). Battery life is good but not great. Installation is a little confusing, if you're not a techie. But I got it done, and I love the sound quality.
NEG 	Well made, sturdy, cute, easy to clean. Besides a bit cheaper, what more could you ask for?
NEG 	Very nice design. Colors are vibrant! Runs small. You should order a size or two bigger then you need.
NEG 	Still need to be perfected. I couldn't finish the second robot.
NEG 	The traps works and usually does not injure the mouse. Occasionally however the mouse does lose part of its tail as the door slams shut. But the mouse seems to be OK even in that case. The big issue for me is cleaning the trap of mouse droppings. In the end I did a simple modification to make the trap easy to disassemble. Disassembled it become easy to clean. I don't understand why the manufacturer did not change the design so that it could be more easily cleaned right out of the box.
NEG 	I really like the metallic soft colors. Some of them tend to break if they are sharpened too much.
NEG 	I have purchased several brands of backup batteries. I like this one. Pros - lightweight, convenient size, stays charged. Cons - sometimes charges slow. This may from using 1A port instead of 2A port, but when plugging a dying phone in quickly, it's easy to use the wrong port. I would buy again.
NEG 	I didn't really pay attention as I should have and the edging was shorter than I expected, but it functions well on our planter areas to hold back the mulch and create an edge to weed whack against. One note, if you have more flowing edges (i.e., not straight) then they don't really provide enough stakes. We managed, but if they allowed you to purchase extra stakes that would be helpful where you're trying to create curves.
NEG 	Looking good so far but only had hard rain a couple of times since I installed it.
NEG 	more than expected sticks with no stuff on em. gonna try another brand(?) for next time but, in general... ok.
NEG 	The Amazon description is incorrect - it does not have a rubber sole. It is however super comfy and will serve as another one of my daily beaters. It’s not as comfy as the Boosts (or Bounces), but it’s not noticeable unless you’re directly comparing the two!
NEG 	They arrived on time. I had printed cards to insert based on the dimensions given and when they arrived I realized the dimensions were the exterior not the interior of the badge holder. I had to redo the badges.
NEG 	Size is small and it is easy to install. Bluetooth connected immediately and charger works. Happy about the design and sound quality.
NEG 	Very moisturizing. Great for dry skin. I have reordered.
NEG 	Pretty good product for the price. Will come out handy to play DVDs and CDs from the library during the road trip as well as at home.
NEG 	Granted the board and box are a bit cheap for the price but not that bad. The only problem I did have was that the pieces would not slide at first until I furniture polished the board. The pieces themselves are nice and as far as I'm concerned, I was able to swipe up a decent checkers set for only $7.
NEG 	Love having all the sizes in the set. A few won't stay in their spots in the case when closing it which is kind of a pain. Otherwise a good set at a good price.
NEG 	Beware- this is very spicy! But good and easy to make.
NEG 	I really like it but she toppled over once and her leg broke when she fell less than 6 inches
NEG 	My husband is trying this to help bring up his platelet count. He said it is pretty good but is bitter. Just added a little honey to sweeten up.
NEG 	Arrived on time and in excellent shape. I appreciate all the info Swiss Army Knife has available to buyers because I had no idea how many different combos of tools there are! Had no trouble selecting a Father’s Day gift for my husband - noticed he hadn’t carried a knife for a while and this one is perfect. I’d give a 5 but I’ll save it for next time.
NEG 	Loved this story. This story is about Genevieve and Barrett. Genevieve bought a house to restore, Barrett Cooper was who was hired to do the work for her. Barrett knew she was the one the minute he saw her. Once they get together they are together all the time. These two are amazing together. Great quick read.
NEG 	I like these little things because they're small and cute and I work in vineyards so it feels personal but they aren't perfect. if you stick the bottom point into the crease of the book hoping that it will sort of wedge itself in there and stand upright it just falls over. basically the rubber is a little too thick so it doesn't tightly wedge in there but I mean it's a place holder so it is what it is. I'd recommend them.
NEG 	Sign is well made and nicely finished. Now let's hope unwanted solicitors will actually take the time to read it.
NEG 	Pretty nice. Dogs like it but it could have more filling in it. It could be softer and more padded. It’s pretty warm though.
NEG 	I receive my silly Express face paint kit but did not receive the stencils with it I messaged the seller on Amazon but haven't heard back from them yet I requested that they send the stencils to me separately so let's hope that I received them if they do I will change my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars and edit the actual review but other than that the face paint set is great the paints themselves go on smooth and do not cause any allergic reaction my kids have super sensitive skin and this didn't affect them at all not one single bump! I was really hoping to get the stencils because that was the whole reason I bought this set!
NEG 	It opened and immediately smelt moth balls. took two days out Side and a bottle of febreeze.
NEG 	As usual Carl Sagan in full of great insight.
NEG 	Love this little purse, just right. Just what I wanted.
NEG 	I purchased this item off Woot.com for $50, then it was on Amazon for $25 a week later so I purchased this one and returned the other to woot! Not worth $50, but $25 is reasonable. There are a variety of sounds, the white noise options are weird though. I only use the first two, not the other eight because they have such strange increasing pitch, they are too irritating. I like all the different fan sounds, #3 is my favorite. This is going to sound crazy but every once in a while when I’m on the edge of falling asleep, I start to hear a crowd cheering and applauding, almost like a concert. It sounds distant, but EXTREMELY distinct. Sometimes I wonder if the employee that put this thing together overlaid part of a concert recording for 20 seconds of each loop or something, it blows my mind every time. This works great though and it gets very loud! Perfect upgrade from my 9 year old fan!
NEG 	Good quality, only a few unwrapped pieces (which happens even with small bags)
NEG 	This is awesome, love it so much better than the plastic ones. Much more pliable
NEG 	lovely work very inexpensive
NEG 	Lock is very nice. Instructions are vague on how many batteries are required in the lock. I tried to operate Ed with only 2, since that was the only battery compartment visible. Turns out one needs to pull the battery box from the lock to access a second battery compartment.
NEG 	I really like this and liked the idea of it having handles but they are a little too tall for my Cuisinart cooker which is why I'm giving it 4/5 stars. I still use it frequently though.
NEG 	Nice grips, replaced the OEM grips on my Santa Cruz with these. They have held up half a season so far without any tearing or slipping.
NEG 	I am 5'6", 170lbs, 34DD and ordered the Large. This is my first time ever wearing something that doesn't have a ton of support for the girls but I gotta say I like it! The dress is super flowy, it's a bit loose on the top but I assume that's because of the style. It's literally held up by two strings so its gonna be loose. My biggest complaint is that the little under skirt rides up as soon as you move and creates this little bunching in the back of the dress. It'll be annoying to keep adjusting it but that's not too bad.
NEG 	The last good madden game I played was on the PS3 lol last few years Madden just seemed bland and had no fun to it. I though what the heck, I’ll give it another chance and bought it. The pre-order was confusing because it never gave me a shipping/arrive date. I canceled that order and bought it the day it came out and got in today. Been playing for a few hours and it’s definitely my favorite Madden I’ve played in a long time.
NEG 	I didn't want an instapot, I just wanted a good rice cooker/steamer. I'm hoping this one will last longer than the last one. This is great for cooking long grain rice (which I'm terrible at on the stovetop). I have several rice recipes that this product helps me cook to perfection and steaming tamales.
NEG 	Right size, no holes. Fits snugly. Overall great product
NEG 	I love how comfortable the handle is and the ring to hang the included bag holder, which is why I chose this leash. Another plus is we can be seen at night. I hate the smell!!! It will pass. Leash looks great. I gave 4 stars because of the smell.
NEG 	Fun book even when your kid uses vomit or poop for prettt much ever word.
NEG 	I fell in love with these when I saw them and bought two. They are a lot smaller then I thought they were going to be when I bought them. They are still adorable and I have them on the nightstands of my guest room.
NEG 	I ordered two only one has arrived so far
NEG 	Small size and prints as expected n
NEG 	It works Ok and gets the job done. I guess I was hoping for a little sturdier, but for the price it is a good value.
NEG 	My dog loves the chew bone. She prefers the corn starch refills, but unable to find them anywhere.
NEG 	I like the size of bottles because they are easy to store, and I’m new to making stuff so it’s helpful to find which ones work for me!
NEG 	I loved most the characters and their various lives and stories. A very quick read which I enjoyed a lot. I will recommend this book to others
NEG 	Love the air bed but it doesn’t hold up through the night. Very comfortable when first blown up but then through the night it’s going down and I only used it three to four times. I’m not sure why it does that.

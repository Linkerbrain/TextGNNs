1	Arrived broken. Manufacturer defect. Two of the legs of the base were not completely formed, so there was no way to insert the casters. I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process.
1	the cabinet dot were all detached from backing... got me
1	I received my first order of this product and it was broke so I ordered it again. The second one was broke in more places than the first. I can't blame the shipping process as it's shrink wrapped and boxed.
1	This product is a piece of shit. Do not buy. Doesn't work, and then I try to call for customer support, it won't take my number. Fucking rip off!
1	went through 3 in one day doesn't fit correct and couldn't get bubbles out (better without)
1	Poor quality. The material was fuzzy from day one. It got discolored in less than a month, even though we kept it outdoors under a covered porch. I returned this item.
1	Ordered 2 they shipped 1 promised by certain day, then the next day, then the next day.
1	Followed directions, did not work as advertised.
1	There is a terribly done band across the top. Supposed to keep the shirt on your shoulders but seems more of like a waistband.
1	Unless you have this jam-packed full of items, the unit collapses on itself. I never held it's shape therefore, making it hard to reach my items when I needed them. The silver metal pieces on the handle fell off soon after it arrived. I must have missed the "return by" date as I now am stuck with it.
1	I am disappointed in this purchase. I bought one of these in another color and in size XL and it fit great. This one I bought in white in XL and it fits like a Medium. I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.
1	It doesn’t work after less than a month. The contacts on the connection are cheap. Don’t waste your money.
1	was not pleased and Bluetooth malfunctioned after a couple of weeks
1	Followed instructions, and never caught a mosquito.
1	Absolutely horrible. Fingerprints, face prints, smudgy and impossible to use in sunlight! Literally cannot see screen. Want my money back, and going to go find the one i used before!
1	Does not play with with the two cases i bought. I'd request a refund but mines already cracked from the cases.
1	Doesn’t work and tried contacting via email based off of the card that came with the item. Email does not work.
1	Beautiful way. Does not stay paired with or connected to my daughter’s iPhone. Essentially useless other that to tell time.
1	Stems were broken due to poor packing. Shapes are way different from the pictures. Blemishes in the skin.
1	Buy one size smaller, they r BIG
1	I had problem with the 2 screen protectors, any of them paste well on the screen. Very disappointing because I also bought the complete screen protection and I hope not happening the same thing...
1	The product was faulty and seller offered refund and asked that I take down my previous bad review. It's been 2 weeks and I still haven't seen a refund. The diffuser worked fine for about a month (long enough to be out of the return policy) then stopped. Not worth the $40
1	Do not bother buying these toys. Didn’t even last 1 day.
1	I never got my item even though it said delivered.
1	I used to have a much used & well loved OXO cookie scoop that was lost in our last move. I bought another in October and took it out today to use for my Christmas baking. It fell apart like other reviewers have complained on the third cookie. I'm very disappointed with the quality of the new product.
1	May update IF I ever receive this item! After 2 weeks...Received a notice saying the usps claimed it was undeliverable to this address... not like I haven’t received a thousand items here from Amazon and mail in general. Usps said they can’t even look into it since NO tracking number was provided. Not pleased.
1	Totally uncomfortable
1	Wrong size for my husband. I need to return them, unfortunately.
1	They start off working well but eventually the microphone stops working and the ear pieces electrocute you no matter the volume your phone is on.
1	Not 3 pieces just one sheet
1	Tom Clancy has company as the most uselessly over descriptive writer. Also I suspect the author is a virgin. Absolutely terrible.
1	I ordered this book on February 11. It never arrived.
1	We order two different types of jewelry from this company the other jewelry we order is perfect. However with this jewelry I have a few things I don't like. The little Stone comes out of these and customers are complaining and bringing them back and we are having to put new jewelry in their holes. You cannot sterilize these in an autoclave as well because it heats up too much and the glue does not hold up so the second group of these that we used I did not sterilize them that way and the stones still came out. When I use a dermal clamp to put the top on the stones come out immediately. DO not waste your money on this particular product buy the three mm. that has the claws that hold the jewelry in those are perfect. So now I'm stuck with jewelry that I can't sell not good for business.
1	The barbell pad is fine but the ankle strap is terrible. It does not hold well at all. I guess I’ll havw to return everything.
1	This product caused severe burning of my skin. I have used other brands with no problems
1	Only worked for about a month and now dead?
1	Absolutely cannot get lotion out of bottle... despite storing it upside down! I will have to throw out.f
1	It typically works for a few turns and then nothing comes out after that. I would shake it to try to get peppercorns to feed but that never really helped much. Only emptying it, clearing the neck and reloading it would get it working again for a few more turns. Seems like the neck is too narrow and gets clogged inside. I finally tossed it out because even the disposable McCormick pepper grinder works consistently without all the fuss.
1	this was a birthday present when she opened the box the glass was broke and the light bulb was hanging it is really cute but don't bother really not worth the hassel
1	Was not a kit, was only a small individual box of lipstick.
1	The wicker baskets all unravel. Cheaply made. I reached out for replacements and heard nothing back. Going to send the whole thing back.
1	My best friend got this mattress before summer started and I've slept on it many times and I get the best sleep at her house. I asked for the mattress as a birthday present, I opened it on the 9th and as I was unrolling it i was starting to smell something musty but i thought it could be because it just traveled in a box for a few days. It's now the 12th and my ENTIRE BOTTOM FLOOR WREAKS OF SOME NASTY MUSTY SMELL. It smells like the bed is rotting. OH and the mattress I ordered is classified as a 6inch mattress but its measuring between 4 and 4 1/2 inches... 3 days later. Today is the first day I have done anything other than touch with my fingers or sniff. The bed feels very firm and if you sniff it you will want to gag. I've already filed through amazon that I'd like a replacement. I'm just puzzled how the mattresses could be so different. We both slept on her brand new, 6 inch, Zinus mattress less than 24 hours after she opened it but mine is like I picked it up off the side of the road. When I get the new mattress I'll edit my review accordingly.
1	This does not work for an iPhone 8.
1	If you are never going to wash your window or get dust on it maybe it won't scratch instantly... Little twigs hit it and it scratches.... Haven't been able to see out of it since the second ride I went on... JUNK
1	Terrible. Doesn’t even charge waste of my money.
1	This case initially looked great. It was clear and sturdy. Fast forward a few months and it has taken on an ugly brown discoloration. It isn't just that it's dirty. Its as though the thermoplastic has spoiled and reacted to the air. I'd return it if it was still within the return window but unfortunately I don't still have that option. Very disappointed.
1	My mom loves the mild compression of the knee high but says the top is too loose and falls down. She cannot wear them. I was after a looser top because the others cut into her leg and stop circulation. Any suggestions?
1	Globe Department Store is where money came from.I have used Pure Grace for 10 years and this bottle smells like rubbing alcohol. I'm taking it to a lab with my real bottle for analysis. this stuff smells totally fake.
1	Cheap all peeled off in less than a month
1	Junk. Won't hold a charge anymore. Should have purchased the actual Black & Decker brand. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for, etc. Buyer beware.
1	It’s used by many people wasn’t new at all Very stringy and stretch our hair was falling out of the wig
1	Would a great timer if it was waterproof. It would seem like something that is being used outdoors in most cases would be waterproof especially something controlling sprinklers. I had one growing season but failed a few weeks into the following season after the control shorted out after getting wet. It performed so well that I thought I would just try another and cover the control as best I could with a plastic bag. It failed after only a few months and for the same reason even after protection.
1	It was easy to use yes. But it didn’t hardly give any color. The color I had was very spotty! It took using over half of the bottle to even start to notice anything.
1	Leaked, the very first try
1	Seemed like a nice pen, but I couldn’t even get a decent line out of it. Disappointing.
1	Very difficult to clean.
1	After reading and watching the other reviews I decided to order this hair and I hate that I did. This hair is on the level of some low equality Beaty supply pack hair and to be honest I’ve had some better pack hair then this “ virgin hair”. I had a blunt cut straight bob and it kept flipping up like a kick stand. I li tried it curled and the curls dropped within a hour or so. These other reviewers are either lying, never had good quality hair or got a better batch than me. Idk!!LADIES ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK
1	is very tide and very uncomfortable
1	I like the looks of the clock; however, it is defective. I put in battery, but the clock does NOT work.
1	It charged and worked like a dream for about a week, then had some difficulty charging, and now will not charge at all, despite trying every fix found online. What a shame. Past the return window, of course.
1	Not a good product at all. The adhesion is nonexistent. Do not waste your money. I gave up on this product and used my old Note 4 tempered class. I was most definitely taken in by the hype.
1	Packing was horrible, they packed it in a bag. By the time I received it, it was crushed. I hope the film still works.
1	This stuff is whiter than any porcelain surface you will encounter, making it stick out like a sore thumb.
1	The thing doesnt even work
1	The battery life on the barrier transmitter is terrible. It’s plugged in more than its used to do its job and the transmitter isn’t functional when it’s plugged in. It’s a constant struggle to check and see what’s the status of the battery. In the mean time, the dog continues to eat couch cushions realizing his collar isn’t beeping today! Terrible waste of money.
1	It came with a broken clip to hold the legs .... I had to use a knife to shave the plastic on the legs to get it to slide to lick into place .... not to happy
1	I bought 2 of these and one of my golden retrievers chewed a big chunk off. I was contacted after leaving an instagram review and they told me there are fake companies out there making the product with silicone instead of rubber my dog is not a big chewer and easily chewed a piece off...thankfully spit it out before he swallowed any...so i'm out 26.00 because they both went in the garbage....dog owners please be careful.
1	The first time is very good, very handy, but more than two times on the water, is not very normal. I gave him credit. Deleted.
1	I received a flesh colored product when I had ordered the black.
1	Polishing filter defective. Contacted the company got no response .
1	This board could have been a perfect board for my son, but the stain does not come out from white board and the white board plastic (the materiel) started getting wrinkles. It is difficult to get any thing out of white board for adults, kids cannot remove it at all with the eraser or a cloth.
1	Waste of money or fake i tried so hard to fix even smallest scratch but no result.
1	It does not work. When i plugged in it shows the status light but it does not work. very disappointed with the purchase.
1	Unfortunately this product didn’t work at all for us. Firstly, it was too big for our small dog, even though the description says this was designed for small dogs. (We have a pug/french bulldog mix, so she’s on the thicker side of small.) We could have worked with the size, but it was pretty much broken from the get go. Not sure if we got a defective product, but after the batteries ran down once the receiver wouldn’t recharge. Either the charger or receiver was broken, maybe both. We couldn’t get the receiver to sync with the remote, every time we pressed the reset button as instructed the receiver wouldn’t beep, and it didn’t seem to be able to charge. This was kind of an expensive product and was highly reviewed, so we are pretty disappointed. We will be returning it.
1	This product didn’t come, and if it would have came it took about 3 months to come.
1	Smells terrible and washed out a lot of my color. Not happy with purchase
1	I just received it and the packaging had been opened and the soleplate cleaner was no where to be found. All I have are the cleaning cloths. Very disappointed in something that had such rave reviews!!!
1	I try my best to be positive about my purchases from Amazon but this one I cannot be. This tree is the most cheaply made poorly constructed tree I’ve ever purchased. And now I have to keep it because I have three kids ready to decorate their Christmas tree this evening. This tree looks like it is been constructed by elementary school children and put together with glue. I am very unhappy with this purchase it looks nothing like the picture! My poor kids are going to be so sad as our tree falls apart!
1	Swollen two days after installation. Calibrated fine but ruined the track pad.
1	Never received my product!!!
1	Almost every peach balloon popped after a few mins of inflating. The color is very nice. I wish it was durable.
1	Don’t purchase. They have no cushion.
1	Did not get the Pom poms. Just received the globes and then fan like decorations. Super disappointed
1	Very disappointed in Amazon for allowing this vendor to swap software without any forewarning. Read two other reviews with the same issue.
1	Burned my skin and box looked like It was used
1	The antenna just get signal for like two channels and the picture quality was poor.
1	This screen protector does not fit. Waste of money.
1	The watch has great features. My only concern was that the screen was to hard to see. You can actually see the watch face better in direct sunlight. Inside where i work i can hard see the screen
1	Great Product but as time passes gets worse.
1	Terrible product. Had it for a few weeks and dropped my phone and the screen shattered from top to bottom. It might protect a phone if it lands on a corner or side, but if the screen lands flush to the floor, it will not protect it. Also, the power button is hard to push and the back piece does not work very well as a kickstand. It’s too flimsy.
1	I’ve purchased and used this filter several times and have never had any issues-until recently. This last one I received has been horrible! I installed and made sure it was locked into place. Ran about a gallon of water through and the water smells! and tastes like dirt/chemical! The water however is crystal clear but just horrible. I’m so disappointed considering I drink water constantly and was relying on what I thought was a quality product that had been consistent until now.
1	They should have made the base more red this attracts very few hummingbirds compared to the red one I bought at the dollar store...
1	Bought for a gift. Wouldn't dare give it, as it looks and feels so cheap. Not at all like the one I saw on TV.
1	When i ordered this item i was expecting to receive 5 little boxes as pictured... Nope one little box! Not worth the price!!!
1	The roll came in a box marked grape jelly... in the the mail which stayed in my box for 2 days 90 degree wether... It was pre frozen. Which drives it out....not alot of pumpkin taste for which I dare tried it... but cheap...
1	Terrible! Don't waste your money. It's a jap knockoff of realtor and it totally sucks! Could connect to my router but after that no dice.... no web access! Brilliant scam, well done!
1	Cute but definitely for a small child. My 6 year old grand daughter didn't want it because it wasn't a real violin.... :(
1	The product worked for maybe five minutes then it stopped and my iPhone said is not compatible with iphone
1	Phone does not work when plugged in to an active land line - no dial tone. Seller asked for pictures.
1	I bought these bottles with the intention of mixing essential oils in them. The spray hardly works and they leak frequently. Would not recommend for use with essential oils.
1	Two nights in the water tide to our dock in the lake..... I’d say something liked this.
1	I bought a package of three. Two of them have already stopped working and it's only been about six months. The use has been minimal. We each used one on our nightstand, and I kept an extra one in the office. We never traveled with them, never took them out of the house, and they just stopped working for no apparent reason.
1	The mouse is very light and the cord weight ends up pulling it off the table, also the red hexagon pattern at the back of the mouse does not have any holes like in the picture, its a solid piece of plastic with shapes cut into it, but not holes. Also it claims to be RGB, but really, you cant change the colors at all. Feels cheap. Very very disappointed. Wish I could get my money back
1	I DID EVERY SINGLE THING THE INSTRUCTIONS SAID, AND THIS STILL LEFT ME WITH NO SHINE, SLIGHTLY LIGHTER HAIR, AND DRY ENDS. THIS ONE WAS NOT A WINNER!!!!!! PS MY HAIR IS PROFESSIONALLY HIGHLIGHTED EVERY 5 WEEKS. SHE HAD TO DO A CONDITIONING TREATMENT ON MY HAIR! FROM NOW ON, ONLY CLEAR SHINE AT THE SALON FOR ME!!!
1	Received disc opened and non-functioning
1	Bought these for my homemade candles. The wicks are thin and do not keep a flame or burn out completely. Going to try doubling or tripling up and soaking in oil so they dnt go completely to waste.
1	It was too small for my headphones.
1	I was gently drying with a paper towel the residual water off of it, and the glass shattered. Only a bit over a month and using it sporadically. Too fragile !!! I wish it would come with a replacement. Aesthetically is beautiful but it’s not durable. I do not recommend.
1	This thing is a joke. 1. It doesn't provide warm steam. Am I wrong to assume steam is usually warm? This thing is a mister NOT A STEAMER. 2. It turns on for 3-5 seconds and then turns off. You have to shake it to get it to work again. 3. Instructions are in a foreign language.
1	These are whole teeth. They are not hollow. If you are missing a tooth these may be for you if you can get a proper adhesive!!!
1	This camera is a piece of shit.... won't connect to Wi-Fi, instructions are not clear at all and not contact information for cs to get help. Fucking waste of time. Annoyed that Amazon had this a featured product. It doesn't deserve even 1 star
1	This Case is no good. It looks great in the advertised photos but once the case is on the actual phone it’s no good. Does not fit right, the rubber piece coming off the hard plastic piece. Not very confident of protection if dropped
1	Please send another one with all the items. I still need the product.
1	The product never actually arrived, despite the tracking saying it was delivered. After looking all over to find a way to contact customer service about this, and finding nothing, I finally just ordered another one. So if you want to pay twice for something, then by all means, buy this.
1	Doesnt work well. It's harder to use the screen. It's not even the same as advertised. What a waste of money.
1	Had 10 days to deliver still not here
1	Color is faded out. But when you take a picture it enhances the color for some inexplicable reason!!! Don't waste your money. When you want to return it you have to pay for shipping so to cut your losses you wind up taking their ridiculous settlement/discount and just keep it. Then use it as a shower liner. What a scam! Beware of Amazon third party sellers and don't deal with this one.
1	These are the worst quality mats- we bought (2) for our house and neither mat is properly aligned. The edges are awfully cut and uneven.
1	When this mower arrived, I was delighted with its design and light weight. However, after a months use, the handle began to require constant tightening and attention. Eventually, the plastic adjustable handles wore out and I had to use wire to clamp the two sections together. Towards the end of the mowing season, the motor stopped working, apparently burned out. I have owned other corded electric mowers, including B&D and was impressed. However, this mower has driven me back to a gas-powered unit.
1	I had high hopes, but ... the products has a seriously unpleasant taste and aftertaste. The consistency isn't bad ... so glad I only bought 1 small bag.
1	First drop and it shattered. Had it on only 24 hours. A real shame because I was enjoying it until it broke.
1	Mozart is not in dispute. He and his life were rare supremacy. Unfortunately, the direction and camera work of this film is insulting to Mozart.
1	There’s where holes in almost a quarter of the silver ones I’m so disappointed I had to find a party city around me smh
1	They stopped working in 1 month. I am very disappointed.
1	Arrived and smelled terrible! I didn’t want to put any of my clothing in them so I put them in the washing machine on delicate/hand wash and this happened! Horrible quality such a disappointment and a huge waste of money.
1	I was so disappointed in this product. I was excited with it's functionality of the screen and a different color than black, along with the choices of colors of the keyboard. Unfortunately it's not as responsive as my fingers and misses words / letters and then it randomly adds periods and adds spaces. So frustrating. I didn't use it before I went out of town so I was stuck with it for a few days, drove me crazy!
1	returned . it would not recognize internet . standing next to netgear router says internet not available . tried for several hours and finally gave up . reset many times .
1	Love the feel of the sheet set but very disappointed in the cooling effect that your website describe. It is not at all cooling when sleeping. In fact tit gets really warm and still waking up sweating. This purchase was completely unsatisfied. I washed it so I have to keep it. I am very disappointed in this product.
1	My order history says I received this but I never did!! Was gonna order it but then realized I already did, but never got it. Where do I get this fixed!?
1	Very disappointed. Did not work with my black and decker blender as stated. When I used it, my blender started smoking. When I investigated the issue I realized that the rubber around blade had shredded and melted! I did not want to give it ANY stars. do not waste your money!
1	I really liked these sheets at first but after a few months they are shredded. They came apart and now have 18” holes in them. I definitely will not buy again!
1	returned. very cheap looking.
1	Extremely slow,couldn’t even use my Facebook app,after three days,I didn’t even Drop it,not once,it didn’t want to charge anymore,I put it for over eight hours,I recommend getting a Samsung or Apple tablet,don’t waste your time,even the refund is taking a long time to get,because it’s an Amazon product,I’m just extremely angry.
1	Easy to hold. Use it twice with perfect results. Two weeks later, it doesn't work at all. No idea what changed.
1	First of all, the color is definitely baby pink, not the taupe-ish dusty rose color that is pictured. Second, I would never consider this a wrap dress, I would say it’s a glorified kimono. Third, it’s completely see through and fourth, the boob area was way too baggy so unless you’re EXTRA blessed in the chest department this might just look like a saggy cheap robe. In spite of the high hopes I had for this “dress”, I’d have to say it’s a big thumbs down for me unfortunately.
1	Small and not very bright. We bought two sets and the driveway isn’t lit sufficiently at night. One light didn’t work. Won’t order again.
1	DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. NO SOUND COMES OUT OF BOTH HEADPHONE JACKS. ONLY ONE AT A TIME!
1	PAY FOR 2 GET 1. GO ELSEWHERE AS IT IS A RIP OFF.
1	I purchased 2 bookmarks and received them yesterday. Both screens don't work. I was about to return one, but now the other one said it is ineligible for a return/replacement. Not impressed.
1	My product says it was delivered, but, never was... Paid for something I never received, I even called, nothing has been done.
1	Just couldn't, force myself to finish this book.....I have never had this happen to me before.
1	I never got my stuff
1	the pump does not spin, only turns 270 degree s
1	Sound is distorted. Look elsewhere.
1	battery does not hold a charge as it should, have to recharge before each use, then slows down before finishing use.
1	I would not buy this if you want a good screen protector go somewhere else
1	Complete waste of money and false advertising. On the pictures it seems like it would taste good but when you get the product it is clearly not right. Do not buy this for your kids or yourself.
1	Big gaps around my side mirrors. Tap did not stick to my car or the product.
1	This app does not provide you with YouTube Kids videos.
1	Looks cheap. He didnt care of course. He liked it. But I prefer to wear things that look and feel of quality. It also runs large. Overall, waste of $$
1	The adhesive is only on the edges. Didn't stick all the way and was trapping dust. Also quite smudgey - I was always wiping the screen
1	You may or may not get a good batch. I thought it was my desktop, maybe program out of date. Not the case, I installed software on laptop same issue, ran updates, same issues. Went back to desktop, no difference. Some work some don’t, it has to do with the discs. Not worth buying. It’s not any of my hardware or software. I have made many copies of discs from cd’s to dvd’s. Have not come across this in the past.
1	If you’re a mobile detailer don’t waste your money on this foam gun , stopped foaming after 1 week , I had a better one which I already had but that one failed of me after a year and half of use just got this cause i thought it would last. Disappointed also the suction tube cracks very easily
1	This thing lasted about a week and broke in 3 different spots. These are junk do not buy!!!
1	We generally like Aden and Anais products, but this fitted sheet doesn’t seem so fitted. I’m actually concerned it’s so loose that’s its unsafe. Defective or are they all like this?
1	Was very disappointed it only lasted 1 week. The threads are horrible I connected a intex hose that came with a intex sand filter and the hose came straight off. The threads should of hold.
1	This is awful. It has good ingredients but really affected my eyes. My contacts felt blurry after a couple hours and I had to take them out as soon as I got home from work. I immediately wiped the eyeliner off with my makeup remover and my eyelids were so puffy the rest of the night and the next day. So disappointed because the color was a perfect black and seemed like it would stay on all day, but can't wear it again.
1	I received this order right before leaving for a long camping trip. It was missing the plug to close it. I contacted amazon. They could not help me with getting the missing piece, so I tried to contact the seller. They never responded to me.
1	After less than a month of wearing these, my kiddo has worn the tread down a ton & the sole is ripping off completely. I know these aren’t the most expensive of shoes, but I was planning on getting more than 3 weeks wear out of them.
1	Seller didn't deliver. Should have checked the sellers rating before purchasing, but I didn't. Amazons A to Z guarantee refunded my money!
1	Very poorly packaged and handled during shipping. One of the packs of coffee had busted open and was all over everything in this shipment.
1	No idea what happened with this order. Ordered two phones, on separate orders. Order and payment went through, and delivery date was given. On the day they were supposed to arrive, I got notification that the order was cancelled due to "damage to package". No idea, but wasted four days waiting for phones that never arrived. No communication asking about reshipping them, so it just sounded fishy all the way around.
1	Only 9 figurines arrived and 1 was broken.
1	The charger immediately didn’t work after unboxing it. It would only charge in certain positions.
1	It didn’t make it a year. Not sure if the sun broke down the material or what, but it tore by the strap after a couple month. Then we had some wind and they cover tore right in half. Ugh
1	Worthless---Am going elsewhere to buy one that works. no Threaded screw in ends for urn No phone # or contact #
1	Very cheap material, ripped almost instantly when wearing and putting hands in pocket. Would not recommend.
1	Did not work on my 15 watt solar charger mounted on my step van did not send back it cost $8 what the hell I'm a little disappointed solar charger works fine on my battery without the limiter
1	Broke an front of case came off often.
1	this item did not arrive on time. When I requested return, no immediate response. Once I receive the return label, the words on the label are very small. Overall the customer service is poor
1	I’ve been trying to curl my hair for hours and can not get it to do anything. The included instructions seem like someone put them in to google translate. I’m going to find more YouTube videos, but so far I’m totally bummed.
1	Price is expensive and very hard to use and also doesn’t even work. Don’t bother buying this a waste of money
1	I love Amazon & for the first time I am so disappointed with the item I received. The size is nothing compared to the pic & the color is way way pale. The piece I received has only a slim strip of amethyst down the middle of the rough outter stone & the color couldn't be lighter. I don't know how to return it.
1	I got this when I was a lot newer to crafting and it seemed like the roller would be a big help especially since most of the crafts I was doing were mod podge based. I opted to buy this here because it was cheaper than at the crafting stores like Michaels but regrettably paying any price for this was a waste. The roller does practically nothing. There's very little weight to it so it doesn't really give you much pressure other than your own when using and when you try to use it to spread mod podge it doesn't, it moves right over it or if you try to smooth something like paper after you've applied it nothing happens either. I've saved the rubber squeegee as I use that when handling some vinyl projects.
1	Didn’t receive what item from the picture & wasn’t able to charge more listen to music at the same time
1	Product damaged (chipped glass) when washing on top dishwasher shelf after only a few weeks. Inferior materials and product. I am very displeased with the quality of this item. This happened to several items in our set so not a “one off” defect.
1	Return in progress as item was not the advertised size. Fell at least 6 inches short in width.
1	Two in package, arrived on time. Neither one works.
1	I bought these as a gift and was sadly disappointed when they arrived. They were basically cheap plastic and looked the same. I returned them and bought a thicker glass made product.
1	Don’t Buy, not worth it.
1	Poorly made. Looks really cut in the picture but the padding is weird and the poor excuse for underwire was already coming out when I opened the box. You get what you pay for with this one.
1	This is made from cheap materials -- think styrofoam egg carton material. If you took it to the park, it could blow away. This should go for 24.99 and even then I bet they would be making a killing. Also, the pattern could be more fun or more vivid. I would get something else if I were to do it again. Let's see if it lasts the year.
1	Neither of my birds are the least bit interested in this toy, not once have they paid any attention to it.
1	Didn't get a thorn poking through, but the valve stem is made very weak - it cracked off where it attaches to the tube in less than 6 months of use. I will not buy this brand again.
1	Look awesome and help your wheelies a lot, when the tires stay on! I read the reviews about losing tires very easily so I glued them before I even installed them on my Stampede. Lost one a week later. For $20 it is a waste. Save your money for a better upgrade.
1	Mouse wheel already having issue. When I scroll up it scrolls down for a second sometimes an vice versa.
1	Didn’t work for my 16 months old baby. He still sucks his thumb even if I just put a few coats on his nail. Sad.
1	30% of the cups were stuck to each other and impossible to separate. Had friends and family try to pull them apart and no one was able to. Tried heat, tried cold - nothing worked. Extremely disappointed. The picture shows a stack of cups that comes apart and one that does not
1	Not what I anticipated. It's bulky and heavy. It doesn't recharge my phone it just maintains the level I plug it up in.
1	This product arrived with a bent pole and two missing rollers and not instructions to assemble. I promptly returned the item and went to a local store to purchase.
1	This company Home Online third party seller refuses to give your money back when a package is lost or missing. They are no help and dont care for the customer happiness.
1	I was very disappointed with the number of areas skipped during the cleaning. Pictures not picked up off the table so the entire table could be polished. Missed under the center of the dining room table. Vanity tray not cleaned. I would have stopped them from leaving if I would have noticed while they were there.
1	They didn’t last long before flickering on and off
1	Product charged fully, literally, two times and has not gone past one light since.
1	Horrible quality not safe for pets
1	Gave less than 10 of these treats to my 15 week old puppy, and she had diarrhea for a day and a half. We had to change her normal food just to get her to have solid poops again. I would double check the ingredients with your vet before use because it’s safe to say we have stopped feeding her these. I was really excited to try these treats as they weren’t too high in calorie compared to other training treats. The package came as pictured, but the treats were bigger than I thought they’d be. They smelled tasty and flavorful, so I’m sad they didn’t work out for our girl.
1	Only lasted a month before refusing to reconnect even after resetting. The instructions and set up website have poor grammar; I think this is a cheap Chinese knockoff-esque type of product.
1	I ordered a size down since I like the bands to feel snug and secure, but it was wayyyy too big. I cant even wear them because they slide down or roll up. Its unfortunate because I was so excited to order them! The material on the band also is not sticky enough to adhere to the pants. Wish I would've returned when I had the chance.
1	Good heavens. Is this a money-laundering scheme? How dare anyone make a movie this bad? Ham-fisted acting, amateur camera work, an insulting musical score consisting of the same repeated ood scary phrase.. A chimpanzee could have written better dialogue. Don't waste you time.
1	They worked great for the first 30 days... then died and wouldn’t even turn on. Was literally 1 day outside of the return window. When they did work, they sounded great.
1	Installed 6 months ago. Now, when in USB/iPod source, automatically Error 19. This is without anything in the USB input. Tried all fixes and solutions. 6 months for $100.00 is not worth it to me. Wish I had stayed away from this unit.
1	I bought the dress in a size medium, but it was way too big. The waist needed to be taken in a few inches. If it was smaller in the waist area, I think it would have had a more flattering appearance.
1	When the battery arrived put in laptop and it did not charge. It would not even light up laptop. This is the first item from Amazon that was not any good. Wanted to exchange for a good one but was told sending a refund.
1	Thia style of tap is garbage. These have failed every single time i ve used them, even after using pliers to seat tap and tape to hold the assembly together. They damage the supply wire terribly, often leaving only 3 or 4 strands unbroken. Do not buy these. Watch a few youtube videos on splice taps if you feel you need to run power from an existing component feed.
1	It doesn’t fit tight into the outlet and will come unplug very easily, most of the time without me knowing right away.
1	Charges with no issue but will not record. Lights flash yellow and blue for 5 seconds and then shuts off. Computer recognizes the SD card that's in the pen when inserted into USB slot.
1	Product arrived late
1	Not a good replacement. Never fully charges no matter how long I let it charge, and only lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.
1	Engine does not shoot. Faulty piece. Boxes it and procrastinated the return, but Amazon blocked the return. This sucks!!
1	No directions. Looked around online and found the site they had directions but were very unclear. Once I figured it out I realized the auger does not fit into the part it's supposed to fit into. Don't know how I'll be able to use it and sure wish I'd looked it over when I first got it because I"m pretty sure it's too late to return it.
1	The wrong angel showed up. The angel with a dog showed up when I ordered the cat one
1	Receive dead empty overpriced lighter!
1	Wasn’t even the product described in description! This was my second time ordering the same item and it wasn’t right this time either. Save your time and buy somewhere else
1	I never ordered this nor received this.
1	Super disappointed that i ordered and never receive this product, had to end up canceling because it took over 3 weeks to even be shipped. Wont buy again from this vendor.
1	Came with no wrapping or protection of ANY kind, now dented and came apart! This has never happened before.
1	I will be sending this item back. I bought the 2XL after reading reviews and the cups on the top are smaller than a training bra and I can’t get the top to clasps at all. I’m a 36 C and there is absolutely no way this would fit.
1	These kept falling apart, returned for full refund. The plastic handle reinforcements kept falling out before I could even get these together and into my shelves
1	Too wide for sedan seats. We can't even use it because it covers seat belt buckle. I thought about returning the 2 I bought but I didn't.
1	Newborn size is far too big to be a newborn size. I ordered size newborn but when it arrived the tag says 0-3 mo, and it’s much bigger than my other 0-3 month clothes, it’s closer to a 3-6 month onesie.
1	No need to review, Amazon sells the device, but some apps they advertise will not work. What good is a product Amazon if it's only good for what Amazon sponsors at additional costs of course. Good advice don't buy an Amazon Fire Tablet, purchase a Kindle for your reading pleasure.
1	Never got the product. They offered a full refund for it.
1	iPad it’s perfectly in the case. Does not stay connected to iPad via Bluetooth have to keep reconnecting. Then the iPad makes a second connection for it. Have to keep turning off and back on to connect. It’s quite annoying. Regret this purchase.
1	I ordered these pillow cases and it would have been a great buy IF I would have received both of my pillowcases that it states it comes with!
1	Did not fit according to size. Too small.
1	Not sure why these are any different that the ones I buy at the store but my dog was able to chew the entire thing down in one day but the ones from the store last months.
1	Fabric was pure polyester, not good for infants. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known.
1	Product did not work w/ iPhone 8 Plus
1	Does not stick!! Popped off my note 9 after a couple of days. I followed the installation instructions. I wish I would have read other reviews before I wasted money on these.
1	Terrible. Not curved on sides. Does not adhere to edges. Doesn't work with cases due too non-curved sides. No way all these positive reviews are real purchasers of this product. Save your money.
1	Ordered a fan and received supplement pills.
1	Cheap made product! Bought to replace the newer nozzle on gas containers. One of the nozzles broke in half while pouring gas,luckily engine was cold. The second one the gasket failed. Find a different maker, made with cheap,thin plastic. Waste of money !
1	Not working with my computer. Will return. It is probably me. Will try one more computer.
1	Make sure to make sure your nail polish bottles will fit
1	Didn't even have this installed a month and the relay already failed. Was not exposed to moisture and somehow corroded causing my light bar to not work. Not too happy about it.
1	It's pretty difficult and the machine is complicated
1	I always use this product and love it. I’ve been ordering it for a long time. However, this most recent time I received two bottles and it was not the OGX conditioner in the bottle! Someone had clearly replaced it with a cheaper thick heavy conditioner, and I tried it in my hair and it was awful! It was so sticky and hard to wash out and my hair looked horrible afterwards. I had to throw it all away. Amazon sent me a replacement but it it’s concerning that this would happen. I’m not sure if I can ever trust ordering this from amazon again!
1	A pain in the a** to get the mounting brackets on and tight. And then still had to bend and pry the brackets to get the light bar to fit. Havent wired it up completely, I hope its atleast bright. So far sub par for the price. Light got moisture in the lens the first time it rained. Worthless
1	Very shallow. Advertises other things can be cleaned with it but reality is it’s way too shallow to fit anything in except phone. Had to take phone out of case. Disappointing. Wouldn’t waste your money on it. Would have been nice if glasses fit in it.
1	it is advertised to get rid of cigarette odors did not do what I needed still smells like smoke
1	It was basically a travel size and it did not mention this in the description. Way too tiny to use on a daily basis or even for traveling.
1	These worked for a few days, now whenever I try to use one my iPhone 6 says "accessory not supported"
1	This might be a good book if your in your 60s and above. It did nothing for my husband and I.
1	I ordered from Amazon because the only 5oz cups locally seem to be child oriented and not for an adult bathroom. Ha! My dixie cups have riddles on them and are as cartoonish as the ones I could have bought down the street. I'm throwing them out and getting a hard plastic cup. So mean to send something other than was pictured!!!
1	It is plastic . and it broke.
1	Very cheap looking. Thin pages and messy illustrations. Definitely not what I would choose to read to my class. Big disappointment.
1	Don't plan on ever taking these down. They will peel the paint from your walls and leave black adhesive.
1	Cheaply made would not buy
1	Hard to get to connect to charge
1	The grip bits are the hand portion of the glove we're falling off left and right. I'm not exactly sure why but it was probably after about 10 hours of use is when I really noticed it and began to slide my hands easier.
1	To short, material is hard.
1	Item wasn't delivered and no refund given
1	I bought this for the wireless charging capability. I was disappointed that when using wireless charging, it will charge for a few minutes and then it stops charging. You have to continuously check on it to make sure the charging has not shut off. I bought three of these. One for myself and two for gifts. Then I ordered a forth one for another gift. All four have a the same problem. I would not buy again.
1	If you buy one of these, be sure and get the one with the shatter proof insert. I got one with the glass insert which developed a crack after not more than a dozen uses!
1	These are easy to apply, but taking off the other side of the film is not. I put nails on at night and they already starting falling off the next afternoon. These aren’t for long time use
1	My remote just stopped moving. It will allow me to scroll thru but the dot never moves. Help!
1	Within a couple of weeks the center of the futon was sagging, and by the 2 month mark was completely flat in the middle, even with regular rotation. Could not sleep on it without rolling into the center. Worst futon mattress I've ever had, and no returns.
1	I took this as directed before getting a ride to the airport. I knew I would be in the back of the car on the drive. I started getting nauseous in the car (just like I usually do). Then on our flight, I got so overly nauseous to the point that I thought I was going to throw up. I know the exact symptoms -- first I start getting sweaty so I told my husband that I wasn't feeling well. I started to panic because I could see out of the window how high in the air we still were. He gave me a plastic bag just in case. I will never rely on this product again. While we were away, I went and bought the regular Dramamine that I had always relied on. It did the trick. I'm throwing this one that I got on Amazon in the garbage. I always love everything that I buy from Amazon so this is a definite first!
1	Shorted out my psu faulty on arrival. Smells like burning plastic
1	These will not stay on my son’s wall. They are currently falling off every time we turn around and will inevitably have to be thrown away.
1	Both batteries do not stay charged longer than a couple hours
1	I did not receive my item.
1	Item was never received
1	Stopped working after about a year. Slow wifi, did copious amount of troubleshooting to rectify the issue. All to no avail.
1	Nice product but does not have door hangers so we can't hang it.
1	Didn't work for me and I have dogs so I know that there was dog hair in there, lol.
1	I wish I could do half a star. I suffer from chronic neck and back pain and wanted to invest in something to relieve the pain. After reading on the different massagers, i settled on this one. My meds had worn off at 2am and the pain work me up. I decided to try the massager to get some relief until the next round of meds kicked in. I’m SUPER DISAPPOINTED! This worked for all of 30 seconds and then the nodes stopped working and the heat turned off. Seriously! Now stuck waiting in pain until meds kick in. I will be returning this item ASAP. Thanks for nothing!
1	I bought this set as a standby in case I ran out of ink. Unfortunately when I needed to replace them, the colored ink lights kept on blinking even after I made sure it was put in correctly. I was not able to print any of my documents.. This was he first tie I had problem with refilled ink.
1	Useless, basically its like a kazoo for your nose, does not alleviate snoring at all, if anything it made by nose feel sore the morning after, and is easily clogged if you have sinus issues.
1	Definitely buy the camera. Just the camera. Then get accessories that are worthy of the camera. Most of the accessories in this package are cheaply made and embarrassing to have been included the package. My mistake. Love the camera.
1	Fits too small and the material breaks easily
1	Difficult to get in and out of it. Too many handles and the zipper ids way smaller than the purse.
1	Only were able to use 3. The rest had holes in them.
1	Never received item.
1	Never received the product
1	DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It doesn't work at all. Missed the window to return it. Waste of Money. Junk
1	Didn’t like flavour and didn’t mix-up/dissolve well.
1	Received the old version of this “new and improved” shusher. I specifically bought this to get the version in grey that has raised buttons and a twist off bottom for ease in changing batteries and I received another one just like the one I had before. Very very misleading. Not happy at all. Now I have to take time out of my day and return an item that I thought was something else. i would order again but fear the same thing would happen.
1	The tire developed a crack after only 2 months of relatively light use.
1	All of the belts are very cute but once you start moving around while wearing them they come open and fall off. The links on the black belt completely fell off the belt. :(
2	Didn't work. The heating element was too small. We had better luck with a faux-fur heated blanket.
2	Love how this phone case looks and feels but it’s crap! Don’t buy it! It falls apart all the time. After time it stretches and makes it loose on the phone.
2	Leaks around the lid. If you care about leaks do not buy.
2	The shoes came in a timely manner. Looked really nice. But they were too small... I wear size 12 and ordered a size 12. The shoes were tight on the sides. The toe part was almost rubbing. The toe guard hit my pinky toe and rubbed... a friend of mine tired them on and they felt great to him. He wears a 10.5-11 so if you do buy them buy them a size bigger maybe you fair better...
2	Sent it back. Was disappointed. Did not like material and collar was weird and so was fit of belt and bust was lower than i expected.
2	It only lasted about 2 weeks before the post broke off the earring completely. I knew it was going to happen eventually, as it was delivered with the post already bent at a 45 degree angle and I had to bend it back, at which point I noticed the post was VERY brittle. So if you need this last minute for a cosplay at a con, its great. But don't expect to be able to wear it as a daily.
2	They open weird when you rip the seal off it doesn’t come completely off and they are bulky
2	They look nice but one arrived broken. I don’t want a refund I just want a replacement.
2	Unfortunately, this made my neck itch and returned it.
2	Didn't like the fact that I couldn't get my package on time
2	Ordered an 11, box says 11, got a size 10. They seem to be in great shape, but now my daughter cant wear these for her homecoming dance.
2	This product is very easy to install, but the glass is terrible quality. I had a small area begin cracking within the first 12 hours. Then on the third day after installing, there are four separate areas around the edges that are cracking/showing a spider web effect. The phone has not been dropped or mishandled since the screen protector was applied. Waste of money, will be buying a different product.
2	I was disappointed in this one. Recipes are mediocre. The book has lots of typos and no photos. It does have nutritional information which was nice.
2	Order a two sizes up. I ordered a medium and I normally wear a small..
2	Remote control doesn’t work most of the time. Very frustrating.
2	Stuff really stinks. Gets jell like so have to warm the bottle before using the dropper
2	The unit has a buzzing noise coming from the valve behind the LED cover. I have to assume this is a defective unit. How do I file a warranty claim?
2	I was sent the wrong size shirt ordered a medium and received a large
2	Hardware didn’t even fit. Had to use original screws. Not sure what the spacers are for. At some points on the mirror I see a double image which is throwing me off. Get what you pay for I guess
2	Plants were in bad shape when they arrived. I let them sit out for 48hrs before I tried to replant them, had over 50% mortality rate. Very disappointed.
2	I was very excited when I first got them! Then I held them up to the light and realized I could see through them completely. Then when I went to try them on, there was no stretch. If I stood completely still, they fit perfect, but I could walk in them without them moving down my hips.
2	I ordered this “extra-long” plant and the plant I received is anything BUT that. It’s possibly four inches long. The leaves were broken on arrival and it is not doing well at all. Buyer beware.........
2	I have used a few different screen doors (net curtain). This one was not super easy to install and didn't snap shut until i customised the set up. At which point it worked well. Although quite flimsy. I don't have much traffic in my home yet after 2 months one of the long magnets fell out.. (see photo) the fabric is just far too weak.
2	I bought it on the 15th and its already dead on the 21st.
2	The lid came broken. Not even temperature throughout.
2	Not enough paint for some colors, and they dry up easily. But it is fun.
2	Took out the watch and everything was fine but nothing on it is working, not the small hands i cant even change the date on it either. What am i supposed to do with a broken watch like that when nothing is functioning??
2	I've had this USB drive for about four months. I reformatted it to use for different data, and it only gave me 56 GB. Formatting again didn't help. Disappointed.
2	it came broken so am sending it back. I reordered but your packing lacks protection for the feet. Please please send the next one with better packaging. Otherwise, it will go back too if broken.
2	The product is so hard to set . I'm not even sure if it works . I will play more with it and find out . I'm good with many electronics except this one is the strangest .
2	Just received...... Where do we charge ? Nice device haven't used it yet.
2	I've used this brush consistently twice a week for one year. Quite suddenly, hairs are falling out of the brush every time I go to lather it on my face.
2	Restraining leash that is built in to hold pet in place will not shorten to length required. Dog was out of the seat and hanging by his harness before I got in the drivers seat.
2	Really pretty, just wish shipping didn’t take so long. Edit: These polishes didn’t last a month, they must’ve been old or just poor quality because they were so thick and gummy. I even tried thinning them out and it didn’t work so I just got rid of them. I recommend spending a little extra to get a reliable brand.
2	What I received was not fresh and there were a ton of yellow leaves.
2	Much smaller than I expected and the fur is slightly falling out.
2	in the picture it shows that it will come in a grayish black it came in a blue
2	I would put a sippie spout on the top lid. Its akward to have to have to undo the big top, drink then put it back. The tub also sweats a lot from condensation. Include a bottom with a sweat edge that will catch condensation in future models.
2	I can't finish these. They're just not very good in my opinion. Mileage always varies between folks with protein bars so maybe it's tastier for you.
2	I need to white out text at times and this product is not very good. I usually have to rub it on, then wait until it dries, then put on a second coat. Even after that I can still see the original text.
2	The app continues to crash and wont load games. Currently i have audio but no video. just a black screen.
2	Didn't notice much of a difference
2	These used to be the best wipes. But they changes them. We had a subscription and the last time they can the packaging was blue, like in some of the other new reviews. Checked the ingredients list to see if that had changes, and they had added a couple ingredients, but they were at the end so we figured we'd at least try it. Well, my baby has never had diaper rash... We give this new one a try and she cries when we wipe with them, and got diaper rash really bad by the end of the day. Horrible! So disappointed because we loved these wipes.. also pretty upset with Amazon for still advertising them as the old ones and randomly sending us these new ones :(
2	This book has a interesting storyline but I found this book about as much fun to read as a textbook. Reading it was like slogging through a bog - it just didn't flow. If lack of proper punctuation and misuse of words (their for they're, your for you're, etc.) annoys you, don't bother with this book. I did persist until the end because I wanted to see how it played out. Guess what? There is no end. Everything is left up in the air, nothing is resolved! Ugh!
2	The protection I think would be great on this case however you can't type very well with it. I guess if you needed to just have a waterproof case that didn't require to do anything but talk on the phone, this may be a good option. Was disappointed in the lack of quality in typing that could be done.
2	The item was just what I was looking for, petite and delicate.. Unfortunately after a couple days I'm my nose or started to swell, turn red and become warm to the touch. So I took it out of my nose and tried it in my cartilage. Again after a couple of days, the same thing. So I don't know what the material is because I've never had this problem with gold.
2	really large drops in the spray cannot be used for setting makeup just ok
2	this speaker sounds ok and is loud unlike other people have said. DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO CONNECT TO MULTIPLE DEVICES AT THE SAME TIME. this was a big disappointment to me as i use in my office for my tablet and my phone at the same time. When i have it attached to my tablet it keeps skipping songs on Pandora by itself as if the button is being pressed but doesn't on my phone.
2	Really hard to see while wearing.
2	The item does not match what is in the photo. The pin provided doesn't fit the hole that has the 1.25" square tubing(no the 1.25" Square Tubing does not run the whole length of the outside tubing.)
2	Does not hold the Galaxy S9 plus phone. The phone seems to be too heavy for the stick and causes it to rotate down when attempting to use the selfie mode. I tightened it and it still just rotated downwards. It's a shame as I was very excited when I unboxed it. The tripod seemed to work just fine, but I needed it to work in the selfie mode too.
2	This is unbelievably bright even on the lowest dimmest setting. It completely lights up the room! I am returning it since I was looking for a clock that you can read but won't light up the room.
2	Wack. Took forever to arrive and the puffy fur started falling all over my room after a few days.
2	This reader was hoping for incisive analysis from a former Secretary of State. Instead this is a sentimental reminisce of well known events in the long civil rights struggle. I don't know if it was ghost written. There is nothing sparkling in the style and nothing revelatory about the events described.
2	The product works well, the problem is the failure that came with the case. It is marked by the pressure of the magnet.
2	Broke within a month or two. Not good quality.
2	It arrived in a beat up box with holes in it. One nut and bolt was missing ( had to a trip to the hardware store ) . The stand is pretty sturdy , I don't like the plastic top everything slides off it . I wanted to use it to hold a mixer , maybe .
2	This product did NOT work.
2	It would be a great product if they all worked. Replaced the “M” but my printer keep beeping & not letting me print anything, them replace it again same thing happened.
2	it is NOT leather, it's just plastic and has a weird smell too ! I was easily able to scratch off the "leather" off of it with my fingernail !
2	Three of them did not work.
2	The fine sands sticks to my cat's paws and she will trace it all over the floor. That causes dusts and when it gets wet,,,, even worse! It starts smelling funky as soon as I replace with the new sand. ( it is more a sand smell, not my cat's) I still get the regular Double Duty one.
2	We didn’t realize this product is for an aquarium. Probably more our mistake.
2	Way too tight around the hips and too long around your lady bits
2	After less than 2 months the clasp broke and have not been able to contact the company for a replacement item.
2	This adapter last almost 2 months. Longer than others I tried but still unacceptably short life.
2	I have had a lot of LITOM solar lights and most have been great but this is the worst !! The 1200Mah batt needs hours and hours of direct sun to work for more than 3-4 hours on the dim to bright setting when motion is detected. It is now in the trash and have ordered a different brand.
2	I ordered a pair in white, and wore them just a short while before they started getting uncomfortable. I washed them, and now there are yellowish blotches on them. I'll try bleach, and hopefully that will come out.
2	it is quite durable looking but the colors were is a little dull and did not look as classy as the images.
2	This wig is worth the price; you will have to use gel and make some snips to make it look like the picture the seller shows. I dislike false advertising-rather disgusting. The back of the wig will lift off your head and look like a hawk in full flight. I saw people staring at the back of my head and laughing.
2	No were close to 4C hair! Clip ins are very thin.
2	Over all these are a sturdy option for wireless earbuds, however the sound quality is not great. Very little bass. There are probably better options for the price.
2	Keys did not sink up to ignition. Only good to unlock door but the key fob can do that
2	Unfortunately this rice cooker broke after only a few uses.
2	I used this pillow for a few months before it separated width wide. Now it has 2 parts. I’m pretty disappointed with the product. I thought if I spent a little more it would be a good pillow. Not so!
2	It came in fast and the shipping box was in mint condition but for the product I ordered that’s a different story. When ordering I was hoping for by ordering something new the packaging would be in great or even better mint condition for being a collector of sorts but it looks like it took an old school WWF Attitude era beat down, very disappointed. The figure it’s self looks excellent and in good condition, in the end I’d rather been told upfront that it was in a damaged package and it was at least $6 less than what I payed.
2	If you have the ability to have this on PC do yourself a favor and get it on that. The console experience spoils a fantastic game. On the PS4 the frames dropped below 20, the game would pause and take more than a second to register what you wanted your characters to do. The loading times were down right annoying. Wait for your mission to start, wait for another loading screen to finish creating the map, then wait for you to just start playing and if you have to load another save it repeats all over again. If you have the option do yourself a favor and play this game on a computer.
2	Broke within the first week,
2	The white base is very sturdy and as described and perhaps I didn't read it correctly but know that it does not come with the bulb so therefore you have to find your own.
2	The length on this charge cable was nice but it wasn't very durable. Mine broke a couple of months after being used. The cord where it connects to the plug broke off. I'm always careful when plugging and unplugging so I didn't get how it broke so fast.
2	If you sleep by yourself it's ok. But if you sleep with someone else, you roll together, and with it being memory foam even if you move away the indent is still there and you just slide back together. It also gets really hot. Even with the "gel" it seems to hold heat, and can get uncomfortably warm. Maybe if I went with a smaller thickness.
2	Very light weight with no backing. Will not put them on an expensive blazer
2	There’s a hole in the sleeve and the turtle neck was awkwardly loose
2	After 16 days it stopped working! LOVED THE LENGTH! But will never buy again due to only working for a short amount of time
2	Paper and cover are nice quality, but the way the binding is attached to the cover is horrible. The first page and last page are essentially a small amount of glue being held together by one piece of paper, the whole cover fell off from the pages within 9 pages of mild usage.
2	Not an easy chair for my 14 month old to get in and out of because of the table. Poor design, also the screws that come with it to assemble don’t hold up well. Wish I could have returned it
2	Cute idea, for a dog that doesn't chew up stuff. My lab had this torn apart in less than 2 hours. I bought it because it had the KONG label, and I made the assumption that it would be less destructible than it was because it was a KONG product. This would be perfect for dogs that truly don't chew stuff, I've just never owned one that didn't at least thrash toys around.
2	Grill didn't fit securely and once I tried to snap it in place a clip broke off.
2	The motor cover projects too far over the treadmill itself and if you are walking and holding on to the handles it is too easy to trip over it. We had to return it to Amazon which has been an ordeal unto itself unfortunately.
2	The Bluetooth reception is rather good, but there is a very loud and constant static when pairing that is not there with a wired connection. I tried cleaning the aux output and then resetting the device, which made it unusable altogether since it is stuck blinking red and blue lights. I initially got this because I was impressed with the different capabilities of the device, but after using it, I am unlikely to purchase any product from the manufacturer unless I am in the market for something that flashes red and blue lights on a five hour battery.
2	Wrinkled all over. Would have been good if firm.
2	Really did not work to deter not enthusiastic wood pecker.
2	The size chart is way off. Not sure if anyone is monitoring the 'Size Chart' link vs. the sizes offered for selection. I selected an XXL because the size chart says an XL is a US size 8. I needed a US size 10 or 12. Well, the shirt is exactly what you would expect a typical XXL might be. It's very confusing as I've ordered some of these Chinese made shirts before. Sizing is all over the map -- sometimes they follow the size chart and sometimes they are the actual letter size. Makes it very difficult to guess which one it might be. Wanted a few new tops for my niece and of the 6 Chinese-made tops I ordered, only one fit. It's a waste of time to wait for them and then to have to send them back due to this type of error.
2	I got this wallet around two years ago and initially really loved it - it is very convenient and holds everything you would need for travel. However, when I used it again on my last trip I noticed that the entire lining became very sticky and left a sticky film on everything I had in the pockets (including credit cards, money, passport, etc.). I did not spill anything in the wallet or leave it in a particularly hot area that would have caused it to melt. I also only used the wallet when travelling abroad, so in two years it only had a few uses. Although i really liked it when I first got it, it's basically useless now because everything I put in it comes out gross. Very disappointed!
2	I'ts a beautiful picture and vibrant colors...BUT, The diamonds won't stick. Disappointed
2	I was initially happy with this product. The only major ding against them was the battery life. They tended to last 5-6 hours instead of the advertised 10. But to be honest, I never actually expected a full 10 hours anyway. Battery life claims are universally exaggerated. This product was no exception. Over the past 12 months, that already-iffy battery life got even shorter. This past weekend the headphones died altogether. They won't charge and they won't turn on. It's not like I overused the headphones, either. Since my purchase 12 months ago I estimate I have used them fewer than 50 times. Compared to people who practically live with buds in their ears, that's nothing. I don't expect miracles, but I do expect more from a product like this. I won't purchase another product from this company any time soon.
2	Many of the flower petals were falling off as I opened the package. Not that life like. I don't think they'll hold up outside in the wind. If you have an indoor planter where people can't get close, ok.
2	Fits pretty small and the fabric is not the quality I expected.
2	Not getting any foam. When this is attached to my pressure washer it takes away most of the power. I assume I must be doing something incorrectly. albeit I haven't figured it out yet. Have used hot water mixing half and half with car soap. Might try different soap but when compared to online videos the foam is coming out at a greater force than on mine. I'm using a 1500 psi pressure washer. Minimum required in description is 1000 psi.
2	Nothing like the stuff that comes in the box. Think sharp vs mild
2	I’m not into thongs thought I’d give these a shot. They’re comfortable as far as thongs go- I prefer g strings wanted to try thongs. Front pouch coverage deceiving cuz the only photo with a model allegedly wearing one shows a much narrower front pouch- I like minimal coverage I wouldn’t have bought these if I saw there was so much fabric in front. That being said, I like the waistband sides are like string bikini and tail is comfortable would’ve gave it 5 stars if front was narrow like the 1 photo of model allegedly wearing it
2	The comb is nice, but the scissors are crap. They do not function smoothly, there is too much friction while operating them. Hard to explain, but as if they are catching on something when trying to open/close them, if that makes sense. Feels like faulty manufacturing.
2	The pour spout seems to have some secret means to drip everywhere regardless of how careful I am. I have an older version of this 2-cup measuring cup that does NOT drip like this. Otherwise nice enough.
2	This was very cheaply made. Very thin material, not at all as cozy as my other carrier hoodie. Big gap around where baby’s head comes out so it’s not very warm.
2	Playing with the switch in handheld mode, using this product has a lot of input delay.
2	While they stuck they were good but then they all fell down
2	When I placed this outside the cage there was a small gap where the bottom didn’t touch the cage. Seeds still got all over the floor.
2	One of the four arrived broken. There is no way to contact seller to get one replacement.
2	I've been buying these vitamins since 2014 and I have always bought 150 count. When I got my bottle today, it said 120 on it yet was going for the same price as the 150 tabs. Also the vitamins look different than my previous bottle (see picture). What is the deal?
2	Broke....had to return it....but it was a funny shirt
2	When the 3/4 power step were to low an arch I briefly tried them and put them back in box. Checked the return box and filled out requested info but no response on return.
2	The corners don't fit well. Getting ready to return the band. I ordered new fit watch. 3rd try to found the right band.
2	I like the earbuds bcuz the are small & comfortable. They were easy ro pair. The only thing I don’t like about the earbuds is that I haven’t has them for long & already the right earbud doesn’t work. Which stinks because that’s the one tou need ro talk on the phone.
2	The quality is great but if for some reason you shake it the cards drop... Hope you improve it.
2	Pretty but slips and slides. Very light weight. No backing to speak of.
2	I don't know why the book say Amazon Rentals when I purshased the book I send the picture of the book
2	I bought the dark chocolate and the milk chocolate was mailed to me
2	The product did not communicate with my garage door., although my learn button is yellow on a Extreme Garage unit
2	The product is excellent minus a few points when I tried to answer a call and the caller couldn't hear me. After a few months the right earbud stopped retracting and I tried filing a claim with Asurion, which they just passed on insuring it and said contact the manufacturer, but now I have no phone number or person of contact.... thanks a lot.
2	As soon as I pulled them out of the package the limbs started breaking not all of them But a few
2	My 8 pound dog destroyed this in about an hour
2	Did not help remove the rounded bolts. In fact it just rotated around the bolt even though I used power tools to tighten this device tightly onto the bolt. Then there is the required need of extra space just to fit the device which makes using it a bit tricker in most tight spaces. I would not recommend it.
2	The battery life is incredible, but the device make a weird beeping sound when playing audio. The mic has no noise cancellation. Fits like normal earbuds.
2	Received yesterday charged all day today and 2 dont work.
2	My screen cracked after a few days with this case. The case isn’t durable itself either. The plastic has chipped on all of the corners.
2	Well made for what it is ---- but what it is is cheap plastic. Sent it back.
2	Really didn't work for me
2	I like the finish on the product however the real issue was the size. I expected it to be larger like another one i have but it’s thin and tinier. Since i already put it together i have to make due /: just check to make sure it’s the size you need
2	I love matcha. I believe I am addicted to it. Typically I have two matcha lattes in the morning, and its like jet fuel that energizes and motivates all day. I got this one trying to save some money. Everyone is different, I suppose, but I really don't like this. Compared to others I bought, it tastes awful, in my view. As the item is non-returnable (I accidently ordered another one :-( ), rather than throwing it out, which was my first impulse, I am keeping it to experiment with it in cooking. Will update as I add it to recipes. It may become a welcome ingredient - who knows?
2	Good product but doesn’t fit all inner wheels check before you purchase
2	The paper is fine quality, but super disappointed in the packaging. It arrived with the plastic wrap completely torn off and many of the sheets are bent on the corners.
2	The digital numbers stop working on the read out , now it’s a guessing game on the amperage
2	My mattress is 7” and not 8” as described. Mattress was vacuum sealed and no way we can pack this back to return this.
2	The case itself is decent. The fingerprint unlock does not work with screen case. Attempted numerous times. It will work on screen but not when in the case.
2	Box was damaged. With medication products, I prefer not to have damaged packaging. Won't buy from this supplier again.
2	After 3 days or so it fell by itself avoid this. 15 dollars thrown to the trash
2	The clock radio was great at first but the display has stopped working after a month and a half of use. I'd be happy to change my review if the company can fix this or send a replacement. I haven't been able to contact them yet.
2	Very hard to use because it's too wide for your braces to really move around. Gonna use mine since I bought them and suffer the uncomfortableness. But won't purchase again. Great "idea" though.
2	They fit my 2005 M50 with no problem. Screwed right in. First problem, the lines on the lens, the left side is parallel with the ground, the right side is 45 degrees off. Makes the bike look funny when looking at it. Second problem, after 3 months and 3k miles, one of the smoke lenses popped off the "chrome" part. I think I will just invest in LED's next time.
2	They are very leaky. Very hard to control how much paint to use
2	Starting to fall apart after a couple months
2	I am sure it might work for you
2	This is a good looking case that stands up very nicely. Unfortunately, the corners broke off after a couple of months, rendering it useless.
2	More buttons which add shine to the jacket than I thought. In the picture the jacket looks clean but in reality...too many brings (something which I personally don't like)
2	They are heavy for swimsuit and really don’t do much
2	Don't bother - almost think they don't make different sizes in this shoe, esp. if you're a sz. 9 or up. Tried twice via two sellers and ordering two different sizes got the same shoe each time...never fit. Wasted effort. Can't speak to the durability, but note it is a heavy shoe.
2	Instructions are incomplete. No instructions nor images to show how to add cards. You say above "Shoppers find images and videos more helpful than text alone." So do purchasers, but alas, nothing here.
2	Like most, we learned to love these little candies in Italy where the are manufactured during the winter months. Unfortunately, I have yet to figure out how to enjoy them back in the USA. I have ordered them from 2 different vendors on AMAZON and, in both cases, they arrive with a crystallized or leaking liquid center (the coffee). Simply, they have an extremely short shelf life and are very sensitive to temperature extremes. If anyone knows a vendor who can provide a fresh product, please advise - many of us would like to know.
2	most of the product was empty. pigment not so intense.
2	The temps do not match what other temps give. I would hit a spot first time it is once temp the next time it is a totally different temp and never has given close to same temp twice. Next time ill spend a little more money to get a better product.
2	ok until it fell off the wall and broke.... cheap fogged up a lot, hard to read.
2	This was poorly written, my ebook had multiple editing errors. The plot was boring and typical. I go into romance/erotic books knowing that it's going to be played out but there was nothing about this book that stood out to me.
2	These brooches are not ideal for making an all brooch bouquet. They maybe ideal to adhere to flowers for a combination bouquet as I did.
2	I absolutely love the look of this. I’m sad to say that it constantly was popping off and I finally lost it. I’m tempted to order another one hoping it was just a fluke that it didn’t snap on super tight but probably won’t.
2	In general the image is good, I only paid 80 bucks for this projector, but if you pay the full price, you can find a few better options for a better quality image and a more silent unit for the same price. Honestly, the fan is LOUD and awful, if you use the unit in a noisy environment then is not a problem.
2	The product was doing well for a few months and then suddenly it stopped working. The part which you step on to create pressure in the tank stopped working and filled up with water.
2	Very disappointed with the packaging. FedEx driver handing me a thin plastic bag with no protection at all. Box was ripped and had some dents on the corner of the battery.
2	QC issues all the way around. The first order I cancelled was charged and sent anyways and the order I did want came in wrong. emblem itself looks pretty good though.
2	Sensor Wayyyyyy to sensitive.looks nice
2	The batteries came in 5 small boxes of 4 batteries, but the outside box says 24 batteries so it should have been 6 boxes of 4. Are these fake, why would each box state 24 and only 20 batteries were included. Others have the same comment. Anyone know why the small boxes of 4 are put in another boxes than states 24 and not 20? The product description states 20 so I got 20, but it seems the batteries have been repackaged.
2	tree too small, my wife didn't like it.
2	I bought this hoping it would be more like the Wrangler Riggs work jacket. Sadly, it was of significantly poorer quality, had only buttons rather than a zipper front, the hood fabric was very thin, and the size (I ordered a 2x) was way too small, more like a Large, with very short sleeves. I returned the jacket.
2	It is poorly made. It hold water when it rains and rusts. The height did not really work for me. A waste of money.
2	The length is great. But, the mechanics used to squeeze the jaw is extremely stiff and it's difficult to get the jaw to close and grip tight on whatever you are moving (see picture) It's all plastic and feels like it's gonna break. I would return it, but I've already used it.
2	They seemed fine at first but smell like urine when the dog chews them. Odor is noticable without getting very close.
2	Did not work once it was in the water . the pouch camp opening up letting water in thank God my phone is waterproof
2	Very inaccurate for marking
2	I dislike the fact I have only received 5 pair of socks vice the 7 I paid for with this transaction.
2	I bought two of these mugs, and idk why this black mug sounds like it has sand inside it. The other one, a golden one, is just perfect it also comes in a travel bag
2	Bad fit and dead spots on the screen
2	I purchase this item June 22, and it stopped working four months later. It does not charge.
2	This toilet paper ran out really fast, it was thick but didn’t last long.
2	Owned this item for a couple year now. Cute novelty gift, but very poorly designed/executed. The batteries are very difficult to install. Display blanks out some numbers about once a week, usually clears up after you cycle through modes. Overall - Meh.
2	All the main features work (power, volume, input select) . The menu select only has BT pair so it cannot adjust bass, treble, night mode, or any of the other features the soundbar may have.
2	Nice but not what i espected.is just some liquid with sparkles.The smell is nice by the way
2	Portability is really the only thing this keyboard has going for it. It has an awkward layout, slides all over the place when typing, and it pretty much non functional for any productive tasks.
2	Would never sync to the hourly chimes. Extremely frustrating and not worth the exchange.
2	I’m not so sure about this. The directions say let it run for thirty seconds. Mine only runs for about four. I’m still looking in stores for them.
2	Its been two weeks, still have not received. would not recommend
2	First, these are so expensive for some small, cheap, plastic drawers. But they came to me very dirty and had scrapes that I can’t get off. If it wasn’t for the scrapes and the expensive price for such small drawers, I would have liked them more.
2	I wanted to return, as it was described as shag plush rug. but were going to charge me $10 to ship back. this is not cool... Item not as described, I should be able to return on their dime... buyer beware
2	Worked well for first hour or so but then started clogging and sputtering. Had to water down the paint so much that it was really runny. Can't get into the nozzle to clean it out. Finally went back to brushing because we were changing the heads so frequently.
2	This particular Pop! is of lower quality, which explains why it was an "add-on". You can see the glue at the back of Benny's head, and the paint job on his face is less than stellar. Just goes to show, you get what you pay for. I will not be buying something as an "add-on" again.
2	This product is attractive, but it doesn't do what I thought it would from the description. They show it being used as a backsplash, on countertops, etc. I only wanted to use it to cover a wooden box that I used to stand a mannequin on in my shop. It sticks, but just barely. If you bump it or something brushes against it, it comes loose. So I pulled it off and used it on the floor of the cabinet under the sink, and it does okay for that. I cannot image it being sturdy enough to be a backsplash or a counter cover.
2	The plastic connectors are terrible. They leak.
2	This is a beautiful and challenging puzzle. Sadly, when we got just two pieces away from completing it, we discovered that two pieces were missing. Two other pieces were duplicates. Reading the reviews, I discovered that this seems to be a problem with this puzzle. I returned it for a full refund. It is very frustrating to spend hours on a puzzle and not be able to complete it. Also, the pieces are not interlocking, so assembled pieces come apart easily. A shame since this is one of the most beautiful designs of a puzzle we have seen.
2	I want to love this shirt I really do... When I first got it had a very strong odor to it. So I decided to wash it before using it on my son for his 2nd birthday party. After washing it there were several cracks in the truck where green fabric show through. I'm still going to use it because it's only for one day however for the $15 I paid I expected it to make it at least a few washes... Oh well it's still cute and the truck made my guy happy
2	Necklace attractive but was too tight, may be smaller than 16"
2	I ordered these because the picture and description specifically indicated that they were for the Fusion Proglide (NOT Fusion 5 Proglide). The Fusion 5 Proglide cartridges do not fit the older Fusion Proglide handle. The service was good in terms of shipping (which is why I bumped the rating up from one star), but please update your product picture and description so that it is not misleading to others, as it was to me.
2	My physical key didn't transfer over well. The spring action never smoothly allowed key open when I pressed the button. Everything else lined up smoothly with the chip / board inside and felt of good quality. Still need one sadly.
2	The product is quite nice but the description lacked a size for the inner pot and that turned out to be not much larger than my 3 qt. double boiler.
2	Love these bars, but I ordered the variety pack and i got a weird variety pack with flavors I've never had and don't really like. Upset.
2	Super thick, good coverage, way too oily. I don’t have acne prone skin but I broke out with this. Also need to wash your face several times to remove completely
2	The perforation between each bag in the roll is not quite finished so tearing each bag from the next is more of a ripping effect than breaking clean away. Other than that they are not bad.
2	The light tape is fine, but when ordering, nothing is said up front that there is not an adaptor included. Luckily, I had some adapters that I could use. This should be in the product description.
2	It dries out too fast but it it's good for a glass fountain pen I would not recommend it to use the refillable cartridge on this because it will dry out in it and you will have to Queen.
2	I have ordered this twice now in TEAL and each time I’ve received a light blue!! I’m including a pic of what I get as TEAL,and this is not the picture shown for TEAL!! I’d very much like to get the Teal if you have any ideas?!
2	I've taken many pump powders. This one has been the least effective. Notice no difference at all in the form of pump nor endurance. also, you cannot mix this with a preworkout as its very sweet on its own. the taste itself is rather good.
2	This is how I received my order. Great reviews, but unfortunately poor delivery and/or packaging.
2	The pattern is similar, but still quite different and disappointing. The colors are dull and not nearly as vibrant as those displayed on the website. I would not have made the purchase if I was aware that I would not receive this throw..
2	The product would likely be good if it didn’t arrive having been previously melted or melt in shipping. Just ruins the quality. Messy upon opening because the chocolate coating has been ruined.
2	The trunks are fine when new. However, within 4 months of normal use (I swim 2-3 times a week at a pool), my black trunks have faded into a strange green color.
2	it didn't work to good
2	I was so excited to get this classic movie and show it at school, but the case came pretty cracked leaving sharp edges. The dvd plays, but the case is ruined. Nothing else in the shipping box was damaged, so I’m tempted to believe that the case was damaged before shipping.
2	None of my earrings fit through the holes. So disappointed
2	Used 3 drops in diffuser, no smell.Put 10 drops in diffuser and could barely smell it. Won't buy this product again. Not strong enough.
2	Wanted to like it but the smell of this material was very strong - almost mildewy like - and it also did not fit comfortably across my body. which is why I returned it. Unfortunate, but I would not recommend this.
2	Worked twice. Then did not. Neither with plug adapter of batteries.
2	Window shades keep falling off the window. Don't stick very well or at all. Trying to figure out in purchasing suction cups so shades can stay up. Waste of mone
2	I bought this for my wife and while she loves the scent, it does not last for more than 1 hour.
2	look great but all bulbs burned out exactly 4 months after purchase - no indication of warranty
2	It says that it is stainless steel, I used it on my boat just once, and went to use it again 3 days later, and it was already full of rust, I guess the stainless steel is poor quality..
2	Weren’t as big as I thought
2	Poor design. not only is it corded only (Which I get), but it uses a Bluetooth USB loose cable, so the chances of it unplugging from either end are greater. Only viable for very confined setups. There's better options.
2	I really like this sweatshirt. It fits well and is very soft. I’ve had it for a few months and always wash and try it on normal cycles with no problems. Until I accidentally wash and dried it inside out. The lettering fused together and rips when I try to separate it. So after a few wears it’s completely ruined. 😔 I’m so bummed.
2	I send it back, the ped was stiched in the worng place. I hope it was a mistake because the fabric it self was good and it fit great.
2	Didnt give me the wave i was hoping for, too late to return it now :(
2	make spark when changing the number for fan. bought two but need to return the other one. I just don't have time to remove it and return the one already installed. wouldn't recommend this for any one.
2	Box and table were damaged. Some reviews said this seats 6, which would be a really tight fit. Will seat 4 comfortable. Medium weight.
2	The material isn’t that good it still shows off every dent nook and cranny even if you wear another dress over it.
2	Not very sturdy, works fine with slippers, sneakers though.
2	These are very soft and cute but they're kind of tight and the bridge does not extend enough, so it's hard to wear them like you're supposed to without messing up your hair, but if you have a small head these would be perfect!
2	Bought the set as I had 160 holes I needed in some support braces. Using the 1 7/8" bit, I was able to drill them but noticed halfway through that the edge on two of the 4 carbide edges had chipped. Given the soft wood I was using, I'm concerned about the durability of this set. This bit still left a flat hole as the other two edges were still intact. Kept the set but am not impressed.
2	The noise cancelling works fairly well. The problem I have with the black pair of the ear plugs is that I could not get them out of my ears. The center stem was too short to get a good hold of. I had the get a smal pair of needle nose pliers to pull them out of my ears. The other pair wasn’t bad. I actually expected something a little more heavy duty. It’s a nice carrying case but the plugs I can’t really give a good rating.
2	ended up returning these, the material feels much better than the faux leather ones but these just are not very comfortable at all to me. I'd stick with the 6mm one and put one of their covers over that much more comfortable
2	The bottom portion of the razor holder is not bent enough to hold the razor in place. Shower door shuts and the razor falls.
2	Bulbs are bright as advertised. But in a batch of 72 about 6 have already burned out. I see the comment about them being in enclosed but they are burning out in non enclosed
2	Handle was bent over when it arrived due to how it was shipped. Base of item is cardboard, so may not be very durable. I hoped to put the OXO wipes dispenser in one side (it fits) but I could see that it would weigh down that side and bend the cardboard more. Returned.
2	Lacked of functionality
2	The fire starting component is butts.
2	Heap looking founders. Didn’t even look as good as a cheap drugstore set
2	Not such a fan of this mixer. Bought this to make cookies this Christmas season and it can barely get through some butter and flower. Very weak mixer
2	Perhaps I didn’t pay enough attention to what this product is made to do, but for me, all it did was add weight and grease. There is no additional lift, no definition.
2	Looks like a neat little trailer but the product was cracked and needed extensive structural repairs. Appears it was dropped during or prior to shipment. Shame on you Amazon
2	Like the look. Can not figure out music function. Instructions are vague at best.
2	Took a long time to get it and it runs too small
2	I LOVE the cup, but the lid leaked from day 1 and you can't take the lid apart to wash it. They need to provide better lids.
2	It was cute, I’m plus size and this fit bad. Bug in the top because I’m short and tight and unflattering.
2	I like the sturdiness of the case but in just a week the stand ring became too loose to use to stand up my phone from any angle. If it wasn’t for the fact that amazon Has become too cheap to send FedEx UPS directly to pick up items of this price from my home even though I’m a prime member, I would have returned or exchanged this. Very disappointed. I had better performance from a cheap promotional pop socket in terms of durability of the stand.
2	I was hoping this would be a sharper instrument but it was not. Disappointed
2	Nice a glass sticker it’s on the entire screen but the glass is not so clean..
2	Pain to take. It seems that every product wants you to take it on an empty stomach. Not going to do it.
2	The picture shows the earrings as ovals but they are circles.
2	Bought this in Feb 2017 as a replacement to the faucet I installed Feb 2014. First one slowly clogged with relatively soft water. Second one lost the on/off button in 6 months of very minimal use.
2	Didn’t realize it was a refurbished machine. The filter was full of dog hair when I received it .
2	This brush pushes hair to one side where one can then vacuum it up to a certain extent. But, I found that it missed too many hairs that are deeply embedded in cloth. I also found that if I got a small plastic dish with water and dipped my finger tips into the water repeatedly, my fingers worked much better than this brush at getting hair out. Perhaps, in a wetter climate, this brush might work better. I really wanted this brush to work after reading all of the positive reviews, but it has been pretty much a bust.
2	Just received these in the mail and will say that these look really nice and seem durable. As a few others have mentioned, I compared charging speeds and they do charge very slow. Another thing I didn’t like was that they wiggle by the charging port with may or may not mean that the charging speeds are affect but enough to question it. I will be returning them and possible look for a fast charger.
2	The straps are too narrow to fit the very wide strap mounts. The strap mounts looked crooked and misaligned. Very disappointed in this camera and the fact I'll have to carry my camera in my hands at all times during this trip.
2	Supposed to be compatible and not machine specific. The characters work fine but the Spider-man playset (world) does NOT work with Disney Infinity 3.0. Disappointed our 7 and 6-yr old boys. Too bad.
2	It seriously smells terrible!! If it didn’t smell like it does it works just fine but honestly dislike using it because the smell lingers long after use.
2	I purchased this in a small and it's massive. Even after washing and drying it trying to shrink it it's still too big. I gave it to my friend who normally wears size medium and it was even too big for him. The quality seems fine otherwise. It smelled strongly of chemicals when removed from the package.
2	I love the fact that it comes with a lens cap I just wished the lens would stay on the piece that slides. My wide angle fell apart completely and not from heavy use. Definitely a good product idea just cheap materials
2	It take to long to get
2	I tried using the iron twice, and it leaked! Even on the high 'Cotton' setting, I wasn't able to steam the pillowcases: they were being soaked with water. It was returned. The hidden cord wrap was a feature that I liked for storage.
2	I was very happy with this charger up until now. It’s just stopped working, not even 3 months after purchase. There’s no rips or anything physically wrong with it, it shows the charging symbol on my phone but it’s not giving it any juice. I had it on the charger overnight and my battery is 44%. Not too impressed.
2	It lights up but on day two it would only change colors right when i turned it on then after a few weeks it wont change colors att all. It red and only red now.
2	Disappointed in description of product
2	Darkening effect went out once during use right in the middle of welding. (No, that wasn't scary at all *sarcasm* ... and a little blinding). The screen does not work at all like it should. I find I have to hit the top part just above the screen most every time I use it. The screen will flicker before coming on. Sometimes it will release back to normal visibility. Sometimes. If it doesn't ... *whack!* to get it to stand down. The battery compartment has come apart along the top as the battery cover is a severe PITA to remove. (Removed battery to check it to make it wasn't dying and causing the problems). Save your money. Get something better
2	It's not very practical.
2	Cheap, plastic came bent. Not a very good scratch sensation when compared with other backscratchers. Very small in size
2	The product picture is of three discs but only one arrives. SO FRUSTRATING!
2	They run small at least one-two sizes smaller. Ordered a 36 waist. More like a 32. Sadly will have to return them
2	I bought this to feed the cat when we are away for weekends. It seemed to work but sometime on the weekend some other animal (probably a raccoon) got into it and ate all the food in the hopper. Fortunately a friend came by to check on things and noticed it was toppled over and empty. So would work indoors e.g. for a person with unpredictable work schedules or the like, but not as an outdoor feeder.
2	It advertised for an electric set and it was battery.
2	not made really well
2	The plastic around the edge broke at the headphone jack within a few weeks. Cheap and not worth it.
2	it worked good for a few months then the pump got clogged. I looked up ways to fix but I still could not get it to work
2	Honestly, I don't fell any different. I have no idea if there is any benefit to taking the product after 30 days.
2	I bought my first two of these at Walmart for really competitive prices, lost one when I left it in a Tokyo Hotel. Couldn’t find them anywhere over here so ordered these from Amazon, and had them shipped to my PO Box. I wish I hadn’t of. First they are about an ounce or two smaller than the ones I bought at WalMart secondly, since one of them is defective, in a big unusable way, for just one useable one, it was really expensive. I do not reccomend that you get these from Amazon. I might be able to find a new flange for the one with the defective lid, but I am not sure how, or where, and sending them back from overseas seems a pretty big hassle. It leaks like a sieve. Totally unusable.
2	The salt shaker has 1 hole and the pepper has 3. So it takes FOREVER to salt your food.
2	I've handled many different HDDs for a long time and I've never seen one kick the bucket so suddenly and with less provocation. I get it, not every HDD ships perfect. Never had to deal with Seagate support before, so hoping this goes smoothly and I can update this review in a few months with something more positive.
2	Great design, however I was shorted a few bags.
2	The adhesive does not work at all. It stayed up once for the car ride and wouldn’t stick after that. Huge disappointment because the rest of it works but pretty useless when it can’t stay stuck so it’s always falling over
2	These were nice at first but I've only had them a month and the lights are different colors like ones white and other is off white. Finally today one just completely went out.
2	This stevia powder is not very sweet. I have to use 3 times the amount I use with other brands of pure stevia and it is still only mildly sweetened.
2	This item had lots of positive reviews but I didn’t have a very good experience with it. We had 20+ 10-11 year old boys to play capture the flag for a birthday party. One orb kept stopped working which was basically a game stopper. The wristbands don’t stay on and would frequently break. I spend so much time dealing with the wristbands that don’t work well and unsnap easily then break. The markers also didn’t all work correctly and took about 20+ minutes to get some to work. This has good potential but the quality of the products is low. After spending $90 for the main kit and expansion I was quite disapppointed
2	I did not get the nuts or bolts any of the hardware that came with itI wrote a review about it and have never heard back I need the bolt that screws into the skill saw
2	I am disappointed that my stool came damaged. About 20% of the seats rim is dented. The legs appear to be sturdy; but, the material on the top is cheaply made.
2	I did not like it at all. It was watery and the color was yellowish and not a great consistency or coverage. Not at all what it was advertised as.
2	It does not work with my Fire TV Stick, only with the Fire TV. Like the old YouTube App.
3	It's a very nice kit, it came with all the accessories, BUT my waterproof case was broken, the thing that closes it was broken so I can't close the case and now the case is useless. And I bought this kit just because of the waterproof case.... The rest was fine as announced.
3	I think the suitcase and backpack are very cute however, it’s been a little over a month since it was as bought and the suitcase lining inside already has a ripe in it. Not happy about that. We have used the suitcase 2 times only.
3	Ok for price, don't last too long for me.
3	Just ok. A lot of similar colors
3	I think it is really pretty, but I am worried about the strength and if it will really protect well if I drop my phone. My husband says that he thinks it will be fine but I don't know. The screen protector doesn't cover the entire screen but 95% of it. I think that I will be looking for another case that I feel more confident in it protecting my phone.
3	It does look like the picture but it isn't great quality, construction paper and glitter letters. You also have to string it yourself. I probably should have made it myself.
3	Only 1 of the 2 will stay attached to the vent. The other falls every time I turn a corner or apply the breaks too hard.
3	This deodorant smells terrific and does not cause irritation. However it also clumps up entirely, causing it to just rub itself into my shirts rather than stay on my arm pits. Also it doesn't provide any sweat blocking. This would be good for someone who shaves their armpit hairs or wears baggy clothes.
3	The odor was very strong. I aired it outside. I still haven't used it but after 5 month it doesn't smell it so I can use it
3	Smaller than expected but overall seems okay.
3	I searched high and low for a pair of size 4 toddler rain boots, but most brands started at size 5. So, I was so excited when i found these and thought they would be perfect for my daughter. However, they're actually BIGGER than the size 5's I already have for her. Now I have 2 pairs for her to grow into, but none for her to wear now.
3	These bands are too thick and color was very unnatural. Gold is too yellow.
3	I was expecting 100 large whole pig ears and got some like that, but alot that were not.. Would not buy from them again unless they change this.
3	I love this product so much i bought it twice! But their customer service is TERRIBLE. I received the second glassware broken and did not receive a response for one week and STILL have not heard from anyone to receive my refund. I received it on time, but am not happy at the moment.
3	Nice rack--didn't fit my cross members
3	Now that it is installed, it's a good mount. But the lower pipe arrived with the pin holes misaligned, preventing the pin from going through, thereby preventing it from connecting. It took many hours of work to take apart the lower section and realign it. QC is lacking and instructions were subpar as well. Still, if you have the patience to figure it out, it's a good value
3	Reason why I’m giving 3 stars is because the hats are a bit uncomfortable since the bow is a bit bulky in the inner part... but they look cute overall and keep her warm. Also the sewing seems like it’s a bit defective but we will see how long they hold.
3	Only one of the locks works.
3	Looking for love may led to healing
3	For some reason, a signature was required to have a poster delivered...mind-boggling. Anyway, I'm sure it's really nice and exactly what I want, maybe I'll actually see it early next week?
3	While the order was delivered on time, the packaging was open and missed all erasers. The only reason I did not returned it back that I had an order for additional erasers, but be careful what you are shipping. So, it is probably more to the packing department not the product itself, but I am not happy receiving open/damaged packaging.
3	Poor quality! This wouldnt stay inflated.
3	Have not notice a difference
3	Carb did come damaged/bent on the intake side of the casing. Choke cable was different and required modifications, throttle cable guide was different and also need modifications. Idle was also different than OEM. In all took a few hours to get it to fit and have it work correctly. 3 stars for it working once modified to fit.
3	A size smaller than normal. Poorly sown. Seams rip easily. The left leg is significantly smaller than the right.
3	I like the size of this cup and it does keep my drinks cold, BUT the opening for the straw is too large and my drink would splash out of the cup. I bought this to take to the gym, but after a week I had to find another cup because you can’t carry it in a gym bag and if it rips over on the floor, your drink will splash out from the top all over the place. Total bummer!
3	There are a lot of flaws compared to Chamber of Secrets, but still worth playing. It would've been so much better if they had taken out the troll bosses though
3	My fiance LOVES his skeletool... until his blade broke in less than a wk & I'm having a hard time finding replacement blades. Leatherman is supposed to be high quality & would have gotten 5 stars (bc my fiance uses it daily) but I'm not happy about the blade...which is pretty much the point of this tool.
3	nowhere near as pretty as picture
3	This lasted me about 1.5 years until it stopped charging. It lit up but my phone was losing charge. When it worked it was good. You do have to push the charger in and I can see some looser sockets not working and sliding out. Worked in my 2009 Hyundai Sonata.
3	Great set but Gk has weak teeth and the spinning plate on revolve falls off easy I lost mine but aside from that galaxy Zeus is one of the best stock combos ever
3	Lots of accessories. Had to find a plastic box to hold all the stuff. The plastic box the cameras is in, doesn't have a bottom once you open it, so its just a recycle. "user manual" in very small print, hard to read. Would be nice to have a link to a real manual. Hard to identify pieces and what they are for. No information on usage. Can't say if it works or not, as the memory cards (I ordered separately) haven't come yet. Took a while, bu I figured out how to open the box, and the camera.
3	Only lasts about 4 to 5 hours total.
3	These do not deal so the leak easily
3	No as good as I would of liked, bends really easy while cleaning teeth..
3	It didn't fit and wasn't accessible for my injectors...
3	Works as advertised.
3	The opening is very small and the suction is not very good honestly I prefer to use my Plastic one from the dollar store at least it sucks LOL
3	It's been difficult to get thru this book... story interesting but the writing is not so good
3	I did end up breaking out from this deodorant, so I don't use it anymore. It also stains clothes.
3	I’ve had other mattress pads that are waterproof, and this one feels like plastic. Not a huge fan.
3	This is pretty wimpy as far as diffusers go but it’s really pretty and has a wide range of colors. It only runs a few hours with 5-6 drops of oil. Better for a smaller room
3	I get the impression that I wasn't the target audience? I don't know, this felt like a well made direct to DVD sort of movie. Had I watched it on Netflix or maybe the Included with Prime section I wouldn't have felt as cheated. Nice but not terrible or wonderful in any aspect. On a scale of "I want my time back" to "Dude you need to see this" I give this a solid "Meh!".
3	The product is fine. I've been eating these since I was eight and I'm now 50 (they don't make them like they used to but they're still not terrible). The main issue was the massive wait for shipping. Granted, I was notified that the shipping would take longer than usual, but the overall wait time was ridiculous. They first missed the estimated date of arrival, then notified me of the wait, THEN they arrived, and when they arrived, they were 10 days (!) from expiration (and if I'm not mistaken, these have a shelf life of about 3 months). The people shipping these need to get it together. Please make sure with the seller first when they are arriving, AND expiring!
3	Firstly, I taste neither "raspberry" nor "lemonade" but instead something more like watermelon and some unknown taste. Very odd. And worse, it coats my mouth in ... something. Is that the stevia? I dunno. Regardless, I'll pass...
3	Cover was gross but the book was fine
3	Good shoe, but it’s not bright white at all. The shoelaces are bright white but the leather is a bit off white and I think this is misleading. Keeping them though because they are comfortable. Not happy with the color.
3	Good lock but could not get it to work
3	I bought the black ones, the stars are a bit more faded that the ones on the picture. They are ok.
3	It came out in a few washes
3	I can see why the price is inexpensive. I received yesterday, expiration date is for sept of this year. No way will we use all of these in that short amount of time. Very deceptive!!!
3	Too bulky and there was a gap behind my infants ears, I’m sure they would have worked okay but I want them to work great!!
3	Not as long as shown on picture
3	We use dog poop bags for our kids poop diapers, helps control a smells in the room. These bags work well, however, these bags do not have any amount of lemon scent as stated in the product title.
3	Doesn't really look that much like Gamora and is not very articulated but is okay.
3	waist too tight - sent for exchange, and all is not good.
3	Doesn’t work if you have another Alexa in the house
3	These shorts are fine for the price, I would have given them 4 stars but instead I give them 3 only because the zipper in on of the pockets broke, not a big deal since I usually don't carry things in my pockets while riding. the fit is good not too tight or too baggy. The adjustable waist is a nice feature.
3	My Frenchie had no problems with the green color. He can hardly wait for his dinner. He’s not a picky eater so he had no issue with the texture or color. He didn’t chew dry kibble so he would always get choked and spit whole pieces up hours later. I switched him to canned food about 2 months ago. I found this food online and it seems to be a healthier option. Update: After about a month, my dog lost interest in this food. He would never walk away from his bowl with food still in it but he started doing that with this food. Unfortunately, the food search continues.
3	Cheap. My own fault for going cheap.
3	Good but very small for adult ears
3	The tiles are very small and feel cheap. They look like what they are, cardboard glued to magnets. I work in the print industry and I could make my own and do a better job.
3	I am on a quest for over the calf socks, am on third brand. These did not stay up all day.
3	Every individual has his own needs, I like the design & feel, but I did not like the thick sides, it becomes bulky & wider for the phone to hold.., I only need minimal protection & to minimize the slippery back.
3	I used this pen a lot on a normal basis. The click mechanism wore out quickly. I would only use it when I needed it and not to fidget with. The pen itself is robust and worked well until the mechanism wore out.
3	I liked the feel of the material, but was a little tight.
3	I had to take in the arms and bodice. My girls are average 5-7 year olds. And they both were to big.other then that there very beautiful the sheer is a tanish color. One of my girls is lighter then the other n you can see the difference.
3	Pretty small balloons. Much smaller then average size party balloon. Only held helium for less than a day.
3	Love it but battery life was Short. Purchased in December and need a replacement battery in March. Otherwise it's ok
3	The top is a bit too cropped for me, but I love the skirt! Not a big fan of showing alot of my stomach. I'm going to switch it up on the top part.
3	Came highly recommended by various kbeauty bloggers and Reddit. I thought it was okay but didn’t blow my socks off.
3	The large mat is nice. It is made up of some kind of very thick felt material. The rolling device is a cheap inflatable device. Sucks for me because my cat found it about 1 week after I got it, poked holes in it, and now I can't store any puzzles
3	I love this spray but one of the bottles had a nozzle that just spurted out the spray and couldn’t be used.
3	Very adorable plants, however don't water from the top, they mold easily, also mine are not growing super fast.
3	Loved the suitcase but it didn’t fit in the carry on container at the airport!!! I bought it specifically to use as a carry on and I was told by United, Belgium airlines, and TAP airlines that I had to check because of the size. Great suitcase if you don’t mind checking the bag, but if you wanna use it as a carry on it doesn’t fit
3	These fit fine and are OK to wear as slipper sox. Too thin for use with Pilates equipment. The reformer was particularly uncomfortable. I had purchased these specifically for Pilates, so I am disappointed. I will still make use of them for other purposes.
3	It’s ok but not as comfortable as I would like. The band is too stiff and I can’t sleep with it. Nice features but I can’t wear all day because the band is bothersome.
3	I have to order a lot of these, because they do not last very long, constantly getting holes in the material, and leaf debris blows through. Also, the zipper does not last for any length of time either. The zipper pull portion that holds tab in place moves and tab becomes free.....eventually it breaks, no pull.......and the zipper also does not fit together and is constantly separating.
3	First cord broke within a week. I guess that’s why they send you 3 at a time. The price is good, especially for 3, and they look really nice, but it’s not really worth it if each cord is only going to last a week.
3	The flavor is ok, but overall is ruined by how powdery it is when you bite it. Doesnt taste great.
3	This material is extremely prone to static charge and the hair clings to it.
3	The ruler and radius gauges are inaccurate. Good enough for a beginner looking to learn basic guitar maintenance
3	This is to hard to hit. Low slowing games are no fun in a video game
3	Loved the material of this suit, the bottoms fit perfect, unfortunately the top has a side boob issue, feeling like if I moved just right I would pop right out on the side without a strap.
3	Very cool color, but I wish it was packaged with more care. The bottle was busted, so it was covered in green dye staining my hands.
3	These feel sturdy, but they are pretty shallow. You wouldn’t be able to drain a lot of noodles or whatever at a time.
3	I’m too fat!! But this dress is cut very nicely. If I were a few pounds lighter, it would be great. So summer look out here I come!! (Diet first)!
3	It's rolled down to about an inch in diameter making it HORRIBLE to try and unroll. It creases, it lifts from the paper, and it's basically impossible to lay flat. The color is good and the reflective capacity is good, only reason for 3 stars.
3	not the greatest quality but it did what it was suppose to do
3	The good: For the price, the quality seems solid and the 9" inseam is a good length. The bad: I'm not sure why these shorts are listed as slim. The leg opening is 11" which is wider than many regular cut shorts and if you have slim legs these pretty much look like you're wearing a skirt.
3	Tried to wear them for 2 days, but my heels were uncomfortable. They are a wee bit to small.
3	Excellent quality to the cover, holds up well and is sturdy. However the frame is a total failure. First wind of only 10 to 15 mph and the frame was bent all out of shape. I replaced the frame with shaped 80 gauge pvc and now works beautifully.
3	Okay product, difficult to shape for good fit, gets really mushy and hard to work with.
3	Table was easy to put together and is very sturdy but it arrived with damage to the finish which I had to repair myself due to time restraints. Otherwise a great product
3	It is good value for the price. But the ipad does not stay in the grooves easily and it often slides out. Perhaps if there was another groove and/or deeper grooves it would be better.
3	Nice color little small not very spacious.
3	The picture is deceiving. image is smaller than what it appears!
3	The cardboard holding it was torn and I was unable to gift it as I needed. :(
3	Looks pretty but very thin cheap metal.
3	Pay attention to measurements because the mugs are tiny. I couldn’t even put a normal sized mug in their place because most of my mugs are 2 tall to fit. Also only holds 10 oz total of water
3	Doesn’t appear to be well-made. The little twirly piece that moves the popcorn kernels inside the pan would get stuck at times. I wasn’t very impressed with it.
3	A terrible item I ever bought. Upset. To be truth, rubbish! Fake product! Pure Junk. This was my worst buy yet.
3	Would be better if they were a bit larger. My collars are still somewhat tight.
3	Just received today. I’ve had the light on high for 3 hours and the wax won’t melt. The bulb isn’t hot enough.
3	So much larger than expected, hard to fit in pockets
3	My first and only cut was an English cucumber. The product does what it says but because it is not as sharp as you would expect your vegetables are not as easy to cut. Also, I guess I should have paid more closely to the dimensions because it is also very small. I am not returning it because it is not worth the effort but will buy one that is longer.
3	Works good, breaks too easy.
3	Drawer organizer is just as pictured but the slide out sides are pretty flimsy and probably won’t last too long.
3	It was very mild/vanilla
3	Plastic housing is of poor finish, for a pricy machine.
3	Probably very comfortable but you will need new sheets with extra deep pockets. I didn't think about that when I ordered. And it's not that easy to get it into another box.
3	They are durable but they came with a super strong smell. I had to put them by the window for 2 days to get it off. This makes me think the material they use is not very safe because they had a strong chemical smell, but I don't wear them all day so I'm not that concerned. They look like the picture and they are comfortable.
3	We have bought two of these. One for each kid. The silicone breaks rather quickly. One was broken in a week and the other one in about 10 days. I would be hesitant to buy this product and search out one of higher quality.
3	Not the best quality, but do the job, once you reinforce with nails and glue.
3	The product works well, nice feel and weight - just a big disappointment that the 'metal' cover on the end that is screwed in was cracked. Returning for a replacement...
3	I really like that they are sheer enough to let in light yet provide privacy. I also like the fabric. however, they are so crooked. I moved them around to fit the best they will, but I sure wonder who hemmed them. I didn't return them as they were inexpensive, and you do get what you pay for. they'll be ok for a temporary curtain.
3	It's not as advertised, you will still need to scrub your panels to get it cleaned otherwise with this alone, it's just like hosing it but adding a coating
3	Coat seemed nice but I think the brand does not use US sizing because it was about 2 sizes too small for what should have fit me. I even went a size up than normal to account for wearing layers under it. I had to return it.
3	Not what I was hoping for, my bearded dragon has a very picky pallet it seems.
3	Warm but not as warm as expected in 22 degree weather out riding atv's. Better than a regular sock though.
3	I really like the design and the feel in my hand. However, there is a huge negative for me: the L and R buttons when using the case is considerably harder to press. I tried flexing the rubber but to no avail. Maybe I'm missing something. I don't know.
3	I read other reviews before I purchased these about some of the wafers arriving broken. I decided to take a chance. Well the first of the four boxes I ordered had a lot of broken wafers I was trying to make the whipped cream dessert recipe on the back of the bos. It is a bit difficult to make with broken wafers but I was able to find a way to make it work. I would probably purchase these again even with the broken wafers because I cannot find these cookies in the store. And, my family would not be happy without the chocolate whipped cream dessert. So what's a girl to do!
3	Funny, not like funny haha but funny. No actually it's mostly funny haha. I received a free copy and this is my voluntary review.
3	The heat doesn't work great, but the message is great.
3	I love the light it gives on my selfies or group pictures. The only thing i hate about it is sometimes the light will just turn on by itself and or blink wildly by itself. I can't control the light sometimes.
3	Thought there was a face protector
3	Good price. We'll see how well they work.
3	difficult to get to and the screw holes don't line up exactly but it works. will get the more expensive one in the future when this breaks
3	These containers are the perfect size and the lid fits the container...which is a problem that I have had when buying a different cheap container. My only complaint is that these are NOT sturdy. Two were completely damaged during transit, even though the packaging was perfectly fine. The containers are made of thin plastic, with very little give. I also dropped one...less than two feet onto the carpet and it cracked it. They are cheap though.
3	I bought this instead of other highly-rated laptop risers because of the adjustable height and angle. However, the adjusted angle would not stay in place over time. I had to keep screwing every few days which is super annoying.
3	I came to this product after having so much trouble finding the Twin Lab chewable calcium citrate. I got the berries and cream flavor. It was good in the beginning when I started to chew, but the more I chewed and it dissolved I started to get a bad taste that continued on to become a bad aftertaste. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s not a bitter taste but it’s certainly not a pleasant taste. Another thing I didn’t like is that each chew has 4 grams of carbs. I need 1500 mg of calcium per day due to Bariatric surgery, so I would be consuming 12 grams of carbs per day. I’m trying to follow a Keto way of eating and would prefer it not to have so many carbs just for a supplement. It has corn syrup and sugar, and then they added Splenda. I guess the aftertaste would be worse if those ingredients weren’t there. I do applaud them for avoiding aspartame. I do like the fact that they used calcium citrate instead of carbonate. I also like the fact that one chew is 500 mg. It has some Vitamin K2 in it as well which is good. I’ll continue to take these until I find a reasonable replacement. I’ll just have to have something ready to eat immediately after these chews to hide the aftertaste. I’ve always had very sensitive taste buds. Probably nobody else can taste what I’m tasting in these.
3	Somewhat short in length
3	Battery run out very fast
3	The product works fine but the squeaking is extremely irritating.
3	You should know that the fabric of the back of this jacket is not the waterproof/windproof material that the front is and is much thinner, which I imagine would be very helpful to evaporate sweat while riding. I could only imagine freezing my sweaty back off on a cold mt. bike ride during a stop to fix a mechanical, so I sent it back.
3	Cell phone holder cracked. Did not drop it. This is the first time it has happened to me
3	These hangers are soooo useful ans space saving. However they are not durable i have had at least 10 of them break out of the pack of 50 i bought les than 1 month ago. They break when you rotate the hook. I wish they were more durable.
3	Not very crisp noise at all, seem cheaply made, but fair for the price.
3	This swing will work for my toddler but there is no way it would work for an older kid or teenager. The plastic is very thin and it seems cheaply made. My baby likes it though. Shipping was fast
3	Great sudsing and cleansing qualities but it’s a huge no on the Early to Rise scent.
3	Had just a bit too much Citrus. Really nice try though.
3	I kept losing WiFi signal from time to time, wired part was good just wifi feature was not satisfying
3	If you have narrow to medium feet, these might work for you. If you have medium to wide, you may not ever get them on. The knit is not stretchable like it looks in the picture. One good thing, once they are actually on, there is plenty of room in the toes, unlike most shoes. Wish I could stretch out the weave. The seller was very accommodating and gave me a refund. Good customer service.
3	The banner is exactly as pictured except for one detail: each letter is sent in a package included with a string and a needle and you have to assemble it yourself. For the price I expected it to be able to just be pulled out of the package and hung up. Luckily I opened the package prior to the party. 3/5 stars because although it accomplishes what I purchased it for, I likely could have made it myself for cheaper, since I’m already playing arts and crafts with this might as well have just made it all.
3	not the best shampoo...overrated
3	I'm 5'5 about 175 lbs and I ordered a large just to be on the safe side but it was a bit big. Will gift this to a friend that will look amazing in it. Overall, pretty dress just a bit hard to guess the right size.
3	Amp works good, wire is pretty decent quality over all it's a good product, only bad thing is it took a long time to ship
3	The product is fine, we've been using it for years. What chafed me is the way it was packed to ship. The box arrived with the tub on its side inside, loosely padded with large blister packs. The cap was unscrewed from the tub and the foil seal was torn, causing some of the powder to spill into the inside of the box. Messy, but not a total loss. Still, the least effective packing job yet by Amazon.
3	I like the design, color, and size options. They didn't slip, but the whole time I wore them I kept thinking they were drooping. They are worth a shot, but I don't think I would buy again.
3	While the lemon scent was very nice, the packaging says up to 60 days. I used in a non-smoking car and it has had it after 20 days.
3	I like the headphones as a whole but after 60 days the connection to the jack became iffy and sound is now dropping in one ear. If they fix this will change my review.
3	I bought this for 1 gal kombucha batches and to be honest it’s just not necessary. The gallon must sit higher than the bottles so doing everything on the counter will not allow the siphon to flow. So I used it as a pump which was ok... Ultimately this broke while cleaning, after the second use. A tiny part came off the tip and now it won’t even function as a pump. The ratings is based on it inability to fully clean/it breaking after second use
3	This game's simplicity is both it's greatest asset, and biggest weakness. I love how you can teach anyone this game in two minutes, and have a good time. It is also a quick game, and the turns end quickly. On the other hand, this game feels very restrictive. You either constantly run out of cards, or it becomes boring if you hoard them for too long. It's missing a "special sauce." The game could likely be salvaged with another element of strategy--perhaps another card type.
3	So I usually wear a 12/14 in pants. I recently found out I'm expecting, so I went with the 2xl, thinking they would be big and roomy. Well, I'm glad I got the 2xl because they are tight! Not at all the fit I was hoping for to get me through the hot Georgia summer. The quality is ok, nothing special. In my opinion, they are over priced for the product you receive.
3	It was tight fitting but manageable for someone with medium to slender arms. It completed my Supergirl costume and I received many compliments. The colors are exactly how they're pictured with the logo and all.
3	Sometimes repetitive and a bit too earnest. Really wanted it to end earlier. Enjoyed learning about ancient sites in the U.S. and potential reasons for their placement.
3	Velcro seems to be loosing its grip already.
3	This product is difficult to open, spilled a little on myself trying to pry the can open while at the gas pump. you will need a long funnel to be able to pour it in your tank. Came expired so possibly an old product. Do yourself a favor and buy plastic long neck bottle version of this.
3	Great set. One of the parts came off of a bowl. I contacted the seller and they said for me to glue it back on. I did not glue it back on. There are probably enough items to keep the little one happy.
3	I love the design, the quality of the piece is not as good as portrayed.
3	nice fan but the remote does not work, was refunded for the remote but I will have to disassemble the fan to install another remote unit.
3	looks cheap. feels ok. my guess is it will not last long
3	Lucy and her mother, Wanda moved from Tupelo to New Orleans for a new start. Wanda got a job as a hairdresser (Lucy helped out in the salon) that came with an apartment above the salon... This was a short, fast, "okay" read. There was nothing here that makes me want to continue with the series. I was not that interested in the storyline or the characters. Just not my style, I guess...

3	The retaining nuts that loosen/tighten the braces fell out and I can't find where to contact them for any warranty support. Google can't even find them so where is their support folks? Warranty? Anyone? The lock nuts should be "captive" in the bracket and not able to just fall out on the road.
3	Wore these with new pair of shoes that tore up my heels the week before. As a life hack, I have found that KT tape in its original form worked wonders for this purpose in the past, far better than any other blister prevention or bandaid. However, I cannot say the same for the current blister tape Im wearing. After half a day, it has worn completely through, exposing the skin underneath - whereas, any KT tape wearer can attest, true KT tape is so difficult to remove, it often comes with the first layer of skin when you take it off. In other words, save your money and just buy strips of actual KT tape- works way better than this product.
3	Not of Swarovski quality
3	If using an otter box, trim the edges to fit or they'll lift up. Works okay.
3	Shoe is okay but am not too comfortable with the fit on my feet.its abit too formal for me.
3	Nice sizeable rug, very soft maybe a little thin making it cheap looking
3	The material is not soft
3	Doesn't stick as well as I'd like. But good little case.
3	The lights are beautiful, however, 4 are defective and I am returning the item for a replacement. My hope is that when I receive the replacement all will be operational.
3	You can not adjust the osd... Its not Beta flight Configurable. So you always see band voltage etc. Its power hungry so be careful turning it to 500 MW it gets really hot..
3	This is just ok. The levels are pretty close together so it’s hard for my son to really use them if it’s fully stacked. The levels are easily toppled as the stacking bricks don’t really hold together all that well.
3	Pops loose on occasion (has fallen from dash and magnet and pops open
3	These are kinda like the cheapo ones you get at the eye doctor, the wells are deep and it’s slightly difficult to get your contacts out.
3	Was really good to use, especially it being waterproof but at the 6 month mark it started to glitch where it wouldn’t turn on and I had to reset it constantly
3	Good for eyeshadow but made my eyes burn while taking it off and for glitter it didn’t hold up well
3	Good for kids to play with, not particularly pretty balls or box.
3	We love these, but sadly the paint came off batman’s Head within three hours of opening the package.
3	Havent got my order yet
3	Leather is kinda thin, and even using the last notch, it's not as long as we thought it would be. Color matches guitar well.
3	Book is good, but the hard back book corners we're damaged in shipping, could have been packed better to safe guard my product. However it did arrive on time as stated during ordering.
3	Took a long time to arrive. Medium was a little baggy
3	I do enjoy them but they are some what loose fitting
3	Afraid they will swallow in one bite
3	So stiff that my daughter refuses to use them.
3	Ordered a size 12 but it fit like a size 11. I would recommend going up a size
3	I am a bit disappointed in the sound quality especially if I combine 2 sounds like rain on the window and distant thunderstorm. I am going to rethink this purchase.
3	Smaller than expected.
3	3 stars because the eggs are fine they’re just not the size advertised so I can’t use them the way I intended.
3	Did the job, but very cheap and left blue fuzzies everywhere
3	The battery is great! I now have at least four hours of battery life, as opposed to about 15 minutes before I replaced the old one. However, the tools that were included are simply caca. I had to buy a whole set of security tools just for the three-bladed screws that need to be removed. Very frustrating! Be sure to factor that into the total cost when considering this vendor.
3	One bulb works fine the other never worked from the get go.
3	Previous ratings were low for accuracy and there is still flex after tightening the nuts to fix the position of the dividing points
3	Works well but leaves dusty white on black lingerie, which is the very reason I tried it (trying to find an alternative to powder).
3	Fits well and is just like oem except the oem have metal on them where the nuts go so you can't over tighten them. With these you can simply keep turning the nut until it pulls all the way through.
3	This product came, very clearly, with the package sliced open. It appeared to work properly, but someone obviously opened it and sent it back........so lucky me. I’ll leave it at 3 stars for now, since the product itself appears to work as advertised. Just not happy to get someone else’s reject.
3	Arrived hot cause Amazon said posted that it wasn't out for delivery that day so we went out for a few hours, surprise- it's status went from not arriving that day to delivered. Seller said it's okay that it was hot cause could handle some heat. Don't know if it worked. Haven't seen any signs it did or didn't. Don't think I'll get this next year.
3	Good looking but don’t stay tight
3	Bought for my daughter in Colorado. Didn't like the interface as well as the one I have. Not really as useful. I can't really describe it, but it was just not as nice as the newer ones. It works, but not impressive.
3	Item was slightly smaller than expected. Fine craftsmanship however the overall dimensions were less than what was expected
3	Very cute shoe, and I have a little bit of wide feet and that would of been okay, but they were to tight for my big toes. I had to surgery last December and my toe is wider now from it.
3	I dont like it. It is ok for my hall
3	After using this for the last month, it charges phone at normal rate just fine. However, the product states it will support rapid charging and that does not appear to work. Phone never displays rapid charging and the timeframe it takes to charge phone supports that rapid charging is not working. Has solid construction overall.
3	the top is hollow so you cant store anything on top
3	Doesn’t have much butter flavor and seemed more like oil than a butter from a movie theater!
3	I love the style of this fountain but ... The base/pedestal is so thin I can see daylight (voids in the base casting) through multiple areas of just the base and one of the ball design features around the column was broke/shattered on arrival but ... that is understandable seeing as how this one came out of the mold before the final coat/coats of fiberglass were applied. Hope it's a fluke in production because I want another one just like this one for another area of my property. Here's hoping.
3	Dont last long enough even for my 20 lbs pup
3	Missing 2 in the box....
3	I wish I had read through the questions thoroughly before buying these, as I did not realize there are only 5 in a bag. That’s nearly $5 a bone that only lasts about 2 days in our home. The bone is not odor free either despite it’s claim. We have tried other brands that claim that as well, but these do definitely smell.
3	Too small for my wrists. Not comfortable. Good quality though.
3	Looks like it could be a beautiful mirror but it came damaged. The packaging was not damaged at all.
3	I’ve had these for just under 3 months. I loved them at first, and I still appreciate the comfort and convenience they bring to my day. However, they quickly become gross. My nipple hairs, lint, and skin stick to the adhesive. They now have a slight odor after wearing them during sweaty summer days. You can rinse then off with soap and water gently, but you can’t really rub them because the adhesive begins to peel away. These are pretty great for short term use, but over the long term there must be a more durable and affordable solution.
3	Shipping label was placed on the box itself. This made it look really tacky since this is a gift. Item itself is nice.
3	Short story collection from various authors. Needed a bit more editing. A nice book with some quick reads for the busy holiday season.
3	It's cool looking, and super fun but it's a toy, get yourself a serious pair of goggles these are a novelty.
3	Do not know it is a gift for my grandson.
3	Not a great connection when pumping tre up.Struggle to get firm fitting.
3	This is fun for family's and children but not as good as I would have hoped when I downloaded it.
3	It's a well made seat cover, but its way too big for my car. I own an Infiniti G37.
3	My shade missing few magnets on few sections. The magnet is strong enough to hold in place, even when it's a windy day; although, the shade did not prevent ice built-up on windshield last winter in freezing condition. Its material did absorbed some moisture, which caused it to freeze as well. It is quickly to install, remove, and store it away.
3	If your headlights have almost any curvature to them I would recommend not wasting your time or money on this product because it gets a bunch of crinkles in it that are virtually impossible to get out of it is however exactly as described and works exactly as described
3	The bracelet is very cute and I do like it very much. However I was very disappointed that it did not come with a box. I bought it this for a gift and I don’t have a box for it. I’ve bought Alex and Ani before and I know it should have a box. I guess it costs less and is easier to mail without it?
3	I was a happy MetroPCS customer for years, but we moved to an area where the signal sucks so I switched to AT&T. Needed new phones (Ours were quite old) so I looked for an affordable alternative. These looked like a good deal, so I went for it. A few things to keep in mind... 1) One of my phones was new. The other had a SIM card in it, all of the protective plastic removed, and was obviously used. No damage, but I paid for an advertised "Brand New Phone" and am not happy that this one is used. 2) All of the embedded MetroPCS apps are there, but if you are not on Metro none of them work. I have disabled all of the apps I could, but you can't shut them all down, and you may want to use some. I don't have find my phone, for example, and there is no "voice mail" icon to indicate when you have a voicemail and your only access to voicemail is to dial the "1" on the key pad. 3) The playback volume for media is not very loud- my wife uses hers to watch videos off her facebook feed, and you can barely hear them even with the volume all the way up. Overall, I like the phone. Had I known it would be used and would lack some of the features I wanted because although it is unlocked it is still a Metro phone, I would have made a different decision. You might decide differently, but at least you know more than "ITs a great phone and works with AT&T" which is all the information I had to work with.
3	just received it....havent used it yet....love the size and the various ways to us...
3	nice writing but characters are some of the dumbest people alive ie: unbelievable, not plausible, outcome predictable.
3	There were errors in the writing. Some of the dialogue was confusing, the way the characters spoke to each other ( maybe that was intentional) but it did I not add anything to the story. I have read books by this author before, this one was a little confusing all around. They story overall was ok. There have been better.
3	This is my second one the 1st one zipper broke so I decided to try again. Hope this one lasts longer.
3	Doesn’t work as well as I’d like. Falls over.
3	Not sure if these were right for my vehicle they look right and plug in but not as bright as factory yellow cheap bulbs.
3	It would have been beautiful and useful except it was broken when it arrived. It came in an envelope. It should have come in a box so that it would have been more protected.
3	It,s OK. Cheap but I didn,t expect much. I do like the adjustable function. If the charger cord was any shorter it would be non existent. Easy to take out and about.
3	Is there any way to trouble shoot?
3	They work well enough to use if you're just sitting in a room. Battery's not great and the connection with my phone is terrible when I put my phone in basketball short pockets. Yes, I tested this out. I already have headphones that I use when I'm lounging around so these may get returned. The price is good, they stay in your ears, the sound is good... but the fact that I can't hardly use these if I'm out and about makes me feel like I wasted money.
3	Got it for daughter. She wanted the black leather storm trooper one so this mine now. Thick, stiff but sturdy. Gotten several compliments.
3	My daughter absolutely loved them, on bummer was that one broke when she went to wear it the first time.
3	Think this book had potential to be really good if there had been further development of the characters and story line.
3	Didnt really seem to work much.
3	Missing some time of the little wood dowel pieces that hide the screws. I have purchased two of these before and not had that problem. Otherwise a very nice luggage rack.
3	I should have paid attention to the product description. I wanted a typing trainer software package to load onto my kids' PC, which I do not leave connected to the internet to avoid the necessity of constant monitoring. The description clearly states that the product being sold is an access key to an on-line class. Given our situation, the on-line nature of the course seriously limits its utility. Serves me right for not reading the product description. On the other hand, the classes themselves look decent. Training and repetition are limited compared to some of the old programs I used back in the 90's. The videos are ok, and the games are a lot prettier than what I grew up with, which I guess is good for engaging the kids.
3	Feel pretty good but condom broke.
3	These pants are very nice,good fit and length. The material is good quality.They washed well and no ironing. All this is fine. However, why don't you do something about that dreadful non-snapping snap?? Several reviewers have mentioned that the snap is terrible, especially on such nice pants. We snapped the snap shut (not easy) and my husband simply uses the elastic waist to pull the pants up and down. Very inconvenient, but works! Fix that snap and I'll but another pair for my husband.
3	Easy in, did the job.
3	the cheese cake pan was too small to hold recipe for instant pot so it ran over. Will try to find a different recipe and try it again. I would also prefer fewer but larger bowls that fit in pot. The quality of pans very good 11
3	This shirt fit fine & was ok quality, but the color of the sleeves was not at all what I expected. It was more orange & burgundy than black & red. I returned it.
3	Disappointed that no power cord is included. They recommend using a power cord for things like keyboards (which is one of the main uses for items like this), but don't include one. I already had one from Ultra that I had misplaced the power cord.
3	I didn't like the fact the gal container was opened when receiving it and shipping was apparently hard on it as it had spilled and a lot it was inside the box it was shipped in.
3	Fits well, but doesn’t warm up enough.
3	Over all the Parkland Pet Foldable Playpen is good and the size is large enough to let our cat have enough room to have her litter box and bed and toys in when we went to visit our son when we helped him move. HOWEVER, the bottom would be better if it, too was made from the canvas material the rest of it is made from. We clip our cats nails, but the bottom got holes in it and we had to use gorilla tape underneath to prevent it from getting worse. Also, at one point her water dish tipped and it got wet underneath on the carpet, so it's not waterproof. You get 3 stars because it does do the job, but it could be better.
3	We ordered this game for outside time camping. Got good reviews but we were not completely satisfied with it as our blocks were not totally smooth...which affects the game and some chipped upon first use of the game and we also have a cracked piece.
3	It is good to have USB charge connection. It is too big for travel.
3	Planted them none of them came up
3	The quality is good, I’ve had them for a few months in a humid environment and in the bath twice and they didn’t rust or look like they will rust. It’s not very easy to get the tool around both sides of the ingrown toenail, and it didn’t work like the YouTube videos I’ve seen. As I was screwing it tighter to straighten the nail, my nail just broke off, now it did brake off the ingrown part, so I did get some relief at the moment, but it was really short and of corse not straight so it grew back ingrown again. I would not say it fixed my ingrown problem.
3	Very small print. Hard to read
3	Suprisingly very nice to work with. They are not as deeply pigmented as more expensive pencils, but I find they have nice pastel like shades that will come in useful on occasion. Also they are a bit harder than most pencils so will keep a point longer, and will be handy for tiny spaces. I use pencils for adult coloring books.
3	For light-duty it is a very good flashlight. Nice and bright and can use basic batteries. Unfortunately I bought them for work. I've dropped two of them and both of them quit as soon as they hit the ground. So definitely not as durable as I need. If you're just using them around the house or in the car very good light. If your hard on lights then I would definitely avoid these. Get the small single AA tactical lights that can use the 14500 rechargeable lithium batteries. With the lithium batteries they are extremely bright and extremely durable. I've had two for almost 3 years and drop them constantly. Even dropped one nearly 12 feet onto concrete. Never had a problem with them.
3	I have to say that I like the quality of this cover. But it has blown off my car three times during storms. Each time I resecure it. I live in Florida and we have had some strong storms but I think they need more straps to keep it on car.
3	This product was as described. The only reason I returned is it seems to be cheaply made by Vera Bradley. The seller was great to work with.
3	This is my mother's favorite coffee. We normally have no problems with it. It arrived busted today and is not eligible for return. The coffee is great, the shipping was less than...
3	I love the light. It is 3 way which is perfect by my bed. putting the backplate on the wall was easy enough, only problem was the white knob(s) that are supposed to cover the screws that hold the backplate to the wall and then come thru the white lamp face plate were missing.......no....one was missing but the one that was there did not fit properly. these are not just decorative but essential to hold the plate to the wall........ inside the box was the email address and phone number I plan on calling tomorrow and asking for two more white screw covers...other than that it was easy install and works great!
3	Good flavor, good product...just a really small jar. The normal size jar I usually see this brand of bouillon in is on the right of the picture. A bit expensive for the price. The only reason I would buy again is I can't find this brand for sale anywhere else right now.
3	I have very dry, and sometimes cracked, heels. This works ok, not great. I have had other creams that worked better (prescription cream containing urea worked the best).)
3	This product did help to clear out my skin a little, but not as much as I expected. Not disappointed because I know my skin doesn't usually take to just any product. I do like using the soap on my body because it makes me feel a lot cleaner for a lot longer than traditional soaps.
3	This thing is not as large as I had imagined when I purchased it. That said, it would probably be a decent bag for travel if you only have a few items of clothing that you need to carry. I would probably not purchase another. I gave it three stars because the construction seems to be solid enough, it's just too small to be of much use to me as an actual laundry bag. YMMV.
3	This produce is good for light light sanding but nothing more.
3	Didn't care for the flavor. Seemed garlicky
3	the chain was cheap but the locket and charms were good
3	It was a nice, slow rising squishy but the top broke off not long after playing with it for a while. It smelled nice.
3	Shorter than expected. Kind of difficult to put on and lace up. The jewels were coming off, upside down and neither of the gloves looked like the other. I will need to spend some time fixing and sprucing these up.
3	it does not stay on tile
3	Cute costume. The pants were too long for our 17 month old but I was able to cut the excess off and you couldn’t tell. Overall was a good purchase for the price.
3	Thinner than I thought it would be. Not bad if you have something to go with it.
3	I love Clark shoes but....I had to return these because they hurt my feet by my big toe.
3	Item was very bulky around the arms and thin around the waste. Cuffs were just hot glued on and sewed: you could see the glue.
3	Very soft and fit according to size chart provided, but... I would not wear these to run or workout in at all. No compression at all which helps for blood return and muscle support, not to mention smoothing out the lumps and bumps. These would be great for lounging around in or as pjs. Oh, the other thing I'm not thrilled about is that the color (I got the royal blue) is no where near as bright or vibrant as pictured, in fact they aren't even royal blue. They're more of a regular blue with a slightly lilac hue. So there's that. 😩 But like I said, if you're looking for lounging leggings, these fit the bill. But for actual exercise... not so much. Next!
3	I bought this for my daughters 2nd birthday outfit, the stripes are blue when I figured they would be black and the two pinks (bow and tutu) do not match, the bow is much brighter than the tutu. Hopefully it will still look good.
3	I purchased these locks because they were described as having 7mm shanks. I needed that size to fit a hitch ball lock opening. However, upon arrival, they did not fit as the shanks were 8mm. Returned immediately, thank you Amazon! The seller's description was inaccurate, not sure why.
3	Sound is pretty good, stylish looking speaker but the length given on the cords is rediculously short! I am going to have to by extenders just so it doesn’t look like my speakers are trying to strangle my monitor
3	The stands strip easily since they are a cheap product. I use the green screen frequently but the stands for the lights don't lock in place very well.
4	Love the power of the machine, the weight and the longer cord. Suction is great for dog hair and dirt on bare floors. Crevasse tool is great for getting into small spaces. I have 2 older models ( 20 years ) that are heavier and still working. Hope this newer version lasts as long. Slight problem is the shorter dog hair sticks out of the cloth bag and is harder to clean out. I like the cloth bag because it is more environmentally friendly,
4	They fit, but are flimsy
4	They are smaller than I thought they would be, but this is only my first time buying boxes. I got the 2" x 3" x 4" ones. They're a bit hard to assemble but I'm learning. Great for smaller packages and parts.
4	Feels almost like a light jacket, it'll make you sweaty. The Radio clip loop is a nice thing to have
4	So nice...I bought it twice! One for me and one for my sister! Heats and froths perfectly. Easy to clean. Prompt shipping from vendor. Packaged well.
4	super cute and adjustable. now to see if they will hold up and work well in montana.
4	These bags are really nice if you’re trying to reduce your plastic use or you just want a reusable alternative to ziplock bags. These have a closure similar to a ziplock back but their material is better and washes well. My only complaints are that they are not dishwasher safe and the openings aren’t super wide.
4	I received a slightly tilted item. I thought this is how it was designed. It was better to hold like that as well, but later I saw that the main shaft is bent/damaged, and that's why there was the tilt. Also the material of the umbrella is not the best one. It should be water repellent or resistant, but it seemed like it was getting wet.
4	Nice product, nice price. We will use them for craft projects.
4	This product is very hard and must swirl my fingers to warm up and use. Wasn’t sure what to expect, still what I believe I need for lips, cuticles . No aroma that is bothersome
4	The pocket should be centered more towards the middle.
4	This air purifier works well. It circulates the air in our bedroom at low speed without much noise. It is small and lightweight making it easy to move from room to room when necessary. We are happy with our purchase.
4	Good set for the price
4	It is good for the price, but not the best quality. you get what you pay for
4	It’s a little uneven which is fine while it’s on carpet but not on firm surfaces. Although it was super simple to put together.
4	Not to bad . Very bright headlights
4	Very good grip on the ears. Prevented my glasses from sliding down my nose. Multiple colors at one price.
4	They smell weird but good quality. Does not break down easily.
4	I liked the curtains very much. Material and craftsmanship was very nice. However, the color and style of the curtians I chose did not work very well with the window and room. So, I returned them. Otherwise, I would have used them.
4	Great case i recommend getting a gorilla glass cover as well, the fabric however gets reflective as it collects dirt and dust.
4	This looks just as pictured, very cute design and very spacious. The only problem I had was the straps kept coming off but once I tightened them they’re good to go!
4	Happy with what I got
4	Very nice for the price. I have been fishing with them and they swim alright. A few don't swim well but overall they work. Still haven't caught a fish with them.
4	It's hard to use. It doesn't remember after you turn it off. Each time I turn it on I have to set it again. But it looks good. It takes a minute to get warm and the fan doesn't blow that hard. But still for the price I think it's fine.
4	So far so good. Very reasonable price and I’m happy to have a band with a buckle rather than the original stupid clasp thing that wore out quickly and kept detaching. I’m a big guy and would’ve preferred a slightly longer band but it seems to be staying on.... otherwise would give 5 stars.
4	Nice size for the back of a full sized crew cab pickup. I like the cover design. Can Holds alot. Weak magnet so much so you can't feel it grabbing at all when you open the lid. I'll probably fix the lid with either a stronger magnetic or velcro.
4	My friend who I had Amazon send it to said it was pretty with beautiful colors.
4	The product seems good fabric, but the delivery took so much longer. It didn't fit me well, was too large. But I'll use it to sleep, so it's not that problem.
4	Feel better having it
4	This is a gift so it has not been used. However it is a good quality tool, metal not plastic, and I will be happy to give it.
4	My first order was returned due to package damage. Then my second order came without bolts and clip, this is why I gave it 2 stars for installation. Would have been nice to get what I paid for.
4	Very clever perspective, enjoyed learning new vocabulary words...definitely fun!
4	Love this. Not your normal plain tiles. Better than I expected. Only thing I didn’t love was the pushers. They are a little awkward but the beautiful tiles and case make up for that.
4	Great fan but don't expect 'cold' air. The air is cool but not cold. It does the job well enough to justify not buying an AC, but if you need real cooling power, get an AC as this fan just blows somewhat cool air. But nonetheless great fan. Only issue is that it is a bit wobbly on the stand but if you're not clumsy you won't knock it over.
4	Tastes like green tea for sure. I like it!
4	If you like Mr. Rogers it is a nice book of his lyrics. The illustrations are also nice.
4	Great for behind the fridge filtering. Metal strap needed to attached to wall.
4	Very nice, soft leggings in exactly the color I wanted...only 4 stars ‘cause even though the fabric is not see through, it’s fairly thin and only good for layering in very cold weather.
4	So I read all the reviews so far so good. It is loud and the chain but I prefer the noise over a cord that stretches out over time. I would at this point recommend it to others. I just need to check with my neighbor underneath me does he hear it I don't think so but my entire neighborhood is super quiet. Outside of that its great of course I wish there was more resistance but i'm going to buy wrist weights so boom arms good and I'm going to buy the plastic workout suit so I can really really sweat. But as a person who is Obese and has osteoarthritis in both knees this is a must have.
4	It's soft and very comfortable. I didn't read the description well enough to see there is glitter on the shirt and it's a printed graphic not actual lace.
4	it was fairly comfortable. worth purchase ....
4	It fits well for post partum belly
4	I had some small furniture products I needed a clean cutting saw for and this one was recommended by a couple of woodworking websites. It took a little getting used to the pull action as opposed to the push cut like on an American saw, but I can say that it does cut quicker and more smoothly once you get the hang of it. The edges are much less rough at the end of the cut too. I docked one star because the saw is a little too flexible for harder woods, but it still is a great saw.
4	Great so far except it’s for a 12 year old and all the packaging is not English, I can see having it in multiple languages.
4	nice look, but a bit big
4	Looks to be great fun.
4	This was a good, straightforward book on what is written in Revelation. Would have given 5 stars, but verbose at times.
4	Holy crap this will go SUCH a long way. BE AWARE: this black is a blue-base (maybe even slightly green) and didn't end up matching the true black leather that I had.
4	Presumably it takes a couple of weeks for the skin to peel off after you use this exfoliating mask, so I don't know if it actually works. It does, however, smell good and makes your feet soft.
4	Our son loves this. It’s much smaller than I expected, and it looks pretty fragile. But so far, so good.
4	A nice pen, very solid. Combined it with a Zebra 401 and Fisher space pen to make an awesome pen.
4	Was looking to make my shower look more organized. Perfect size and color for my modern shower. Unfortunately the water will accumulate since they didnt put enough holes for the water to flush out. I modified it with my drill and put holes all over the bottom now I dont have a mildew build up.
4	Excellent depiction of the aftereffects of WW-II in a particular community.
4	Pay close attention: you only get one (random) color glitter. I wish there were more pipettes, I use a lot of those. Also, wish there were double if the smaller tiny molds (like the cat shape) for things like earrings. The ring mold is really too small for me (and most people I know) but my kid likes playing with the one and only ring I made. The bangle mold won’t go over my wrist (the product it makes won’t) but I mostly use it to set extra resin. Glitter sticks to it like CRAZY but glitter sticks to everything. Hard to clean off. It’s also difficult to remove anything from the taller skinny molds but still good for the price.
4	An old favorite I never tire of... even though it does feel like it should have been a full-on novel. I love all the movie versions as well. The language is kinda antiquated and will surely put off some readers, but it's full of all kinds of vivid descriptions and fascinating ideas about our possible future that still hold relevance today. The template is timeless and I can see this one being retold over and over with random variations for years to come...
4	Good size and cute but chemical smell, had to put it outside for a day it was so strong.
4	The belts are actually a brilliant idea. Not a 5 because the buckle is not as nice as others I've seen.
4	Good for the price nice clarity
4	I got this solar ground light to put in my garden. I think having a garden that have lights along the pathway is very nice, it makes the garden beautiful. I decided to test these and they work well. The brightness of the lights is just right for my garden, it is easy to install and gets solar power easily too
4	Nice organizer. Wish the binding was a bit more flexible.
4	These work fine, containing the smell well. But they are pricey. In the end, we'll buy them.
4	Great bag works well plenty of storage
4	These speakers are working out well for my computer. I listened to music while I work, and I am very satisfied with the sound.
4	Great product! Hate the Basil. Reordered in Lavendar
4	So cute! Bought a large as a gift for my mother-in-law, and she loved it. Only problem: I ordered a large and it looks like a medium. Hopefully it fits her and doesn't shrink.
4	Looks great but the only problem was the tape that was applied onto it already. It was set too low and it would be exposed when I installed the visors. So then I had to take the tape off and reapply a new one on each visor. Other than that it’s been serving its purpose.
4	Cute story. Cutest illustrations. Way too many words for a board book.
4	I really like this, it feels great, I just wish the handles pulled out and were a bit longer, I have to use sideways for my back.
4	Decent product! Made floating in pool easy!
4	My item came with a broken button, I immediately told them, I had a new purse the next day.
4	Good price I like the design. I also bought a rose gold and prefer that color.
4	looks good with my jeans. very satisfied
4	It works well. I wish it lasted longer but it is what it is.
4	We really like it. But, Not excellent for chunky smoothies if you leave the spillproof insert in. Our 1.5 yr old can't squeeze all the food up on her own without the insert, which creates a vaccuum. Also the silicone attracts dog hair. Not sure there is anything better, so we are pretty happy with this.
4	Uhhh, this thing is very powerful...LOL- works great..just be careful, 2 speeds and both are well enough!
4	Not changing phones often, this has been the best case! I tend to keep phones for 2-3 years, if they don't shatter. The back of the case seems to stay crystal clear so far. The fingerprint reader doesn't have great access if I place my thumb on it at an angle, or don't press in fully. My phone has been dropped a number of times, and still looks perfect. Would definitely go with this brand again.
4	I really like this translation and the accompanying study guides. The quality of this specific product is excellent as well. However, I had to return it because the print was just too small for my 70 year old eyes to read easily, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
4	Good purchase. My only complaint is that you can’t adjust the collar stay very easily as I thought. It takes some time getting used to but all in all good purchase. I like how the item can fit all the collar stay sizes.
4	Fantastic bracelet; very pleased with this purchase.
4	Nothing is perfect. It works well for the money. Drops a call every now and then when answer to talk. No big deal.
4	The cutout doesn't fit the screen perfectly, but that's OK. The protector installed easily with no bubbles. Peace of mind.
4	Really good flavor, smaller bags then other brands tho,
4	Good product, nice big sized cups. I make myself ice coffee for daily commute and these are perfect. I took off one star because the cups have some plastic smell to them.
4	Looks great, a bit pricey, should do the job when we need it to get to the sun.
4	They worked well for our trip and seemed to save space. Held up well.
4	They fit as hoped for and are very comfortable, walked 2.5 miles the first time I wore them. They are rather light weight compared with older Docs I have so will have to see how they wear.
4	A fantastically cheesy B movie. Its worth the watch :)
4	Little on the small end. Wish there were dampeners to quiet it a bit more but other than those two things I love it and got it at an amazing price during black Friday.
4	Granddaughter loves it.
4	So far so good. Looks like QC wasn't too concerned with looks because there was some painted touch-ups on the rubber portions around the side of the show, but since this is a work shoe, I'm not too concerned about it either. I normally wear a US size 10.5 so I got the 11 which fits very well. Will update once I get idea of how they hold up.
4	I've had a bit of time to use the knife and run it through it's regular use and so far it's holding up. From the stock image, it appears kind of cheap and almost plastic looking, but I assure you that it is very sturdy. Almost 0 flex when the blade is out as well. The paint on the thumb release is starting to fade and chip a little bit but it's purely cosmetic. For the price, I don't think you can get much better in the spring assisted OTF world. Really liking the handgun style safety so you don't accidentally deploy the knife in your pocket. Side note: check your state laws before you buy. It is spring assisted and not automatic.
4	Nice pants but, way to be big!!
4	My 8 month old granddaughter likes it but problem is she was zooming in walker first so she gets frustrated when she can’t follow us. The other one was dangerous and this is great!! My advice is to introduce baby’s to this one first and the baby will love it.
4	Should work well for anyone with fine line marker needs...Price is good, too! Take Care!
4	I enjoyed the game but I didn't like how it had only one camera view. And when I first get on the game it's very slow.
4	This product is decent, the internal timer doesn't last from year to year and usually just ends up staying on 100% of the time. It looks great in the window, and produces a nice bright light.
4	I love it I wanted a case that showed off my phone. But I gave it a 4 star because though it had great slip resistant on the sides, top and bottom... the backside can be very slippery but only if your one to be clumsy with your phone a lot. Other than that I absolutely love the case so far... but I’ve only had it a few days ... sorry no photo as I’m using the phone may update later
4	I do recommend this for beginners but if you play at a more advanced level I recommend you goto a professional instrument shop to get a better mute. Oh well, you get what you paid for.
4	Loved this book. Extremely useful for helping children learn how to deal with their anger. I have one complaint: most modern psychologists agree, children should not be left to deal with their anger alone. I would've preferred a story where the adult stayed with the child and their feelings. That's a relatively minor quibble as the story overall is an excellent way to help a child identify and process their feelings.
4	250lbs of human in the chair has ripped the inside seam (where the seat and side wall come together). On both chairs. Otherwise, these are completely awesome chairs! I have repaired the rips, and just ask heavier folks to bring their own chairs, or use chairs that are already provided at the campsite (like where we are staying currently).
4	Bravo, this purchase was a win for sure. Usually I'm a subscriber to "you get what you pay for" but in this instance you get more. I have a 17in MSI Gaming laptop that I bought this for. This desk handles it with ease. It is really adjustable and easy to use. This is the first Chinese made product win for me. I have used it all day today gaming, surfing and as a text book holder while I wrote a paper. Pros: Light, sturdy, metal components, quiet USB fan, adjustable Cons: Fit and finish could be better ( great for the price, I would pay more for better)
4	It works fine but I do feel like they bunch a bit in the back.
4	How I couldn't solve the mystery until it was revealed. It had my attention through out the whole story.
4	It helped cover our two leather rocker chairs from continuing to peel near headrests & leaving residue.
4	Compact container and many sizes.. Perfect for camping!! Thank you!
4	these were great but the Velcro did not last as long as i thought they would. they have already come apart so i can't really Velcro them on anymore
4	You must mount these in the short round switch holders to mount in a lighter style hole. The long switch holders do not have anything for the switch locks to grab. The switch will fall out of the long adapter. Mount switch without holder in a 3/4" Hole for a cleaner look
4	(All stickers were included except the Tokyo Ghoul one) Good variety of stickers! I’d say I liked about half from the entire lot but that’s just based on my preference. The others were still really good but didn’t really appeal to me. They aren’t a pain to peel off as well. If you’re looking to decorate anything I’d definitely recommend!
4	Nice big banner but the Pom poms were a pain to puff up and put together.
4	Love it! Everyone at the office loves it too.
4	Slightly higher amp capacity than my old battery and it added speed and longevity to my tools. I recommended them to my son when he needs replacement batteries.
4	Gold confetti is a little hard to see and make the ballon hang funny.
4	This is a great tablet mount, however my only complaint is, I wish the bottom surface area was larger(the area where the 1/4-20 connects). If it was larger it would create more friction. Since this area is small you really have to crank it down tight to keep from moving. With that said, It's almost perfect. Its sturdy and extremely light weight. Much better than the cheap spring type clamps.
4	Colors names difficult to read even w/glasses. Shiny. Just saying...
4	I really enjoyed it! Classic James Patterson with easy to read chapters and a quick plot. Definitely one not to miss
4	This is a lovely little dish that I will enjoy using. It would make a nice gift. My only problem with it is the knob to the lid is tapered and so smooth it's difficult to open. I have to use 4 fingers or 2 hands. I suspect the lid might get broken quite easily if someone's fingers are very dry. That part is a shame because it really is a beautiful little dish appropriate for candy or nuts.
4	I really liked the look of these denim looking blue jean leggings. They are very comfortable too. The only suggestion is put a little tummy control at the top. Even without the tummy control of other leggings I have, I ordered a pair of these leggings in black and they are just as nice.
4	Not super stable, but works fine for what it is. Biggest thing is that it does work with the older model grills. I don’t understand why the box says it wouldn’t fit.
4	These or ok. Got these to try out as a test. Does very well
4	Great vitamin pack but I think there are too many to take at once. When I separated them out throughout the day I didn't the same effect.
4	Okay soooo I finally decided to use the mask. 1st let me say that it works very well leaves your face feeling very clean and refreshed...Downside if you up for some pain then this will give you some.. The removal of mask was a bit painful and it did make me upset that it caused me But all an all it does work . I recommend that you use for blackhead area only like the nose area aand not whole face
4	I love this bathing suit! Only issue is that the bottoms are somewhat sheer out of the water, but otherwise I like this!
4	What can I say? It's a calendar. Larger than expected with large date squares that I can write in. Cute pictures of my favorite dog the Papillon.
4	Perfect size for my needs. Isn't too loud.
4	Size is a little off I should of got a small if your 30-32 get a small
4	Well built product, for the most part. The bottom flap was sewn too small to fit the bottom strap, I ended up cutting it a little bit to fit. Happy with it for the price.
4	So far so good. Charges fast. Works well.
4	Very sturdy Only issues I had were the brass mounting screws. The do snap so I replaced them with sturdy screws. Not a deal breaker at all. I also took a drop of ca glue and glued the round risers onto the main bar. Huge time saver if you are installing solo. It holds the risers in place while you attach the shelf.
4	The author helps us get to know the combatants in detail. Many archival pictures support the action. The various weapons utilized are discussed for effectiveness. Soldier's wounds and casualties are discussed in enough detail to give more depth to the human toll. It is nice to find out more about the careers and activities of many of the survivors after the war.
4	Great filter. But don’t order from the U.S. if you’re in a hurry. Takes about a month to ship from China.
4	I love these glasses. Very good quality and they look great on me. I'm happy.
4	not exactly as pictured with white Kirby Logo, mine arrived a yellow color. not sure of difference but belt worked fine
4	This was basically exactly what I wanted. They are high quality and function how I would expect. Nice mix of classic look and features. The little tag to show what club the sock is intended for is perfect.
4	Pretty easy to use even for someone with larger hands i like the size of the blades too
4	I bought this Beyblade I loved it it worked amazingly but sadly the next day the face bolt or screw if you want to call it broke, so if you buy this product I would have an extra Face bolt.
4	Very fun card draft game with a cool theme.
4	Wood pieces are good, would suggest longer boards. Plastic piece should be more sturdy. It took my cat several days then she starting to lay on it.
4	Love the shirt! My only complaint is that I wish the arms were a bit longer. I should mention that have very long arms and this is my usual complaint.
4	I just completed my first canister. It lasted me daily use from June 16 - July 25. The taste I actually like! I’m not sure how long until you start to notice changes in how you feel or your skin or anything, but so far it’s a no go in that area
4	Works well for cutting cilantro and other small items.
4	Beautiful wallet 1 row of card slots very hard to get one in. Will not be able to put 2 in. But will hold all securely. Wonderful quality leather. Design was exactly what I was looking for.
4	Love the hat but they do not leave much room for adjustment if you have a larger head! Will have to replace the velcro on the back to make it fit better.
4	Decent story, but I had a hard time connecting with the characters and buying into some of their choices.
4	Made a live well for sardines and anchovies for pier / shore fishing. Ice chest + this kit + 12v marine battery kept my bait alive until i ran out. Remember to throw a 5 gallon bucket of ocean water in every half hour or so and you'll be fine. Slits in the PVC (water outlet) were a little narrow and had a tendency to clog with fish scales if i didn't clear them, so i opened up the holes a bit. Over all, not a bad buy; the other components were much more expensive, but this seems to hold up as long as you flush the pump when you get home.
4	Just got my joggers, style is great and fit. I can work out in them and style around in them as wearing them as casual wear. As someone who works out comfort and style is a must, not to mention a good price point. I just found my perfect athletic wear from top to bottom. I plan on getting the matching jacket next. I highly recommend their wears to any guy (thumbs up!).
4	works better than the mic that came with my karaoke machine. makes good sound.
4	Super cute luxury dupe that is so functional! The only reason that it's four stars is due to the zipper, which sticks occasionally and seems to be lower quality than the zipper on the Daisy Rose wallet and the tote. Otherwise an awesome purchase.
4	Another great read. Just love S.Eddie's books. Love Silas and Jasmine and their family. Chimera is great also. You will not be disappointed.
4	Think the space is great and it is very streamlined. The latches are a little difficult to use at times. Used to carry stiff while moving cross country.
4	It was what I needed at a good price.
4	Very informative! Excellent resource!
4	The product was bought to fix a child’s motorized car. It was installed easily and seems to be holding up.
4	Super cute dress! I absolutely loved it, fit as it should. My only complaint is the material, it's a fuzzy spandex body suit, it's a hot box! If you're body temperature is higher in your pregnancy, purchase at your own risk. I'm not generally a warm person and I sweat through this dress in an hour.
4	Good cam, does why it’s supposed to do. I did have a problem after tweaking settings using IP address that the secondary guided setup would register spaces in my WiFi network name as a “+” , which I assumed was just symbolic to Foscam recognizing the space. I’d finish and notice my camera couldn’t get back online. After running setups a 4th time and working with Zion from their excellent responsive customer support, I figured out the + was being added and changing the network name. I removed the + and it worked great consistently! I’ll buy more!
4	I purchased two of them, they have a nice feel, nice size. Its about the length of your palm. Can get noisy when the settings are turned up but I like it, the only thing I dislike is that I have to keep clicking through every setting to turn it off.
4	A lot of shedding but it held up after several shampoos for about 10 weeks.
4	Folds out nicely. Full shape. Very nice
4	This burns through batteries quickly, b it it IS worth it! My son has hours of fun !
4	I purchased them for my husband because he was complaining of heel pain when exercises and want not too tight socks around the ankle. They came earlier than what they state. They are made of nice material that make soft compression on on your heels and not too tight. They mentioned it should be hand wash but I washed them many many time in gentle cycle and yep they still doing the same work. I just wish if they could make it with other different colors to match out fit. I made another purchase but for me this time. I like to wear them when I work at home as well at the park when I go to play with my kids
4	I am a musician and a subway commuter. I bought these earplugs for reading on the train and long evenings at rehearsal. I find that they are among the best earplugs I have tried in terms of fidelity. They cut volume down to a comfortable level for extended exposure while still letting enough mid and high frequencies through that I can understand what I am hearing. They wouldn't be great for total sound blockage, but they're very nice for reducing ear fatigue in loud environments. Unfortunately, they are also rather small and easy to lose, especially since they're clear. The canister that they come in is a bit narrow, and it can be hard to fish the plugs out. Sometimes I use a car key, and I worry that it may look like I am about to perform some sort of illicit sniffing activity. This whole ordeal also led to me losing one of the plugs within a week or two of getting them-- it got dropped on the floor of a dark club while I was trying to fish it out of its canister. Whoops. They're also potentially easy to lose in your ear canal-- I find that the stems are a bit short, and I sometimes feel like I'm one misstep away from a very sticky situation. On the upside, this also means that they're Very Discrete! You will not look like a nerd as one does when they wear bright orange foam earplugs.
4	Good tight fit, well made. Come in handy for several uses especially wall wart adapters.
4	Fits as expected, but rides up sometimes which is annoying. Fabric quality as expected.
4	Does as described. Pedometer accurate and heart rate pretty close. Battery about 2 days. 2 weeks in and still doing okay. The phone app could use some improvements.
4	Works great, wish the buttons were raised a bit so you could find them in the dark! Overall a good c vibe.
4	I bought this awhile back. This mattress is quite firm so if you aren't looking for that, I would probably avoid this mattress. It expanded just as expected and was definitely a great mattress considering how cheap it was.
4	Looks great, gave it a 4 no instructions for pulley and light.
4	Sherry Lansing is one of the last great Hollywood producers. Rising up through the ranks, from actress to script reader to head of Paramount pictures, her career spans the time when Hollywood went from stodgy and insular to wild and brash and into corporate-run risk-averse number counters. Through her time in charge, she led projects near to her, stepped down on her own terms, and led a life of philanthropy. Definitely worth the read.
4	This shoe is a little flimsy but it still does the job, and they’re still cute.
4	Product arrived in a timely manner. I've used it right away, and two of the fairy beasts have been caught and disposed of. I like this product.
4	This pillow cover is very cute and well made. My only complaint is that the material is very thin. It will be perfect for what I ordered it for.
4	Beautiful color and very soft! Even gave it 4 stars. I absolutely loved this wig but I had to return it because the cut is too choppy in the back.
4	Mine required very easy assembly but didn't come with lid (also had previous customers return label inside package) but that's okay I bought a lid and I am not going to send it back. Works great for pouring honey into small jars.
4	Absolutely love the sign. However the package is supposed to come with suction cups and mine did not. It’s a simple thing to replace but I did spend a little extra so I would expect to get what I paid for.
4	This is a nice set for the price. I bought it for our guest room. I marked it down one star because the 2 little decorative pillows were squished when they arrived and despite attempts to fluff them up, they look too flat.
4	Great size. Durable and easy to clean. Fits in the kitchen without taking up a lot of space. I just wish it came with a lid.
4	I thought I ordered Super Shape, not Super Shape Extreme.
4	4 of my rocks were duds. They were completely solid and no crystals. But the rest were great super pretty. Not big so if your wanting a bigger geode I wouldnt buy this box. There was only 2 medium sized ones in mine and those happened to be the best so the bigger the rock the better the Crystal's.
4	I like the pink color, but it’s not as bright as the red collar. It has two settings: solid and blinking. I haven’t had to recharge it or change batteries yet. (I can’t even remember what method is used to recharge.) We go on a 20-30 minute walk every night in the dark, and we’ve been using this collar for about 3 or 4 months. The collar is very long and can be cut to the right size needed. I cut it so that it is just long enough to where I can easily slip it on and off my pup’s head when needed. I never use the actual fastener.
4	This book is exceptionally useful in dealing with your life. Following this book, you can undoubtedly see how to sort out your life. Particularly this book will assist me with managing profoundly. I profoundly suggest this book.I highly recommend.
4	It is definitely bigger and not an organic feeling then holding it, but its east to control and the light works great. Mine did not come with bags but the holder was included.
4	Looks good but sits high and I had to adjust my hood latch. Wish it would sit at the same height of the stock grill it would get 5 stars.
4	Sheets are soft as hell, there was a pulled thread on one side(pic) super small and not really noticeable but it sucks that it’s defective on delivery. Not going to stop me from sleeping on them though.
4	munchkins plus castle panic equals how can you go wrong
4	Great little device to have for adding some bling to dishes. Again like most items today will the device stand the test of time. Have only used it once so far. Hope to get more use out of it in the future.
4	I'm still pregnant with my baby girl. But the onesie looks just as its pictured online and the fabric is very soft and silky. I'm just a little upset that the head band is a sort of DIY thing. I guess I have to learn to tie a bow lol. Other than that it's perfect and I can't wait to see my little girl wear it.
4	It was surprisingly hard for my to find slippers that fit on like a shoe, so when I found these I was excited! They cute, unique, and rather comfortable to wear. They keep my feet warm without making them sweaty (which is always a plus!). Lots of people have seen me wearing them and have complimented on how cute they are and asked where I got them. XD
4	My dog enjoys this food and can be a picky eater. I will be trying different flavors of the same Blue Basics Limited Ingredient line of dry food.
4	I really like it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was due to the lousy tool that was provided to remove excess links. It worked to remove 1 rod but it broke trying to remove the 2nd rod. I ended up having to go to a jeweler to get the job done. My jeweler was very gracious and did not charge me but others may not be so fortunate.
4	Its working but I cant get setup menu button to work
4	Deadly Partnership hooked me with the first chapter. Who was the mysterious killer? Roland was a smug SOB, but what did he do to deserve being buried alive? Did poor Wendy survive? How did this all tie in with Paul? The only question not answered concerned Wendy, but considering Paul wasn't totally unscrupulous I suppose she was safe after she did what he asked. Other than his wife dying, Paul Jenkins seemingly had a perfect life up till his retirement. Even his plans to move in with his sister Julie in their childhood home in the place they grew up seemed set to be a bed of roses. He forgot about the thorns. Everything went perfectly -- reconnecting with his sister, son, old friends, old flame, remodeling the house -- until the night a burglar broke in. Death intrudes several times, or should I say gets invited in? Julie's away on vacation, so she has no idea what nefarious schemes her brother carried out until she comes home and gets a ghost of an idea. There were times I almost despised Paul, but in the end he did prove that he could still put a few other people before himself. Richard Gardner found me on Goodreads and offered me a chance to read a PDF of his book for a review because he saw that paranormal was one of my favorite genres. How he found me among countless members is beyond me, but I'm very glad he did. I enjoyed reading Deadly Partnership very much and look forward to reading more by him.
4	Keep all of my important papers inside it
4	I love the glitter in this case!! At times, it may seem like a bit much (it sometimes gets pooled in a corner and has a hard time getting free), but it's very fun! One downside I've noticed with this case is that the hole for the headphone jack doesn't exactly line up, so a little finagling may be needed to plug it in.
4	Great intro to the older kids version. Not as sturdy and my 4 yo can't set it up by himself but he enjoys it.
4	Product works for the item listed which is nice. The charger end must be inserted at just the right angle for the shaver to receive it, wish it was a bit easier. Outside of the slightly awkward fitment, product seems solid.
4	This hand exerciser is just what I needed since slightly injuring the muscles in my hand . Just by squeezing the metal coil I can feel it helping to flex that muscle. It's like instant therapy.
4	Smaller than I expected but looks to be okay quality for the price. I would not put a lot of pressure on the peg remover as it doesn't appear to be very strong. A good value though.
4	The Chair is more like a green/dark grey color. Different from the photo (medium grey) . For my little space works fine. Read the measurements before, is very small.
4	Nice book but definitely for a more mature reader than I was anticipating
4	Love it, and it's so beautiful. But didn't give 5 stars because the seem could be neater. I'm hoping that it will hold up to repeated usage.
4	I wanted something for everyday n this is perfect..
4	Not sure about the protection aspect yet! Came on time and fit the phone!
4	Cute suit! Love the ruffle and when it goes up while swimming you still have coverage from the high waisted bottom. Ordered a second one in a different color combo
4	Great product! The case itself scratches easily though. Everything else seems to work just fine
4	these are really soft and comfortable but I think they run a little big
4	This stamp isn’t very beginner friendly, but I also think that it’s probably the same for all nail stamps. It took a while for me to figure out how to get the polish to stick to the stamp. But after many practice rounds (and YouTube videos) I figured it out! I love the wide selection of templates. Once you get the hang of it, it’s fun to design your own nails!
4	very nice pillows for decorative covers, but not quite as full as I would like.
4	Meets my basic need.
4	Great sturdy cable! Looks long lasting. I just hope they are all 3 feet long. Since the longer one charges slower. The 3 feet works great
4	Did not like how my package was handled
4	Nice umbrella for the money. Thin lightweight fabric that I hope holds up thru many summers. So far so good. Love the Lime Green.
4	Great chew toy and not as easy to destruct, although my Parsons Jack Russell is pretty good at demolishing toys. He has chewed the edges off already and there are little bits of rubber laying all over, but it lasts longer than other toys. All in all some of his favorite toys
4	They are very thin, but if you're just trying to root out some starts for a few weeks, it's good enough for that.
4	I haven't been able to use it tracking a critter yet. I have tested it in various "simulations" to ensure it will help me. I got it because I'm red/green color blind so I sometimes struggle picking up blood on it's own which is frustrating. I do feel this will help me greatly after testing it out. The strength of the light and overall build quality is excellent. I now keep it in my hunting pack at all times to help when the moment comes.
4	I bought 3- one each for fridge and 2 freezers. When they tip over they spill. Would give 5 stars if had mesh covering to prevent spillage. I made my own with a few layers of cheesecloth over the holes.
4	Bought this and gifted to a friend. This stuff is amazing. She's been getting eyelash extensions for years but The cost of those extensions were too expensive. So I bought this stuff Because she mentioned about this type of product. She was thrilled to get the serum. She loves this so much and I'm glad I got this.
4	Works well. Nice color. Don't use it as much as I thought I would.
4	Very basic cheap sleeve. it will keep scuffs to a minimum.
4	I'm buying another, because the one I bought in April of 2017 is finally coming apart. Value, you bet. I put 40,000 miles on my car every year, and if I rent a car I take it with me. Easy install? Eh, I drive an SUV so I've grown accustomed to adjusting it when it needs it.
4	Everything they said it would be. Some were better than others but overall they all were good.
4	Absolutely love the crackers the flavor if you’re doing low-carb I give them a thumbs up. The downside is they are very costly for a cracker and I wish I could buy them somewhere and not have them shipped because they arrive mostly broken up. I had a hard time finding one whole cracker in the bay
4	Flash/light does not work
4	.Good quality we're definitely buy from the seller I received it very quickly I would definitely order again from this company
4	Like the look and initial quality of this product.
4	This would have 5 stars but it cut my internet speed in half, 200 Mbps down to 91 Mbps. Other than that an awesome product.
4	If you just need to consume some calories and protein, this works. It definitely doesn't taste amazing or even remotely natural, and it's a bit on the thick side, but for convenience it's completely fine and the after taste dissipates pretty quickly. Tastes a bit like cheap chocolate with sweetener but as I said, the taste fades fast.
4	Husband loves them they are very nice and sturdy
4	Very comfortable and sturdy. Great amount of compression!
4	can't answer the durability question just go the product.
4	Nice beginner guitar for the price.
4	It took a long time to wait. I planted them and really want beauty to grow.
4	Ours broke and we needed a replacement. I found this one and it worked perfectly. Its now 5 months later and the down and back keys aren't working as well. (Probably cause its one of the most used keys.) I'm very satisfied with the price to value so I will be buying another.
4	I really liked this film! I think the casting was key... the Actor who played Jovan had me engaged from the start with his moral dilemma. Overall, the acting was well done, the production quality was consistent and well executed and the storyline was fresh but with twists. You can tell the director spent a lot of time making each shot the best it could be. Great job by all involved.
4	I literally put this out there 5 minutes ago immediately after the postman left and it seems to work. My water bath is ridged at the bottom so unfortunately the suctions won’t work but that’s not a fault of the pump. I like it but make sure you have this in direct sunlight and plenty of water in the bird bath.
4	I'm really happy with the case. It's stylish and the color looks great. Complaints are that the pads on the bottom fell off (good thing replacements are included) and the keyboard cover doesn't lay as flat as I'd hoped.
4	My sister bought this, but she said that she didn't read it throughly, since it had bad words or inappropriate parts. Book is complete.
4	This is a cute swimsuit, but the top offers deceptively little coverage and tends to slip down when I'm moving around. Luckily, you can tighten the straps, so that does help a bit with that problem. Still, I would not recommend this swimsuit for anything who wears larger than a C cup.
4	I did not dislike anything about the product it was a great fit and my son loves them
4	Great sound. Video is good.
4	Absolutely love this set!! Super pretty without being overdone, only wish the bra straps were adjustable! I’m 5’5” and 130 lbs for reference
4	These were very adorable and though the one for the older kids was kind of small in length, it still made her dress pop!!
4	I ordered these boots in brown and received them in black - my third order that was incorrect from this seller! That said, I probably would have kept them, but they were far too large even though I ordered a half-size down as indicated in other reviews. I would caution other buyers to consider ordering a full-size down. That said, the boots seemed sturdy and were comfortable when I tried them on, and the style is just as nice as in the photos. Might try ordering again in a smaller size and pray the fourth time is the charm!
4	Came packaged nicely, however it was covered in lint..???? Super comfortable but the lint was rather annoying to remove.
4	Both for myself as a gift. Can’t beat the price
4	Lighter duty than previous printer MX 922 which we had for years. Paper tray capacity is smaller. Annoying that it forces you to use the rear paper feed for large format photo paper. It automatically changes the setting if you try to say you are printing 8 1/2 x 11 on photo paper. Main reason I chose the model is for the independent color ink cartridges. So many printers have a single cartridge for all colors resulting in a lot of waste when only one runs out.
4	Sneezy sure sang a lot. If you like Hank and his music you should like this.
4	Cute and served a purpose for a holiday party but not high quality for heavy use or multiple uses. I wear size 9 women’s, shoe covers fit well but pointed toe doesn’t stand up like in picture and I kept tripping over it.
4	Absolutely wonderful need to get 3 more
4	The charging and mounting worked great, but the release for the phone grip is a button behind the phone. Usually, without a case, your phone can depress this button and close the grip. However, some cases will have a gap near the button such that the button doesn’t depress.
4	Frame isn't wood but looks close. Sturdy board for the price.
4	I bought this thinking it was an iron on product for tshirts, but it is for decals. You also need to purchase transfer paper with it. For sticker decals, this is ok, its easier than rolls in certain ways.
4	Really cute! Ordered it for a toddler, fit perfect. Does come folded so takes a while to flatten.
4	Air needle is located in a compartment on the pump handle. Otherwise a good product.
4	One of my favorite movies . Drama and passion. Kinda predictable but still great for all ages.
4	This movie is a good classic
4	The pockets inside the bag are not thought out well. It makes it hard for this bag to be used for general daily purposes. It is only best for thin books and laptops. Otherwise good quality.
4	This was for gift-giving.
4	Wow! I love this cookbook! This cookbook are simple to follow and very healthy as well. The recipes are extremely tempting and at first look sufficiently basic, with this extensive variety of recipes I can make diverse dishes for my family consistently.
4	I received the wrong color the first time and had to reorder. But that happens.
4	Bought for our camper because these won't break. We like the thumb notch in the handle and the size. Coffee doesn't stain them.
4	I bought the teal color in both twin size and king size. The color is true to the picture - very bright. The twin size came rolled up in it's own container. The king size came vacuum packed and have may have been a return previously. I hope not b/c these are gifts. I did unzip the container and the blanket feels very soft. There is no smell. The price was great. So it is white on the sherpa side and teal on the top side. Now to the sage/green one. Very pale color but otherwise same as above. Again, a gift.
4	I was looking for something to keep me warm and soft, lately I have anxiety thinking of going to ross/marshalls/tjmaxx to go through all the racks and try to find a hoodie or etc. and try them all in dressing rooms only to find out it is too big or small! Anyways thats why I ordered this from amazon, the thing is I really liked it but I wish it was a bit thick and keeps you more warm but overall I liked it. I am gonna wear in the house and maybe while sleeping now in LA it is getting cold at nights. But if you are looking for something to wear outdoors and keep you warm this is not the product for you,and pockets have a weird fabric inside like polyester which I do not like. And hand wash only which is a problem for me we will see how it goes 😀
4	First one had a small leak on the faucet. Returned it, easy process. New one works great. Using it for church every week, so still holding up.
4	Good shoes for the price
4	This hatchet has very good head to total weight balance. I was disappointed with the narrow grip area on the handle. I plan on adding leather to the handle. Very sharp and stays that way.
4	It does the job, but not as sturdy as we had hoped. We thought that we were getting a higher grade of metal, but it is what we ordered.
4	I am disabled from terminal cancer, and pretty much doomed to live out the remainder of my days under home hospice and laid up on my comfortable couch. My large den is mostly lit by the neon signs I've purchased to adorn my man cave, with other lamps near the walls that sit on end tables and such. But I needed one light to hang over the arm of my couch with remote operation to give my immediate area some brightness at a touch, whether it be for reading or whatever. The lamp came in a deceptively small, but stout box. It assembled in moments, and was no problem to twist its light so that it hung directly over my shoulder and gave me the light I was needing. Its plenty bright to read by, or construct models, or whatever I can imagine I'd need. And the ability to adjust the light from a warm glow to a cool white is a nice touch. If I had any complaint, it would be the remote. Where still smaller than most other remotes I own, I don't think it warrants the need for five presets and AA batteries (not included). It's just a minor gripe that I thought I'd add on an otherwise perfect fit for what I was needing. A smaller remote that used AAA batteries and a smaller inventory of face buttons just seems much more feasible for such a simple device. For example, there is a button for "breastfeeding" that is indicated by the picture of a milk bottle. Ummm... okay then. But at any rate, great product! Keep in mind, I've only had it for only three days or so, so I cannot speak on item longevity.
4	The speaker is nice looking, small and light. It looks exactly as the photo shows. The sound is ok. Definitely not Bose quality or even close to it. But for $18 the sound quality matches the price. I’m using this speaker for my bedroom, so it’s fine. I wouldn’t use this as a speaker for a large area like a living room.
4	Well in the picture it says it has 2 vibrators when it really has only one. Other than that it's light and very versatile, I use it for my herniated disc and my epicondylitis and it's great that it's wireless cos I can take it with me to trips and restaurants and stuff. I just think the publicity has to be more accurate. It wouldn't hurt if it really had 2 vibrating points, and better yet, that not only the middle part vibrated but all 3 sections we're functional. Just an idea for Homedics.
4	Another good Samantha Wolf mystery. I'm not usually big on supernatural type stories but it isn't over done and seems to fit perfectly with this series. I've enjoyed them all, and like another reviewer said, the stories just seem to get better and better. Each book can be stand-alone if you desire, as the author explains who the characters are in each story and each story has a satisfying conclusion, but it's much more fun to read them all and that's what I recommend. By the way, I'm a 68 year old male, so don't just consider them only for girls or younger readers. Now I've got to buy the next one so I don't miss anything!
4	It's a very nice foundation. Not 5 star nice but good
4	So far, so god. Just started playing this game.
4	It's fun but she gets annoying! I am just glad she didn't "come to life" in the middle of the night forcing me to have to shoot it!!
4	Great tap show for the price. My only complaint is the sound quality isn’t that great but to be expected at this price point.
4	I really like this product, it very good! I will order more! 👌
4	Fits and looks nice . Many color choices . No advertising on hat , comfortable sizing strap .
4	THE BATTERY ONLY LAST ABOUT 4 HOURS BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S GOOD QUALITY.
4	Love them!!! However, after I sanded and washed them, they were a bit rough and I feel like they might splinter.
4	Not as loose fitting as I was suspecting.
4	Performing well so far.
4	This is made out of quality material. The Velcro is strong and the brace forces your shoulders back without pinching or discomfort. It is a smaller brace though and not one size fits all. It fits a child or someone with a small build the best. My 12 year old brother is using it and it fits well.
5	Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.
5	These earbuds sound just like the Apple ones I bought my daughter, but for a fraction of the cost. These came with a nice little pouch and a charging cable too. I highly recommend them.
5	Just Awesome durability and its as exactly as the seller had described even better this is my first time buying this kind of Kit and I tell you what I am so proud of it I love it love it love it is so awesome I recommend the seller to anyone seller is an amazing seller and is true to their word thank you for sending such an awesome package From Irma McKnight
5	Exactly like the pictures. Be careful when pulling them off the sticky strip bc they are delicate and sometimes rip in half.
5	Great movie ! Loved it !
5	The light is very helpful for dark colored yarns.Very comfortable to use.
5	needed it so worth it
5	This is a great discus for the price.
5	The packaging was so cute And they sent a free gift. The cover is very soft and I recommend it
5	Too snug. Needed to get an 11 not 10
5	Great for closeups. I put my makeup on better.
5	This was a gift for my mom she loves them and would recommend these house shoes.
5	My favorite vitamins. Good product.
5	Good case so far that is very slim to the phone. I like that there is not a very bulky case around the phone to hide the beauty of the iPhone, but you can tell there is protection. I have not dropped the phone yet to test and hope not to lol. Aces so far.
5	Wonderful to sleep on. Was considering getting a new mattress and I'm not anymore. I have a memory foam top layer on my mattress that I felt wasn't supporting me by the morning. My new topper firms it up while remaining soft and comfortable. Also just moved to CA, and I don't think it's hotter to sleep on than my regular mattress at all. If anything it actually cools me down a bit.
5	Great product, easy to assemble and gold finish is superb!
5	So VERY HAPPY I purchased this flag!!! The quality, colors and design are OUTSTANDING! I gave to my Best Friend who likes to watch the Kentucky derby and other horse racing. She LOVED it and has it flying in the front of her home. It is so well made and sturdy material. I know she will have it for many years.
5	James Kipling writing style is awesome! This murder mystery book had me at the edge of my seat.
5	Love this playpen, it was very very easy to put together, just open and zip in the bottom. Bought this for my grandsons pet mini lop bunny and he has plenty of room to hop around and my grandson likes to get in it with the bunny too. I would recommend for any small animal.
5	Awesome. Easy to get in and out of. Well constructed with durable fabric.
5	very nice quality product
5	A great rug especially for the price - very soft on your feet
5	Looks JUST like an authentic LV cover! No one can tell. I get compliments all the time too! It's very well made! Very happy with it!
5	Came as expected. Packaged great. Nice and tight. That’s typical for ipower though. I have purchased many things Over the years from these guys and have never been disappointed. So far this is working great for my seedlings. 3 of these side by side approx 2 to 3 feet apart and I’ve got hundreds of seedlings thriving. Low power usage and low heat u can’t beat it for the price.
5	This is a GREAT belt! I love everything about it and am really enjoying wearing it everyday. Really excellent quality. A+++
5	I bough it for my baby ! Couse I really need a product like it ! And it works great! I set time and temperature! Real good ! My family very like too !
5	Pyramid as described, well done. The stone is black and beautiful, it surface is unpolished but very soft . At first touch it stained my fingers with a fine black dust but after a thoroughly wash the pyramid did not stained my hand anymore.
5	LOVE THESE!!! they fit so well and my ginormous 5 month old will be able to wear them for a bit longer!!!! seriously the best purchase
5	I use to get these at this cute little shop in Eureka Springs, AR but since moved away and SO SO badly wanted these candles. They burn even the fragrance smells the whole house 2000 sq ft. I am a Candle freak and these are BY FAR the best I have ever burned.
5	I like the vr built in headphones.You need to download 3D app or find 3D videos on You Tube to watch, but it's worth the money.I don't know how to express my word, it is amazing watching video. Well built.
5	The washcloths are very soft, I like the little handles they have, color variety is great as I and my children each use a different color.
5	A great stand for my iPhone. I use it at night and it is perfect for what I need it for. I use a Steelie in my truck so it is a perfect companion for it.
5	Nothing I dislike it has met my expectations!
5	Great for the price, can't beat it.
5	This top is adorable
5	The item arrived on time and in a good condition and it works great. Also I will continue to purchase from this company in the near future.
5	I got it today. I'll put it on the front porch and the back yard and the garbage can. It's very good. It's light, sensitive, convenient, very practical.
5	This bag has a good quality material, I’m surprised the size is a good size. Perfect for a weekend get away!
5	Great, effective herbal remedy for a sensitive urinary bladder.
5	Purchased 7 pair and they were a hit with the kids. All of them worked just fine.
5	i got one as a baby shower gift and fell in love with it i had to buy my sister in law one for her shower
5	The microscope is easy to use and I can connect it to my phone. It has a high definition and can be photographed clearly in the dark, it is very small and easy to carry.
5	I was skeptical of this safe because of some bad reviews. However this is one of my favorite purchases. Everything works perfectly for several months thus far. The video of the guy easily breaking into the safe is a bit misleading; however there is an access "key slot" under the Stanley plate. If you're that worried about someone breaking in I suggest a bigger safe and a change of location haha. I added two motion sensor lights to the inside which really makes a huge difference. The door had a little play in it when closed, a thin foam tape fixed that. I also read a review about finger print issues; if you dont reset the safe before entering prints then any print will work, says so in the manual. Do a proper setup and it works great. If your worried about speed of access I suggest logging your middle finger as well, you can then hit the key and read your print in one motion thia is also much more comfortable. Another thing is log your finger in several positions for easy access. Somehow I was able to disable the open door alarm which I was happy about. I intend to mount this inside a large gun safe so the fact that it is not fireproof is less of an issue to me otherwise that would be the only downside. Highly recommend this safe.
5	Do not like the roll on's at all but it's okay
5	I use this lockbox for third party work. It is easy to use and sturdy. Very convenient and secured way to store keys for someone else to access my property.
5	I enjoyed this product because its cooling and feels great when you put it on and take it off. Highly recommended.
5	Fits as expected. No complaints. 😊
5	Perfect size for carrying two dolls and some of their accessories. The bottom of the tote has a zippered compartment perfect for outfits and small pieces. The tote is well made. It was purchased for use with the 14" Wellie Wisher dolls from American Girls.
5	Exactly what I expected. Great product!
5	Smaller than I thought but still really nice
5	Product looks amaizing and excited to add this to my daily supplement intake.
5	This is the best stuff ever for dry skin! I love it! Great price too!
5	The Spigen Thin Fit is in my rotation on every phone I buy.
5	Very happy with this item
5	These are working out great for my vehicle. Big improvment.
5	Since I was a beginner flying drones, I’ve had several questions. Holy stone has been great answering my question in a timely manner. Flying the drone with my grandson has been a great experience. If you are interested in a drone, I would recommend Holy Stone. They have been a pleasure to work with.
5	Worth every dollar spent, I use this in my garden and in my kitchen. It’s very durable and folds up small enough for easy storage. I’m short so the extra height definitely helps!
5	This wand and washer ends were the perfect replacement on our Honda power washer.
5	This is a great read in the life of a legend
5	My rats seem to really enjoy these . I will purchase them again.
5	I love this mirror! It’s both battery and plug in operated. I love that it’s affordable and light weight
5	Why is such good flavoring hard to find! Well no more! Excellent!! Right up there next to Watkins which seems overly expensive anymore and i love the bigger bottle and the flavor is top notch!’ Love how affordable 1 bottle is! My new go to brand!!
5	Heats well and it is lightweight.
5	I bought this for my daughter who just became a teen and all of a sudden has broken out. I attribute it to her not cleaning her face as well as she should and of course hormones! She was tickled when I gave it to her. She loves that it fits into the palm of her hand easily so she has not problem gripping it. She has been using it since we got it and loves it. I am pleased knowing that she is getting her skin squeaky clean.
5	light, comfy , and very good sound!
5	Cheap, but works WELL!
5	I just finished reading the last book, and I am sad it is the end of the series. I truly enjoyed playing sleuth alongside Margot Durand, and oftentimes I would be able to solve the murder, only to be trumped by a fresh piece of evidence. I will miss North Bank!
5	It is fantastic! I bought similar lights from other websites, and they have poor quality. Although this one is more expensive than others, I think it is worthy. It is really a good decoration for dorm! I will probably buy one more to give my mother as a gift!
5	Priced very well. I trust NOW products.
5	Very good algae remover for the price
5	Absolutely one of the best hoods you can get!!! I was completely blown away by the clarity and field of view provided by this hood! I've tried others and this one is unrivaled. Been using it two months now and that automatic feature is a lifesaver! If you have the money definitely get this hood, you won't be disappointed!
5	Love these for dressy to casual they look stunning!
5	My son loves this. Just wish there was a low volume option on it
5	Perfect gift for college student.
5	This product offers a burning sensation because it's cooling down the inflammation in your eyes. If you can't handle it buy something that probably won't work as well. Not me. This is it.
5	My husband does the outdoor grilling and he loves it.
5	Nice glasses. Easy to tell who’s drink is who’s.
5	The quality of the product is good. It's fits nicely and easy to apply. This is by far the best experience that I had when buying glass screen protector online. Will definitely purchase from this seller again.
5	I love this body wash. The lemon smell is so nice. Have been using it for several years.
5	Arrived on time and in one piece.
5	I bought this for my husband’s 60th birthday he put on on for his birthday party and again two days later. He loved it. It did well when it was washed.
5	I am happy I purchased this product. I love these straws. They even come with a tiny telescoping cleaning brush that fits inside each straw. These stay extended like they are supposed to and work great.This doesn't take up anymore room than a tube of lipgloss and would fit in your pocket too.
5	Although this pump is smaller it works great for the value. I used it on the farm to spray fence rolls and it can reach over 10 feet of stream. We are very please
5	Extreamly comfortable material, very soft and form fitting. Doesnt even feel like its there
5	This bag fits nicely under the seat or at your feet in the car. It has multiple pockets for easy access to your phone, water bottle, etc. The interior of the bag holds make-up, medical supplies, books, etc. It's deceivingly "large" due to it's configuration and pockets. I am not searching or fumbling for items, therefore, not annoying the person sitting next to me. Best of all it has a built-in strap at the back, so it slides right on top of another suitcase or carry-on.
5	This is so great on garden fresh veggies. Thank you for your quick service
5	Excellent- good support for injuries.
5	Just got my coins in today and they are awesome! Super shiny, good weight, and great quality! They came in a very nice case, I would highly recommend!
5	Great pair of boots. The fit is perfect, the inside is lined with a soft somewhat furry material that doesn't feel padded, which I really like. It quite literally hugs your feet but it's made in such a way that you can line it with socks for added warmth if you need to. It doesn't hurt that it's pretty, so all in all great purchase.
5	This cake decorating kit has everything I need for decorating my cake; all the tools were so useful for me. I bought this set for No regrets! I love the two large icing spatula are so straight and easy to hold and adjustable scraper was perfectly smooth out my cake. I also had a fun time while doing it! Right tool for the job! I highly recommend this set!
5	They fit like a glove. Easy to install.
5	This is one of the first books in a long time I did not want to finish. All three of the books are captivating. They are tied into each other but you get to know each character even better. Which you will love with these books. I got close to every person. It is like a TV series you don't want the season to end. But you can't wait for the next!
5	Just as expected, arrived timely
5	This seller is amazing. First i have to say that i love this baby monitor. It does all you want and need (great day and night camera with zoom, great audio with audio light indicator, long battery, good talk back sound, very resistant monitor and the parents monitor is small enought so it fit in a back pocket). I totally recommand thia maby monitor. You can also have more than one camera set up but i didnt try it. No need for me Almost a year after purchase, i had a small issue with my parental monitor. Would charge properly. I wouldnt say this was a defective issue of the monitor but more a usage issue (Probably bb that keep pulling the cord). I contacted them. Their costumer service is amazing and also the people working for them. Same day responses to multiple emails and they were very helpful and very fast. I totally recommand you to contac them if you have any issue.
5	Wonderful. Shipping from Amazon could be better.
5	I have tears in both rotator cuffs and have a lot of pain. I thought this was just another gimmick but am willing to try practically anything for some relief. It came in the mail super fast. I took it out of the package and my first thought was "What a pleasant smell". No plastic. Not overpowering. Just a waft of lavender. It is super soft and the feel is excellent. I tried it straight out of the box - no heating, no cooling. Oh. My. God. Just the warmth of the material, the scent & the weight were enough to give me some relief. I can't wait to try it heated up if it feels this good right now. I will definitely be ordering several more for family members for gifts!
5	My kids love this and it's easy for them to use.
5	I was looking for cable and luckily I found this from Amazon. I like how it comes with three in a pack and I can tell the material is durable and well made. Considering the price, that's a great buy!
5	In the summer I wear a darker shade of makeup. These wash cloths make it a breeze to get my makeup off the wash cloth!
5	I need something to hold my new prescription glasses - I wanted to protect my Coach glasses and this was perfect. Double protection and great to toss in beach bag
5	This is a superb devotional I am a connoisseur of devotionals and this is one of the best I’ve ever read Brian and Michelle did their due diligence and pointing us to Jesus and to referencing all of the places in the series that they could and the lessons learned I would recommend this to anyone it is beautiful inside and out ! Well done!
5	didn't expecte get such sharpe carving knife by this price, but it's ture!
5	All parts came in place works great
5	Had for a few weeks now. Working great, has enough capacity to last all night long.
5	Works great, good purchase to protect instruments
5	Bracelet arrived on time in beautiful packaging (no need to rewrap if you don't want to). The poem inside is beautiful. At first I thought bracelet was super tiny, but realized needed to be for an infant to wear, and it adjusts up for communion and to wedding nicely. It seems fragile and delicate, so maybe for special occasional wear only. All in all, a beautiful gift.
5	Just what I wanted. Arrived on time.
5	The material is wonderful and they washed up great. No need to iron them.
5	This frame was perfect for a poster we've been wanting to hang. Looks like real glass but of course light weight. Would repurchase. Very easy to hang.
5	Everything feels and works great. Confident it will last
5	Recently bought three sets of these laces in different colors. Have replaced all of the tie laces in my sneakers with these and am very happy. They were easy to use and have eliminated that feeling of your shoes tightening as your feet swell throughout the day. Plus they make putting your shoes on and off so much easier. Of course they frayed after cutting them, but that is no big deal as they ends are entrapped in the end closure. Good bargain that this price.
5	Traction pad was AMAZING can surf very well with it
5	Good quality easy to read Bible
5	GREAT PRODUCT. USE A LOT OF THESE.
5	I add this to my smoothies! It doesn’t negatively affect the texture or taste at all. I highly recommend it!
5	The cabinet exceeded my expectations. It looks a lot nicer and sturdier than I thought it would be. It came in a large, very heavy box. The UPS driver left it at our doorstep. The box was so heavy that I couldn’t drag it inside. So, I cut the box open and removed the individual parts and brought them inside. Although there was some slight damage to the exterior of the box, all the inside contents were intact without any scratches or blemishes. Nothing was missing. I and my 13 years old grand daughter were able to assemble it in about 3 hours. The instructions weren’t very good, but it wasn’t too hard for me to figure out how everything goes together, because I have previously assembled similar cabinets. The cabinet looks gorgeous in my kitchen. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a budget curio cabinet.
5	Nice look and protects
5	This is awesome!!!!! Easy to assemble and use!
5	I love this tama! This is my second On and I plan on getting the white when it is released. Worth the money.
5	These get the strangest reactions from our Puppy. At first, it terrified him. He’d walk way around it. Then, it became his favorite toy. The mechanism that makes it jump and talk is very sturdy. He’s never torn it up at all. Now they cute covering lasts a little longer than most plush toys, but eventually he is able to rip it up. He loves it so much, I’ve order a total of five, I think. This toy definitely keeps a puppy busy. English Mastiff
5	Love this product, I’ve noticed a huge difference in the clarity of my skin and tone after using 5 weeks and I haven’t gotten any new pimples since I started using it. It’s actually clearing my skin up and making it look softer at the same time. I’m also using the peptide serum right after it’s a great combo to use this cleanser and one of their serums right after morning and night. Eva’s is organic and a good product I’m glad I trusted it! Will def be offering more.
5	We have 7 of these cases and they work great! So far it’s been a great product!!
5	great product priced well and look great in the crib
5	The jewelry came just as pictured and just what I wanted. The size/colors are good too.
5	Love this tumbler. Doesn't sweat in the heat and ice takes a long time to melt. Definitely will buy again!
5	Morning preparations for work
5	Pretty and easy to wear
5	This helps me save money, nothing wrong with that, right?
5	Speechless!!! i cannot believe i haven't heard of this before, Best Quick portable charger with the convenience to charge my device on the go! the design is so slick and the device fits right in effortlessly , It charges up extremely fast and has a great feel to it as well, Must have for anyone with a Juul Device
5	I absolutely love this bag. I'm hoping to get another one on Prime Day!
5	Got a chance to use this at school and absolutely love it. I like the convenience of having it at home and not having to lug it around. For a teacher, it allows me to create notes and answer keys my students can see me working out. Would definitely recommend it!!
5	They advertise that you can roll the hat---and you can!
5	I use these vibrant yellow placemats for outdoor dinners. They are easy to clean. I love the yellow and with our round table they fit perfectly. They arrived wrapped in plastic and on time.
5	Works as described with my Fitbit.
5	There isn't much to say about SD cards. I have several digital cameras at the ready. I bought several used cameras. I'm an insurance adjuster and the cameras wear out or I drop them, sometimes off of a roof. I bought these cards for each of my backup cameras. Excellent value.
5	Quality, mostly easy to use boxes. A little over priced as you could shop locally but in the age of convenience Amazon does it best.
5	Just received the umbrella in a lightly damaged box but luckily the bag of parts didn’t fall out. Everything was in perfect condition and went together like a breeze. I am very happy with my purchase. I think I will anchor it to my deck with the awesome stand provided with holes to enable that to happen. I love the shade and quality of the umbrella.
5	So far I like the product. Took it to camp for two days. Used it on and off for 4 hours each night for two days. Still didn’t have to charge it.
5	I like the softness and length. It is also light but not too thin.
5	I liked the convenience of ordering this online and that it arrived promptly.
5	This really works last all day even on deep lines
5	This product has already impressed me. I bought this razor just a few days ago and have used it multiple times already! It does not pull or tug like other razors I have used. I am a big fan of the multiple attachments that come with this razor, the nose hair attachment is one I will use the most!
5	Love this radio...gets great reception and sound for a little radio at $12!
5	There is nothing wrong with it, great quality, plug in into your display port and will show HD quality images on your screen.
5	This unit works very well. It has all the bells and whistles, yet is compact and easy to understand. I can recommend it.
5	This book was excellent. It provides an in-depth discussion into creating mental models that align with the mental models of users. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the subject.
5	Bought as a gift for my daughter, seems like good quality.
5	flexible microwave lids in graduated sizes that fit inside one another through the central button handle - work well, excellent price. Anticipate they will be durable.
5	This pillow is the best thing I have ever purchased in my life! It’s so comfortable I feel like I’m sleeping in a cloud. It feels like I’m being cuddled on both sides. I’m 29 weeks pregnant at the moment and I have yet to be uncomfortable because of my belly. This pillow is a miracle. I can’t even lay on it without sleeping. I do, however have to buy more filling from the pillow losing a little firmness. Also in the picture it looks longer, but that doesn’t bother me. I will definitely be using this even after I’ve had my baby. I 100% recommend this buy. No regrets.
5	Very bright light bulb, material seems very solid. Price is a lot cheaper than branded ones
5	I have a hard time with off shoulder shirts sometimes, it seems like they want to ride up onto my shoulders. This shirt didn’t do that at all, it stayed exactly where it should be. I even danced in it. I love the sleeve accents and the lace, the shirt makes me feel very pretty. I adore it.
5	Solid vice. I ordered a cheap one that I instantly returned because it was like a toy. This Vice is big, solid and can handle whatever I throw at it.
5	Does what it is supposed to do, and has a standard micro USB plug, a plus!
5	I got this for my daughters room and it is very cute! It's low to the ground so I wouldn't recommend for big adult but perfect for girls room.
5	I love that these bottles were just the right size to travel with. This is my new daily cleaner. I'm not sure if it is possible but my glasses seem to stay cleaner longer. Easy to use and works very well. I think this is a great value for the money as well
5	The case arrived promptly as most Amazon prime orders do. It holds the new Nintendo 3DS XL and games perfectly. It is a good sturdy case, yet still very compact and portable.
5	This was one of the best purchases I've ever made. Turned a blank wall in my bedroom, into a huge entertainment screen for a very reasonable price. The only complaint I would have with it is that it doesn't produce great sound quality, to compare with how nice the picture is. So I would suggest getting a real speaker setup to go with this awesome purchase. Football sunday will never be better.
5	Was a bit skeptical at first but really such a good quality and great product. Would purchase again in he future!
5	omg is what you will say when you see this ,it very filling.I didn't think i could take this but with lube it went in,had to start slowly and enter only a inch at a time but after a few min wow.Would highly recommend. for beginners though.
5	love it! Will continue to order
5	Classics! Must-reads. So much depth for a "children's book," adults could read it a dozen times over and never cease to notice something new.
5	Very pleased with the decorations and there quality
5	We use this product regularly
5	Very thick coated metal, easy assembly. Will definitely buy again if needed.
5	Great product works great and produces a lot of ice
5	This water bottle is exactly what I had been searching for. It’s lightweight, and it’s easy for me to take everywhere. It does not leak at all. I absolutely love this bottle!
5	This keto book is exceptional and i think best book ever and i really recomanded it
5	Check the amazon.de site. It is MUCH cheaper there.
5	I ordered this shoulder strap to replace a missing strap on a bag. It works well, is very sturdy and seems to be of good quality. I am using it regularly, and it works great
5	Great small lightweight rotary tool. It is not going to be as powerful as a big one, but this thing is very handy and compact. The charging is convenient. You can use a USB phone charger or computer. It has standard connectors.
5	This product are very good, just one thing.. in the photo looks bigger. I thought will be bigger, I know you wrote the size. I liked !!!!
5	I have ordered toner for both my laser jet printer and my ink jet printer and am very satisfied with the quality of the product, the unbeatable price and the quick delivery! Thank you
5	This is a great, inexpensive wireless charging pad. It's the first one I've owned so I can't compare it to anything else, but it charges my Pixel 3 just fine. My only gripe is that the phone needs to be completely centered on the pad in order for it to charge. Other than that, it's been great.
5	The book was well made, love that we have hints and answers if needed. Size of print is big and easy to read, the best part is there is room to write my answers within the book. I am enjoying the puzzles - it will definitely take me a while to complete though. When I am ready for a new book I will look to Patel Puzzle Books for that purchase.
5	Love the movie and the actors. Good take on King Author story.
5	May cost a few more dollars but very well made. Quality product.....I am not disappointed!
5	One of my favorite snacks, excellent way to control portions! At a great price too!
5	Well written and great illustrations!
5	Love that it streamlines 2 of our watches and I like that they aren’t on the table.
5	These were all Christmas gifts everyone loved their gifts
5	I still can't believe I dropped this much money on a duvet cover, it was more than the new down comforter we also bought! But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the "dust" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty. Sometimes it's nice to just splurge.
5	I use this on all my devices to clean, clear, find, and manage all files and downloads
5	Good quality, and they really come in handy!
5	The Ketogenic Kitchen is a good book for sure. Those tips made my day! Great recipes, now I can cook far better.
5	My grandson absolutely loves them!
5	Easy to install with a supporting frame, scratches free. Screen is only visible when looking perpendicular to it. This is really good when you want to keep your stuff from being seen by others
5	I am reading this book for a second time, such a good read.
5	It is difficult to find patchouli that is not too strong. These sachets are perfect. Thank you.
5	SO cute! and such a great price! I was in need of a new black leather bag for work and this has fit all the criteria for me! It holds a lot, is super comfy on my shoulder and I love that there is even an inside pocket! The perfect spot for me to throw my keys so they don't get lost in the other things inside the bag. Highly recommend if you don't want to break the bank for a simple black leather tote.
5	I slouch at work sitting at a desk all day. Was trying to find a good solution to help alleviate the slouching and back pain. This posture corrector has definitely helped! I am sitting straighter and the pain has lessened.This posture corrector has given me strong support for my back, without restricting my movements.
5	Good story and it flowed very well. I would like to read more so I have ordered more. Look forward to the hole series.
5	WHen I first received this product, I was very disappointed. It simply would not open for any of my cats. We even had them chipped for the express purpose of using this feeder! After a week, we finally brought the cat back in to check the location of their chips, and lo and behold, the cat who needed to use the feeder was missing its chip entirely!! I did not know they could fall out, but apparently ours did and that's why the feeder wasn't working. The vet replaced the chip for free and now the feeder works perfectly. It took about a week to train the cat to use it, but she has no issues with it and the other cat is constantly disappointed that the lid is closed. One note, though. It says that you can program how long the lid stays open after the cat leaves. In fact, there is just a 3 position switch. This is good enough for us, but it doesn't work the way I thought it would after reading the literature.
5	Love it can be used for any special occasion or just want to feel sexy
5	Great colors for a set!
5	This product is really great!!!
5	I have had many Bluetooth's and this one is the best so far. The sound barrier has been the most important part. When I have both ear buds in I cant hear any outside voices or anybody close to me in distance. It's important to me. My boyfriend is in Texas and when we video chat I need to hear him and only him and these allow me to do just that. Thank you wireless earbuds.
5	Great Product. The dual sided vibrations are perfect. Its great because its waterproof and easy to clean. And my wife loves the color
5	Needed these for sometime. I had odds and ends before but would generally use the wrong size and would mess up the screw head and spend twice amount of time fixing my mishap.
5	Makes my tower blue tooth- I thought it was useless after the iPhone changes to the input no longer mate.
5	No problems like them
5	Love this shower curtain was everything I was hoping for !!!!! Great quality and awesome price
5	Yay, I don’t have to vacuum under the bed manually with a hose anymore. This is nice to have as a busy parent.
5	Oh my gosh! I couldn't believe it! It works great! I have tried other products claiming it would remove tear stains, but nothing I've tried compares to this! I love it!
5	Works good, stands up to my wife's weight when she is using it. Easy install, just get a diamond tip if you are installing in tile and I used a heavier gauge drywall plug. Ones that came with it are probably fine, just chose not to use them. Good product
5	I tried this product as kind of a "why not?". I've had digestive issues for several years, and frequently get upset stomach and indigestion. These pills have really helped mitigate my digestive discomfort and I feel noticeably better after meals when I take them. I'm going to start having my husband take them as well.
5	This is a great book. I have read this bokk very well. There is no wrong and written with good contents
5	The best earl grey I've ever had - its the only one i'll drink now !!
5	Over all a good player. There are two ways to turn the thing on and off - a switch a the bottom will turn power completely off and a sleep mode which remembers your last settings. The only negative is the power out put is low so you have to raise the volume higher than most players. Doing so drains the batteries so that it realistically last about 20 hours.
5	Have brought these bowls twice love then great fro salads and meal prep
5	I bought one like this for my stepdaughter. She liked it so much as it helped her with her back pain I decided to get one for myself. I am very impressed with this. I am walking tall and not slouching. My back feels good. Thank you for such a great product.
5	Perfect size for a queen sleeper sofa with arm rests. Ordered another one as soon as the first one came. Dark Grey matched sofa perfectly.
5	The fabric material of this shirt is soft and flowy and the color doesnt fade when washed but the size does run small and its snug from the chest area so i would suggest ordering 1 size larger than what you usually wear. I personally really liked the ribbon tie that came with it... You can style it in different ways as you can see in the pictures attached.
5	This is well designed. I can exercise with no trouble while wearing it. It does help to relieve my knee pain.
5	Did have artificial flavors
5	I bought this one as a backup as binding tends to wear down. But I have another one like this and I've had four 5 months. Still works great.
5	Best runner I have ever purchased. Very good quality!
5	If you want to save time, money, and like to eat delicious food this book is for you. There are 70 recipes that have been written with step by step instructions to preparing healthy weight loss lunch recipes.
5	The flavor does not disappoint. Full of chocolate. Mixed perfectly with my coffee...no clumps...and gave me the extra boost I needed with energy and suppressing my appetite. Will be purchasing again!
5	My daughter loves this product to print photos from her phone and clip them onto a hanging string. This is a very easy and quick way to print.
5	I have a Note 8 but this was too cute to pass up. The buttons are slightly off on the sides but still easy to use.
5	They do exactly what I need them to for my combination skin. Love them, but I don't use them as often as I should probably :( ...however when I do my face feels great the next few days.
5	Looks great for my Gryffindor costume. Arrived quickly and well packaged.
5	Product matched expectations. Good value for the price.
5	Works great. Arrived in perfect condition!
5	Good quality classes, bought them for my girlfriend. She loves them, the only complaint is the tint is lighter so don’t expect high sun deflection.
5	Very pleased with purchase & quick delivery!
5	Very warm and fit great
5	Good quality, you won’t be disappointed!
5	I was skeptical that this would work to keep my hound dog quiet - but it works like a charm! Maybe because her nose is more sensitive?? We don't always put her bark collar on, but when we let her out at night when her barking would be more disturbing to neighbors, it works as described. Sometimes we only put the collar on and not activate it - that also works now that she associated the spray with the collar.
5	The entire Ballsy Boys Series is excellent! Looking forward to Pixies story !!! A very big fan of this writer !
5	These are the perfect size and so quiet in the classroom!!!
5	I took the phone out of its box and immediately put the screen protector on, so I didn't even have to clean it. It's pretty good, not exactly as good as a bare screen, but you get the protection. For me, not worrying as much about dropping the phone is important enough to give up the tiny amount of touch that is lost with any screen protector.
5	We bought these for a family trip to Lake Powell where summer daytime temperatures are regularly over 100. These cooling towels worked great to provide cooling relief from the heat. The multi-pack with 6 colors was great because everyone in my family got one and we could keep them straight. Highly recommended!
5	They work perfectly and were so easy to install
5	I'm very happy with this unit. I've read a lot of bad things, but in my case everything is working as it should and I'm very happy with it. I don't however spend a lot of time using it so those of you that are heavy on the soldering may have a more appreciated view than mine.
5	This was a gift, but looks great in person! I love floor puzzles & this Paw Patrol puzzle was very colorful.
5	Great all the way around.
5	Very good value for the price
5	These came in 4 separate packs inside one big plastic pack. They were the perfect size for cake pops. i feel like the 4 inch might work too, will try them and review when i do buy them.
5	There's a lot of value in price.I'll buy it again, and I'll think about more of that.My son also loves that these platforms can be connected at the bottom and top, so you can stack them up.
5	I live how easy it is to stick it into the AirPods. The actual skins are really nice and durable and I especially love their lifetime replacement guarantee which is great for people that worry they might mess the stickers up
5	Beautiful, I absolutely love this set. I wanted a decanter set to add a talking piece in our living room. I do recommend washing them out before you present them it will make them pop.
5	I absolutely LOVE these! Perfect size, and so beautiful.
5	Great table. It is beautiful and sturdy, everything I needed for my front patio.
5	Affordable product works great
5	Love this so much! I put my tree up early, and realized it was broken:( so I ended up with this one because all the ones in stores were SO expensive! This one was super affordable! Easy to assemble and I currently have Halloween decorations all over it! I love it so much!!’
5	We put this amazing light in our finished basement for our kids to enjoy and enjoy they do! As soon as homework is done off to play they go. I am so very pleased with every aspect of this light bulb. Fun for everyone.
5	It does what it's supposed to. Keeps the pesky bugs away.
5	Perfect for my daughter’s Bed. Love how easy it is to put on or take off. Color matched great. Love how it lays too.
5	I lose hair like it’s my job and my plumbing is not a fan. I have not had one issue with clogged drains since I bought this.
5	So glad that I purchased this. This really helps get any extra off my teeth, to the point where I may increase the length of time for dental cleanings. It feels like I've been to the dentist daily. Love it. It take me a few tries figuring out how to use this without spraying the room, but have it down pat now. :)
5	Nice for that price.
5	I’ve been using this product, since purchase. Very impressed
5	exactly what i wanted perfect for mu counter
5	I mean I used it the day it came in to remove a deep clog I had in my toilet and it was like I heard angels singing. WORTH EVERY PENNY!
5	Exactly what I wanted
5	Does exactly as advertised
5	Why didn’t the manufacturer include this? Very good fit in the Tundra and very useful.
5	Well , I guess it works. Like to give it less stars but this was my choice of refrigerators... Extremely expensive and I'm not even sure it was needed yet. It did arrive on time and it fit, as expected.
5	Totally worth every penny.
5	Pistachio Lovers Mix has the perfect mix of nuts. However, the last container I purchased in April 2019 had a few stale pistachios. They had a bitter taste. The other nuts were perfect though. I’ll keep ordering!
5	The cards are made with quality card stock and the pictures are clear, crisp. Absolutely stunning!! I love my cards!!
5	Works just like the OEM
5	I love these bras- BUT i received a black one with white deodorant marks on the pits! So that was a little startling! Sent it back and re ordered another. I hope i don't get the deodorant one again!
5	Smile laundry bag, there are more dirty clothes to see this bag will be happy. Very good quality!
5	I ordered this one for my daughter’s new phone and a completely different one for mine. I hate to admit that hers is so much better! It’s clear, shows off the color nicely, gives a feeling of a sturdy protection and cheap! Very satisfied with the purchase!
5	Keeps battery and oil filter warm. Easier starting when cold. Below 32f
5	Loved these. Unfortunately I forgot to take my keys off of one before handing them into my last job. 😭
5	Very good I like it very much
5	This wasn’t the doll I meant to buy and was pleasantly surprised! Great mistake on my part! This doll eats play-doh and its so much fun! She comes with only one diaper, but it’s not like it gets messy since just play-doh is falling into it. Our girls love to play with this doll and our play-doh kitchen set and cook meals for the baby. The inside of the doll is easily accessible if there is ever any play-doh stuck. The only issue we have had is forgetting to clean out her mouth at the end of play and the next time having to dig out hardened play-doh, but it’s a quick fix.
5	I use these to store diy mascara and eyelash/brow serum and they work just fine. No muss, no fuss! The kit comes with everything needed to make filling a tube as easy as possible. Glad I ordered these.
5	First things first, these are the best I have ever tried. I went to best buy first and tried all of the demo set's. These top all of them hands down. And for $50 just can't beat the price. Amazing product, I highly recommend them.
5	I used these to get through busy airports on vacation and I also used it when my two year old and I were swimming in the ocean. He has no fear and will swim out as far as he can go. The wrist links keep our hands free and I like how the adult wrist link comes off quickly if I need it to, while the toddler end is tougher to take off. These are very sturdy, don't get tangled up, and with the two lengths they are be exactly what I needed no matter the situation. The whistles might be good for an older child, but needless to say, with a two year old, I threw the whistles away. They are LOUD.
5	product 2 days early, and is an excellent coffee. ENJOY
5	My niece loves it! This is her first year in band in middle school, and it's perfect for her.
5	Good quality but gigantic. I new this going in but lol its huge. Coffees lovers Dream . I gave the thermos five stars but only three stars as giftable because most people wouldn't want this big of a thermos that's my opinion. Unless you are the Jolly Green Giant lol
5	Great price and lightly roasted for easy eating
5	Not beginner level. My 10 yr old is loving this. The colors are bright and the pattern is easy to read.
5	very cute. perfect baby shower gift for a friend
5	love the bands--will will order more colors-easy to install as well
